Lyrics:


You know you'll always be a part of me
You're trapped forever in my memory
Inside my heart, I keep a photograph
Reminding me of what we used to have
Can't go to places that we used to be
Can't handle that familiarity
If I saw you, I know I'd fall apart
Can't depend upon my broken heart

You're still gone
You're everywhere I go, but still gone
I look around, I know you're still gone
You're still gone, mmhmm

I swear I saw you on the street today
There for a moment, then you slipped away
I guess we see just what we wanna see
My mind is playing tricks on me

You're still gone
You're everywhere I go, but still gone
I look around, I know you're still gone
You're still gone
You're still gone
You're everywhere I go, but still gone
I look around, I know you're still gone
You're still gone, hey
