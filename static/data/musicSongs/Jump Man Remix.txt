Lyrics:


You know when I get quiet I'm always up to something, man
You know that, ha
That boy up to somethin'
Ayy, look

I'm laid over the bad bitch waiting on a package
Just had a flashback, I used to have a pissy mattress
And I done choosed to trap, it's what I had to do
The police riding up and down the avenue
As soon as they touch me, running it up on the boulevard
When you only keep it 100, I guess they can't pull your card
Fuck the lean, I'm on the Henny
Fuck your main, I'm gettin' plenty
I prolly pull up in my Honda, I drive wherever I wanna
And I was just starving on Friday but now I'm back balling on Tuesday
He probably hate on my bitches, runnin' round calling 'em groupies
I ride around with extensions, I keep it on me, I'm Gucci
I get a whole lot of Benji's, I put 'em on me like Boosie
I fuck up the juggin' for rappin', then I got right back to trappin'
I sold all the pounds for the profit, then hit the mall and went shoppin'
I'm who you call if you need me, need me, gon' get it, we got it
And I leave the gas up to Diesel, don't talk to me, switch the topic

I mean, yeah, it ain't nothing positive, it ain't about getting no money
I mean, where I'm at right now, you know what I'm sayin', I don't wanna have nothing to do with that shit, you feel me?
I wish everybody peace and blessings
