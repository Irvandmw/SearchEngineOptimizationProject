Lyrics:


Even if I had a month
Even if I had a day
I still wouldn't get it
Girl I admit it
I wouldn't ever want to change

I never know what you'll do
And that's what keeps me into you
While I may keep trying there's no denying
I'm gonna play the fool
'Cause I'm twisted and tortured over you

You're letting me in, you're locking me out
You're building me up, you're knocking me down
You're beautifully flawed
And that's what I love about you
That's what I
That's what I love about you

Baby you're holding my hand
You're leading me on
I'm in over my head
My sanity's gone
You're beautifully flawed
And that's what I hate about you
And that's what I love about you

Seems like I got everything
And you take it all away again
I know it sounds crazy
But I'll still be waiting
Even though I'll never win
You're so unpredictable
I don't know if you're hot or cold
A curse or a blessing
Girl keep me guessing
'Cause I don't even want to know
'Cause I'm twisted and I'm tortured over you

Yeah yeah

You're letting me in, you're locking me out
You're building me up, you're knocking me down
You're beautifully flawed
And that's what I love about you

Baby you're holding my hand
You're leading me on
I'm in over my head
My sanity's gone
You're beautifully flawed
And that's what I hate about you
And that's what I love about you

You you you
You're beautifully flawed
And that's what I hate about you
But that's what I love about you

Even if I had a month
Even if I had a day
I still wouldn't get it
Girl I admit it
I wouldn't ever want to change

Oh
You're letting me in, you're locking me out
You're building me up, you're knocking me down
You're beautifully flawed
And that's what I love about you
That's what I love about you

Baby you're holding my hand
You're leading me on
I'm in over my head
My sanity's gone
You're beautifully flawed
And that's what I hate about you
And that's what I
And that's what I love about you

You you you

You're beautifully flawed
And that's what I hate about you
And that's what I love about you
