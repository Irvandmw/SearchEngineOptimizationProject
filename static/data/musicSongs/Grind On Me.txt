Lyrics:


(It's so thick, you know this)

I'm high as fuck
Light that dutch
Mocking when I'm walking
Ya, they bite that much
And they stalking my circumference, make your pipe stand up
Like a mic I adjust it I don't hide that stuff
Niggas in the kitchen with that white, doing bumps
I do not need that in my life I do not light that stuff
(oh shit!)
So I pick up where I left of yes I still go hard
This the payback to them bitches who can't write there own bars
Imma go far, might be on mars
Preference is on Pluto where I sight see all the stars
I'm high lit smoking violet
My wallets on a diet
Serve em' [?] leather sinch body I'm a goddess
Walking through the crowds
Like I am Isis
I should do it now I should try this
I kind of recognize this
Holy Shit niggas in the back...
