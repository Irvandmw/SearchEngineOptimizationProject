Lyrics:


To be loved is a thrilling sensation as thrilling as can be
Though it happens in every nation they greet if differently
Every mademoiselle with pasoolala, every Englishman talks to his pater
Every spittin' Venetian goes tra la la and the Irish say Mother McCree
But when I look at you and I thrill like I do there is only one thing I can say

Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!
Oh boy what a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy
To know that you love me by heaven above me
I never expected to pick you off the vine
(The others will try and try and try and try and try
To give you the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye)
But when they approach you I'll keep them in line
By telling them oh boy oh boy oh boy you're mine

Certain characters hi-diddle-diddle when cupid comes along
Some mechanics shift gears in the middle and drummers kick the gong
Every cowboy I know hollers yipee-a-ay
Every clown in the circus goes oopla
Every sailor in port hollers anchors aweigh
And an Indian gives you a ugg!
But when you hold me tight like you're doing tonight
There's only one thing I can say

Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!
Oh boy what a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy
To know that you love me by heaven above me
I never expected to pick you off the vine
(The others will try and try and try and try and try
To give you the eye , the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye)
But when they approach you I'll keep them in line
By telling them oh boy oh boy oh boy
Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy you're mine
