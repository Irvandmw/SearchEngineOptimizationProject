Lyrics:


Spring was never waiting for us, boy, 
it ran one step ahead as we followed in the dance.
Between the parted pages that were pressed,
A love hot fevered like a striped pair of pants.

MacArthur Park is melting through the park, 
all the sweet, green icing flowing down.
Someone left the cake out in the rain,
And I don't think that I can take it, 
'cause it took so long to bake it,
And I'll never find that recipe again, oh no!

I recall the yellow cotton dress flowing like a wave
On the ground around your knees
And birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

MacArthur Park is melting through the park, 
all the sweet, green icing flowing down.
Someone left the cake out in the rain,
And I don't think that I can take it, 
'cause it took so long to bake it,
And I'll never find that recipe again, oh no!

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
And there will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
For after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
But I'll have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
But after all the loves of my life
after all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why

MacArthur Park is melting through the park, 
all the sweet, green icing flowing down.
Someone left my cake out in the rain,
And I don't think that I can take it, 
'cause it took so long to bake it,
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh no!
