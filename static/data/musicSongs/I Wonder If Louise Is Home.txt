Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I walk along through the street of the city
There's crowds of people there but I'm on my own
The night is warm and the girls look so pretty
I wonder if Louise is home

I wonder if Louise is home this evening
I wonder if Louise is home
I wonder should I call her up
Or walk over there
I wonder if Louise is home

Stop a while at the light at the corner
Try to picture if she still looks the same
Years are gone and the two of us are older
I wonder if she knows my name

I wonder if Louise is home this evening
I wonder if Louise is home
I wonder should I call her up
Or walk over there
I wonder if Louise is home

It's been a long, long time
To tell the truth, well I'm
Not certain that I know her anymore
But that's not true you see
Why should she notice me
She never noticed me before

I wonder if Louise is home this evening
I wonder if Louise is home
I wonder should I call her up
Or walk over there
I wonder if Louise is home
I wonder if Louise is home
I wonder if Louise is home
I wonder if Louise is home
I wonder if Louise is home
