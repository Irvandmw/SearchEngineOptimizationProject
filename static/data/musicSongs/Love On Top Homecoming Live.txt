Lyrics:


I wanna sing this last song to all of my incredible, beautiful fans
Loyal fans, ride-or-dies
This dedicated to my incredible B-hive

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
And I can feel the stars whenever you're near
You're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

Every body asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh-oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
But finally you put me first
Sing it y'all

Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, it's your turn
Sing it
Louder
You're the (One I need)
C-c-come on baby, it's (You)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can (Always call)
When I need you, make everything (Stop)
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
C-c-come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top

Coachella, thank you so much, I love you
