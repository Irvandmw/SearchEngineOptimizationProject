Lyrics:


I've been asking some people
If they remember the girl, if they've forgotten, round as a cotton
A dress, have you seen her, if she's much leaner
Yes she is missing is true

She has gone out there somewhere
Disappeared into thin air
I would just like to find her
I would like to remind her - the good times we had there
More than just good friends
Yes she is missing is true

I've been asking around, and what I have found
she moved on farther this time
I've been checking it out, there ain't no doubt,
the woman that used to be mine

She is a missing person
She's hiding away it would seem
She is a missing person
She so much lighter

She is a missing person
She is got a good write up
She so much tighter

Missing person
She is hiding away from me

She up and she left, now she is gone
She didn't even me a
Didn't write me note
Send me no line it's a pity

She is a missing person
Where are you
Missing person
Where are you

Missing person
Hiding away
Missing person
Hiding away
Missing Person
Missing person
Missing Person
Missing Person
