Lyrics:


Yeah, yeah, yeah!

We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
And what we want, we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here
'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say, "I wanna die before I'm old"
But because of you I might think twice

Yeah, yeah, yeah! [x2]

Alright. Second verse

What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
Don't wanna know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep

I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here
'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

But I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say, "I wanna die before I'm old"
But because of you I might think twice

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say, "I wanna die before I'm old"
But because of you I might think twice

Yeah, yeah, yeah! oh!

Yeah, yeah, yeah![x2]

Ohhohhoh yeah, yeah, yeah! [x8]
