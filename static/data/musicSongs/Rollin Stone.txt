Lyrics:


Come home rollin' stone,  
Home where you belong (belong, Oh! come...) 
Oh! come home rollin' stone,  
You've been away too long! 

I wandered into Kansas a-singin' a song 
Singin' doodle-doo-day, all day! 
And then I got a feelin' that somethin' was wrong 
When a voice in my heart seemed to say... 

Come home rollin' stone,  
Home where you belong, belong, 
Oh! come home rollin' stone,  
You've been away too long! 

I left my love a-weepin' in old Arkansas 
Left her for the freight cars that passed 
But last night in a tavern, I swear that I saw 

Her face in a shimmering glass... 

(Come home rollin' stone,  
Home where you belong, belong, 
Oh! come home rollin' stone,  
You've been away too long...) 

Now, when I hear that lonesome old train comin' near 
And the moon is over the track 
Oh somewhere from the shadows I know that I'll hear 
Her voice in the clickity clack! 

Oh come home rollin' stone,  
Home where you belong, belong, 
Oh! come home rollin' stone,  
You've been away too long...(Come home...)
