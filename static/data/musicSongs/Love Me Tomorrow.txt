Lyrics:


She said, "It's lonely here tonight." She's always sad when she's alone.
She said, "I need you here tonight." She couldn't wait 'til I get home.
She loves me, and that's all I need to know.
She's part of my life; just a part I won't let go.
Then she said,

"Love me tomorrow. Won't you please promise me? Love me tomorrow like today.
Love me tomorrow; hurry back. Can't you see I need you much more than yesterday?"

You know it's always cold at night; it's always lonely 'til the dawn.
And though it's not what we both want, knowing she's there, I'll carry on.
Because she loves me, and that's all I need to know.
She's part of my life; just a part I won't let go.
Then she said,

"Love me tomorrow. Won't you please promise me? Love me tomorrow like today.
Love me tomorrow; hurry back. Can't you see I need you more than any words can say?"

She loves me, and that's all I need to know.
She's part of my life; just a part I won't let go.
Then she said,

"Love me tomorrow. Won't you please promise me? Love me tomorrow like today.
Love me tomorrow; hurry back. Can't you see I need you much more than yesterday?"

Love me tomorrow; love me tomorrow like today.
Love me tomorrow; I need you much more than yesterday.
