Lyrics:


I don't know how to love him,
What to do, how to move him.
I've been changed, yes, really changed.
In these past few days when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else.

I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man, he's just a man.
And I've known so many men before
In very many ways: he's just one more

Should I bring him down? 
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love?
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this.
What's it all about?

Don't you think it's kind of funny
I should be in this position?
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show: he scares me so.

Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost, I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, no, I just couldn't cope.
So I'd turn my head, I'd back away,
I wouldn't want him to know: he scares me so.
I need him so, I want him so, I love him so.
