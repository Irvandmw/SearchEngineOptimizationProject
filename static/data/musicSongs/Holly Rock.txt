Rock, rock, holly rock
Everybody wanna holly rock
Rock, rock, holly rock
Everybody wanna holly rock
Say it
(Rock, rock, holly rock
Everybody wanna holly rock
Rock, rock, holly rock
Everybody wanna holly rock)
Somebody

There's a way to say it, good god
Hit me again now
Come on over, baby, and dig the pop
A funky little thing called holly rock
It might be a dance, it might be a song
It might have you rockin', baby, all night long
Anybody want the holly rock?
Take a little pick, you just can't stop
It's bad, good god
Care for you to turn me out
And all you little birds, gather 'round
I'm gonna show you what the holly rock's about

(Holly rock)
(Holly rock)
(Holly rock) Good god
(Holly rock) Uh-huh

Sheila E's my name, holly rock's my game
I'm funky as I wanna be
Lyin' up a hundred, I swear to God
I'm rockin' 'til you just can't see
Mass appeal, a little girl's smile
I make you happy, baby, all the while
'Cause I'm bad, good god
And if you got a big enough stick
Come on over, baby, to the holly rock
Don't you wanna learn a new trick?

(Holly rock)
(Holly rock) Lord
(Holly rock) Good god
(Holly rock) Somebody

Rock, rock, holly rock
Everybody wanna holly rock, say it
(Rock, rock, holly rock
Everybody wanna holly rock)
Rock, rock, holly rock
Everybody wanna holly rock, you say it
(Rock, rock, holly rock
Everybody wanna holly rock)
Look it here

Sheila E's my name, holly rock's my game
I'm funky as I wanna be
Lyin' up a hundred, I swear to God
I'm rock 'em 'til they just can't see
'Cause I'm bad, good god
Funkier than the wicked witch
I'll pet your kitten, your little dog too
Don't you wanna be my bitch?

(Holly rock)
(Holly rock) Uh-huh, lord
