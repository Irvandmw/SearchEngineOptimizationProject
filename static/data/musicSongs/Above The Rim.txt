Lyrics:


[DaBaby:]
Dunkin' on niggas, above the rim
My numbers be cheap, my plug out in Cali
Sent him an addy, he flew 'em in
When I hit your bitch from the back, she say daddy
I'm bending her over and choking on her
Spreading her legs and I'm stroking on her
I'm talking that shit and she talk it back
I pull out and bust it out wide open on her

I got out the house around 7:30
Smoke me a blunt and got something to eat
She told me her nigga was 9 to 5
So I come to fuck her from 12 to 3
She told me her nigga a peewee
I be on your couch, watching TV
Yo lil bitch, my name is Mimi
You threw me an ally like CP

Dunkin' on niggas, above the rim
My numbers be cheap, my plug out in Cali
Sent him an addy, he flew 'em in
When I hit your bitch from the back, she say daddy
I'm bending her over and choking on her
Spreading her legs and I'm stroking on her
I'm talking that shit and she talk it back
I pull out and bust it out wide open on her

Thought she was scared of me, thought she was amateur
She put that head on me
I'm not really famous, but bitches be sucking me like a celebrity
I know she a freak, I'm tryna, drive she told let back the seat
Had the ball in her hand with the tongue out, like Jordan 1993

Dunkin' on niggas, above the rim
My numbers be cheap, my plug out in Cali
Sent him an addy, he flew 'em in
When I hit your bitch from the back, she say daddy
I'm bending her over and choking on her
Spreading her legs and I'm stroking on her
I'm talking that shit and she talk it back
I pull out and bust it out wide open on her

[Money Man:]
I feel like Pac, I ball above the rim
My niggas shooting, and I don't need a gym
I just took fifty K I made from streaming and started to grow with all these bells and whistle
These niggas be hating, but they ain't got a nickel
I'm rocking black and white, I'm too official
My bitch, she be thick as fuck and superficial
The way she give mouth, she should've been a dentist
Got thirty piece in the car a nigga rented
These niggas be scary, I could see them shiver
Just send me the addy, the package get delivered
He tried to run off, I shot him in the liver
I fuck her like I just got up outta prison
My ticket so low, these niggas don't believe it
She stroking my dick and swallowing my semen
My chopper rip pussy niggas up to pieces
DaBaby just hit me and said he need a bale, yeah
We gon' need a bigger scale, yeah
Balling like Sebastian, Telfair
Ups it, I'ma send it in the morning
Damn I feel like Jordan
Bitch I'm always scoring
Trappin' while I'm touring
Serving out a foreign
Damn she wet as fuck
She raining and she pouring
Shout out Jay-Z, I just sold a P up at the 40/40

[DaBaby:]
Dunkin' on niggas, above the rim
My numbers be cheap, my plug out in Cali
Sent him an addy, he flew 'em in
When I hit your bitch from the back, she say daddy
I'm bending her over and choking on her
Spreading her legs and I'm stroking on her
I'm talking that shit and she talk it back
I pull out and bust it out wide open on her
Dunkin' on niggas, above the rim
My numbers be cheap, my plug out in Cali
Sent him an addy, he flew 'em in
When I hit your bitch from the back, she say daddy
I'm bending her over and choking on her
Spreading her legs and I'm stroking on her
I'm talking that shit and she talk it back
I pull out and bust it out wide open on her
