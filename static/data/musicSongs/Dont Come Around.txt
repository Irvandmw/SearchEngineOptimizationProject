Lyrics:


Don't come around, what the hell?
You want me to wish you will
I don't think I wish you well
I'm still angry, can't you tell?
We're still acting innocent
We both know that's not your style
Assassinate me with a smile again

All, all that you want
Is someone to blame it on
If all you want
Is someone to say that you were never wrong

Don't come around here, don't come around
When you're asking how am I doing now
Kick me when I'm down
Let's sing it loud, let's shout it out
It's over now

What was ours ain't yours and mine
Someone had to draw the line
It hurts me every now and then
Thought that I was doing fine
Why you here, who let you in?
Why you asking how I've been?
You know that I don't need your sympathy

All, all that you want
Is someone to blame it on
If all you want
Is someone to say that you were never wrong

Don't come around here, don't come around
When you're asking how am I doing now
Kick me when I'm down
Let's sing it loud, let's shout it out
It's over now

Don't come around
Don't come around

Don't come around here, don't come around
When you're asking how am I doing now
Don't come around here, don't come around
When you're asking how am I doing now
Kick me when I'm down
Let's sing it loud, let's shout it out
It's over now
