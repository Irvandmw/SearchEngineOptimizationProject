Lyrics:


[Hook]
I turned on her favorite song
I knew that would turn you on
Now she sayin she gon do what I want
She say she wana wake up with me in the mornin'

She took two shots of Patronnnn
Shots of Patronnnn
Shots of Patronnnnnnnnn
Now she gone and you knowin that it's onn
But this the type of love that just last for the moment...

[Verse 1]
She be super freaky everytime she see the cash come out
Had to stash the gat 
Every vehicle gon have a spot
Twenty sixes got me floatin like a astronaut
lookin at my watch I don't want the hand to pass the dot
money got to be the only thing I'm runnin by
chasin at a lot but I'm fast so I ain't runnin out
picture perfect girl it's time two get yo camera out
you can see the D in HD like the magnavox, baby doll 
Swear to y'all that I got sexy tho
If I pull a stack and it don't turn you on jus lemme kno
lemme know while I turn the deck to numba four
couple numbers mo you gon be ready go 
my destiny is to keep two chicks next to me like Kelly
I mean that chick from H-Town that had that head with Nelly
candy paint slick as the new bottle of KY Jelly
I'm lookin for another jam that I can play like Felly
It seems like your ready to figure out a maneuver
It seems like I'm ready to figure out somethin newer
I betcha you love how I do ya I show her plus I'm approve her
I'm tryna do somethin to do her like I don't need no approval
you a hot girl if not girl don't be touchin my gwock girl
Every female squirrel tryna get a nutt in my world
and this is my world so sit back and relax
and let the four fifteens soothe yo back back bm such a mack

[Hook]
I turned on her favorite song
I knew that would turn you on
Now she sayin she gon do what I want
She say she wana wake up with me in the mornin'

She took two shots of Patronnnn
Shots of Patronnnn
Shots of Patronnnnnnnnn
Now she gone and you knowin that it's onn
But this the type of love that just last for the moment...

[Verse 2]
She checkin out my whip, she checkin in the W
Checkin out a flick and she jammin that because of you
checkin to see if our man thats gona get you in trouble whoo
I show you some love but I love if you cumber too
cumber too when you know yo boy got cha
parmesean pasta pourin on hot stuff
Tellin me how his D game trash like oscar
knowin that my D gona put her to sleep like boxer
Sugar ray hook a lay right below yo belt
M&M's is known to melt you cant even control yourself
lookin round grabbin pillows reachin for some help
I could never lay my D down it's gon break the scale
yeah playboy bunny got me energized
Energized I ain't gona need many tries
But I bet you gon reach the clouds many times
climax then I go back to gettin money right.....

[Final hook]
I turned on her favorite song
I knew that would turn you on
Now she sayin she gon do what I want
She say she wana wake up with me in the mornin'

She took two shots of Patronnnn
Shots of Patronnnn
Shots of Patronnnnnnnnn
Now she gone and you knowin that it's onn
But this the type of love that just last for the moment...
