Lyrics:


It's a kind of magic.
It's a kind of magic.
A kind of magic.

One dream, one soul,
One prize, one goal.
One golden glance of what should be.

It's a kind of magic.

One shaft of light that shows the way.
No mortal man can win this day.

It's a kind of magic.

The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time.

It's a kind of magic.

The waiting seems eternity.
The day will dawn of sanity.

Is this a kind of magic?
(It's a kind of magic.)
There can be only one.
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done.

This flame that burns inside of me.
I'm hearing secret harmonies.

It's a kind of magic.

The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time.

It's a kind of magic.
It's a kind of magic.

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon beâ
Will soon beâ
Will soon be done.

This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic.
There can be only one.
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done. (Done.)

Magic.
It's a kind of magic.
It's a kind of magic, magic, magic, magic, magic.

It's magic.

It's a kind of magic.
