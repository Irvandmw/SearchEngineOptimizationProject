Lyrics:


I could turn my life from a good dream
To living in a nightmare, ruining a good thing
Probably couldn't tell you how I got here
Bottom of the barrel, I been hanging here a lot
I've always done what I want
Just give me one more chance to mess it up

I got pain in my mind and heart
I can never stop it once it starts
Something in the way, I could pull our charge
But only ever hurt myself

I got, I got problems
I got, I got problems

I know, I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
When I do, I put a scratch on the silver lining
If I'm being honest, I've been lying
I wanna tell the truth 'cause I'm sick of what I'm hiding
I've always done what I want
I know, I've done my share of messing up

I got, I got problems
I got, I got problems
I'm sorry for the times I trip and I fall
You blame yourself, but it isn't you fault then
I got, I got problems

I got pain in my mind and heart
I can never stop it once it starts
Something in the way, I could pull our charge
But only ever hurt myself

I got, I got problems
I got, I got problems
I'm sorry for the times I trip and I fall
You blame yourself, but it isn't you fault then
I got, I got problems

I got problems
