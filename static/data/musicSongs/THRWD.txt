Lyrics:


Cause I'm tight, cause I'm tight
Tighter than American Apparel
I mean

Yo! I'm a monkey
I'm a unicorn and your bitch
She trying to touch my dick

Your rap game weak, said "I'm rap game me"
Now who the fuck gonna stop a girl, I'm kickstand free
And they ask me, "where them ratchets?" I say "that ain't me"
But you know that I've been down for all that ass, blame these
Silly hoes, mad booty when they clap, rain G
And I'm sippin' you know what gave me mad brain freeze
Hot pink, blunted, burning, British bitch, I'm nothing [?]
So they climbing, yeah they climbing
Give a bitch a boost, Yeah I'm tippin' on this juice
Mama hop up out the Nissan, sit up in them twenty-twos
See these Micky niggas fake when your kitty ain't the same
See I be up in your city, mind flooded and I'm sank
I'm a shark without a tank, think I'm starving with some bait
And I love it when they hate [3x]
Yeah I love it when they hate
Said "I love it when they hate"
Yeah I love it when they hate
Yeah!

I'm gone, might be on
Where's the Visine
I'm mean, en garde
Baby I'm throwed, I'm throwed
I can tell you throwed [2x]
I can tell you throwed
I'm gone, might be on
Where's the Visine
I'm mean, en garde
I'm throwed, baby I'm throwed
I could tell you throwed [4x]
I could tell you
I-I could tell you throwed
Where's the Visine?
I mean En Garde
I'm throwed, baby I'm throwed
Baby I'm throwed
I'm throwed [5x]
I'm gone, might be on
Yeah!
