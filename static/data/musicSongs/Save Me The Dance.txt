Lyrics:


Save me the dance  
where the lights go down low 
save me the one they call  
the dance of "love"!  

When the room is dark,  
every heart's aglow 
save me the dance of love  
an' never ever let me go! 

It's our private song  
and our private band  
and when the dance is through  

forever ever hold my hand! 

Save me the dance  
where the lights go down low 
save me the one they call  
the dance of "love"!  

[Italian lyrics]

[Chorus x3]
