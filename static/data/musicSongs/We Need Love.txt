Lyrics:


Too many brothers falling
Too many mothers cry
Too many prayers are bounced back from the sky
Too much talk and too much cheat
Too many fathers losing sleep
Too many broken hearts we can't make right

We need love, love, love
We got to fight for, we got to fight for
Love, love, love
We've got a right to, we've got a right to
Love, love, love
Is the only thing
There just ain't enough of
There just ain't enough of

Too many bridges burning
Too many battle lines
Too many wounded dreamers left behind
Too much time spent building walls
Was what we found worth what we lost?
Too many pages that we can't rewrite

We need love, love, love
We got to fight for, we got to fight for
Love, love, love
We've got a right to, we've got a right to
Love, love, love
Is the only thing
There just ain't enough of
There just ain't enough of

(All we need, all we need is a little love)
(All we need, all we need is a little love)
All we need is a little love
(All we need, all we need is a little love)
(We need love, love, love, a little love)
All we need is love, yeah

Too much talk and too much cheat
(All we need, all we need is a little love)
Too many fathers losing sleep
Too many broken hearts we can't make right
(All we need, all we need is a little love)

Oh we need love, love, love
Is the only thing
There just ain't enough of
