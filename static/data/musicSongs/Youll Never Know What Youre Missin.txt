Lyrics:


Have you ever wanted to steal a kiss
Have you ever wanted to try
But you let her get you scared to death
And got you so mad you could cry
Well I'm sorry for you
But I really don't know why
'Cause you'll never know what you're missin' til you try
'Til You try

Have you ever wanted to hold her tight
But you couldn't get up the nerve
So you waited untill she had to go
And got just what you deserved
Did she smile at you
And you never did no why
Well you'll never know what you're missin' til you try
'Til you try

You'll never know what you're missin' til you try
'Til you try
You'll never know what you're missin', that's no lie
That's no lie

So you'd better listen to what I say
If you want some kissin' tonight
Go ahead and hold her close to you
And kiss her with all of your might
You better give her the word
Before she leaves you high and dry
'Cause you'll never know what you're missin' til you try
'Til you try

Well you'll never know what you're missin' til you try
'Til you try
You'll never know what you're missin' and that's no lie
That's no lie

So you'd better listen to what I say
If you want some kissin' tonight
Go ahead and hold her close to you
And kiss her with all of your might
You better give her the word
Before she leaves you high and dry
Because you'll never know what you're missin' til you try
'Til you try
'Cause you'll never know what you're missin' til you try
'Til you try
