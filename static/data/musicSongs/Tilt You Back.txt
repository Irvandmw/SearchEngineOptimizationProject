Lyrics:


I saw two faces in the light, of a dead end street
Begged them for a smoke and we started to speak
Counting bricks in the wall, and my voice cracks
I said "You see I've got this boy, and he don't love me back"

So we walked for a bit, and Jesse grabs me hard
He said "Come back down to earth from where ever you are"
But his words don't register, I'm lost in your eyes
And this dial tone will kill me by the end of night

Come on and wrap me up, let me tilt you back and spin
I want your taste on my tongue, won't you warm my bones within?
Reveal yourself to me, on this dark and empty street
You can feel yourself in me, swallow you down so easily

Now it's getting kind of late, so I thank them for their time
Trip over sidewalk blocks and slurred words, that I know aren't even mine
Jack's a better friend than Jesse cause he puts the pain to ease
Though I know I'll be alone tonight despite how much I bleed

Come on and wrap me up, let me tilt you back and spin
I want your taste on my tongue, won't you warm my bones within?
Reveal yourself to me, on this dark and empty street
You can feel yourself in me, swallow you down so easily

Half closed eyes and my shoes untied, know I'll be falling asleep in my Levi's tonight
Jack's a lonely friend, despite what I intend, know I'll be waking up to messages I couldn't send

Come on and wrap me up, let me tilt you back and spin
I want your taste on my tongue, won't you warm my bones within?
Reveal yourself to me, on this dark and empty street

You can feel yourself in me, swallow you down so easily
Reveal yourself to me, on this dark and empty street
You can feel yourself in me, swallow you down so easily
