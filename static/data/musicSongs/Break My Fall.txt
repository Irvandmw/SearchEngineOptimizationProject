Lyrics:


The greatest line in history
Baby itâs not you, itâs me
What you think Iâm dumb, dumb babydoll
Iâm big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Stop right there
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you really care

Donât go and blow it all, itâs bad enough baby
I donât wanna hear you saying itâs not you, itâs me
If thereâs blood on my hands, you should let me know
If youâre done with a dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby you said it all,
Thereâs nothing you can say to break my fall

Greatest lie in history,
Baby itâs not you, itâs me
Do you really think Iâll buy your bullshit boy
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You havenât gone and hurt me yet
But you know that Iâll crumble if you call

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Stop right there
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you really care

Donât go and blow it all, itâs bad enough baby
I donât wanna hear you saying itâs not you, itâs me
If Thereâs blood on my hands, you should let me know
If youâre done with a dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby you said it all,
Thereâs nothing you can say to break my fall

Break my fall

Iâm not gonna let you become a martyr
Iâm not gonna let you pickup the gun
Iâm gonna make this, a whole lot harder
Wonât make it easy for you to run
Iâm not gonna let you become a martyr
Iâm not gonna let you pickup the gun
Iâm gonna make this, a whole lot harder
Wonât make it easy for you to run

Donât go and blow it all, itâs bad enough baby
I donât wanna hear you saying itâs not you, itâs me
If thereâs blood on my hands, you should let me know
If youâre done with a dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby you said it all,
Thereâs nothing you can say to break my fall

Donât go and blow it all, itâs bad enough baby
I donât wanna hear you saying itâs not you, itâs me
If thereâs blood on my hands, you should let me know
If youâre done with a dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby you said it all,
Thereâs nothing you can say to break my fall
