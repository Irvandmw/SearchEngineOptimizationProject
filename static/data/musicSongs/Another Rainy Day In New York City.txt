Lyrics:


Another rainy day in New York City
Softly sweet, so silently it falls
As cross town traffic crawls
Memories in my way in New York City
Tender, tough, too tragic to be true
And nothing I can do
City workers cheer
The taxis disappear
Another rainy day in New York City
Another spacey stay in New York city
High up in an overpriced hotel
The view is really swell
Windy, wet and gray in New York City
No one here I really want to see
Old friends and family
So suddenly serene
The air is fresh and clean
Another rainy day in New York City
