Lyrics:


It doesn't matter if you go or you stay
It doesn't matter at all
I've made my mind up that I'm goin' away
And there's no use cryin'
No use tellin' me you're sorry now
It doesn't matter anymore
I know I took you back before
But I'm all through forgivin' you

There must be someone who is gentle and kind
There must be someone who's true
And that's the kind of girl I'm gonna find
And there's no use cryin'
No use tellin' me how much you've changed
It doesn't matter anymore
I know I took you back before
But I'm all through forgivin' you

And there's no use cryin'
No use tellin' me how much you've changed
It doesn't matter anymore
I know I took you back before
But I'm all through forgivin' you

I'm gonna find a love that's true
I'm all through forgivin' you
I'm gonna find a love that's true
