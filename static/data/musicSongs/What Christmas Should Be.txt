Lyrics:


What wishes will you make
When the season is near
Will your dreams be the same
As they were last year

Will you ask for a little 
Will you ask for a lot
And when you make your list
Will there be something you forgot

How about peace on earth
It can't be bought or sold
How about peace this Christmas
And someones hand to hold
How about love in our hearts 
And hope for you and me
How about peace on earth
That's what Christmas should be

Will you get all the things
That you've been waiting for
Snowfall and presents
Choire singing at your door

This season will be perfect
Like those picture postcards seem
But is that the anwser
Is that what Christmas really means

How about peace on earth
It can't be bought or sold
How about peace this Christmas
And someones hand to hold
How about love in our hearts 
And hope for you and me
How about peace on earth
That's what Christmas should be

What would you sacrifice
What would you give away
For the greatest gift of all
On Christmas day

How about peace on earth
It can't be bought or sold
How about peace this Christmas
And someones hand to hold
How about love in our hearts 
And hope for you and me
How about peace on earth

How about peace on earth
It can't be bought or sold
How about peace this Christmas
And someones hand to hold
How about love in our hearts 
And hope for you and me
How about peace on earth
How about peace on earth
That's what Christmas should be

Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
