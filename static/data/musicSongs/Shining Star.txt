Lyrics:


She was a bad girl, he was a good boy
She played with fire while he played inside the ring
She gets so selfish and he was selfless
He played by books, she never liked to play it safe

But he fell in love with her fucked up ways
With her drunken days, yeah, he still stayed
Yeah he fell in love with her twisted dreams
And all in between, and he'd still sing

Baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are
Baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are

Head underwater, no one could save her
She played with death, she held her breath, she liked the pain
Her world was crumbling, but she did nothing
She'd numb herself so she would never feel a thing

But he fell in love with her fucked up ways
With her drunken days, yeah, he still stayed
Yeah he fell in love with her twisted dreams
And all in between, and he'd still sing

Baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are
Baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are

You know you'll always be my baby, don't cry
You know you're crazy, doesn't phase me, don't lie
'Cause baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are
