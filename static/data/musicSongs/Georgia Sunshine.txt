Lyrics:


Oh how I miss that Georgia sunshine oh how I wish that I was there
Yeah to wake up every morning to the smell of them Georgia pines
Each blossom's blooming everywhere

My restless young heart to be wandering
Far from that old hometown of mine
Oh how I long every minute that I've been gone
To get myself back home to that Georgia sunshine

I wander ground town to town ain't many places I ain't go
But the road I see it keeps calling me
It's the road that take this Georgia boy back home

Oh how I miss that Georgia sunshine oh how I wish that I was there...
My restless young heart to be wandering...
