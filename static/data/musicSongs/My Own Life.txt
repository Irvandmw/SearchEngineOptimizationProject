Lyrics:


Can you feel it?
Essence weak in this room
Designing all the paintings on the wall
And its the right
That sets me in despair
It's ornamental
When I beg for you

So, you want it that way?
Don't you talk, just listen
I wait for this to be over
So I'll start!

It doesn't show
And we're not well behaved
Its always there when you're not expecting it
So you complain
You legs are tired
Sit in my chair
Don't fall through it

So, you want it that way?
Don't you talk, just listen
I wait for this to be over,
So I'll..
