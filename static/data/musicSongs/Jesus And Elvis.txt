Lyrics:


Jesus and Elvis, painted on velvet
Hanging at the bar here every night
It's good to be back again, oh me and my old friends
Neath the neon cross and a string of Christmas lights

Lola built this joint in sixty-seven
And her boy went out to fight on Christmas eve
In a war nobody won, she lost her only son
Now everything he loved is what you see

Jesus and Elvis, painted on velvet
Hanging at the bar here every night
It's good to be back again, oh me and my old friends
Neath the neon cross and a string of Christmas lights

Mama told them Jesus loves a sinner
His daddy said that music saved his soul
Between the drunkards and the band
It's a fitting promised land
For the king of kings and the king of rock and roll

Jesus and Elvis, painted on velvet
Hanging at the bar here every night
It's good to be back again, oh me and my old friends
Neath the neon cross and a string of Christmas lights

So if you need a shot of whiskey and redemption
Where the delta meets the sea of Galilee
Get washed in the blood of the Mississippi mud
Come all you non-believers and you'll see

Jesus and Elvis, painted on velvet
Hanging at the bar here every night
It's good to be back again, oh me and my old friends
Neath the neon cross and a string of Christmas lights

By and by, Lord, by and by
