Lyrics:


Walking through life without clouds above me, 
I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Lost in the crowd
Never felt so lonely and
I really living and
Barely holding onto a dream of what could be.

It only took one taste of your kiss and
Now I know everything that I've missed my heart is beating for the first time.
Anticipating your every touch, 
Intoxicating me with your love
And I'm so so high
And you're the reason why.

Walking on clouds and finally laughing
Never believed that this could happen
You found a place that I never knew existed, 
Two souls embrace with no resistance just in time you've saved my life.

It only took one taste of your kiss and
Now I know everything that I've missed my heart is beating for the first time.
Anticipating your every touch, 
Intoxicating me with your love
And I'm so so high
And you're the reason why.

You're the reason why... 
You're the reason why... 

It only took one taste of your kiss and
Now I know everything that I've missed my heart is beating for the first time.
Anticipating your every touch, 
Intoxicating me with your love
And I'm so so high
And you're the reason why.
