Lyrics:


(With 'Chelle and kick it with Kelly, or holla at B)
(Ya gotta be G's, you way outta your league)

We like them boys up top from the B.K. (B.K.)
I like them boys over there, they lookin' strong tonight (Strong tonight)
(California Love)
We like them boys that be in them 'Lac's leanin' (Leanin')
Open their mouth, they grill gleamin' (Gleamin')
Candy paint, keep that whip clean and, sing it y'all (Clean and)
(They always be talking that country slang we like)

We keep the beat that be in the back beatin' (Beatin')
His eyes be so low from their chiefin' (Chiefin')
I love how he keep my body screaming (Screaming)
A rude boy that's good to me with street credibility

If his status ain't hood
I ain't checking for him
Better be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean

Need some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at?)
They wanna take care of me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at?)
Wouldn't mind taking one for me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at?)
They wanna spend that on me, haha (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at?)
Wouldn't mind puttin' that on me (Where they at?)
Let's go!

I need a soldier

Please give it up for Destiny's Child
Give it up one more time for my best friends
That's my best friend
