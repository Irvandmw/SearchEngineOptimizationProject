Lyrics:


I hear sleigh bells ring
But I haven't heard a word from you in years
I hear sleigh bells ringin'
But I haven't heard a word from you in years
I hear choirs singin'
And I'm just sittin' here cryin' Christmas tears

Everybody's singin' "Merry Christmas"
As they watch the starry sky filled with reindeer
Everybody's singin' "Merry Christmas"
As they watch the starry sky filled with reindeer
I'm smilin' on the outside
But on the inside, I'm cryin' Christmas tears

Well you been gone (you been gone)
For a long long time (you been gone)
But it's Christmas and I can't get you off of my mind
Yes, you been gone (you been gone)
For a hundred years or more (you been gone)
You came back and hang
"Merry Christmas" on my door

I need you baby
To hold me tight
I need ya darling
On this Christmas night
And as I sit and think of those long lonely years
I can't help but cry, oh, Christmas tears
Oh, Christmas tears
