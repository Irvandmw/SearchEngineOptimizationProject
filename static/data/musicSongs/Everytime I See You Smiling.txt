Lyrics:


Everytime I see you smiling
I see a love so real
And everytime I see you smiling
Words can't explain the way I feel

If they made me king with a fortune
And told me that I could rule the world
It would take one thing more to make me happy
That would be your love little girl

Everytime I see you smiling
I see a love so real
And everytime I see you smiling
Words can't explain the way I feel

If they made me king with a fortune
And told me that I could rule the world
It would take one thing more to make me happy
That would be your love little girl
That would be your love little girl
That would be your love little girl
