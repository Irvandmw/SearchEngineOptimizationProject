Hey, Mike, whatâs up?
This is Ron, Riff Raff, just asking you whatâs happening?
I was just touching base, seeing how your Easter went
Um, just seeing if youâre going to see Joe sometime soon, too,
Because heâs got my keyboard that Iâve been trying to get back
Iâve been trying to call him and he hasnât been returning any messages
So Iâm seeing what the best angle is to, you know, get it back
