Lyrics:


Let me tell ya about 6 young fellas
That really know how to get down
Coast to coast, NY to L.A.
Yeah, they run this fucking town

I'm talking about
JC Caylen, Connor, Sam, Ricky, Kian, Trevor Moran
Check yourself before you wreck yourself
'Cause now you're rocking with the whole damn fam
Oh, yeah

That's O2L, but you already know
And if you really don't
You're out the window
And they're never going to keep you feeling lonely
Your only biggest problem is bitch Chloe

Ricky got sass
Sam got love
Trevor got them notes from above
Connor got the giggles
And Kian is a pro
And JC is from Texas!

Tonight we're gonna give them hell
Everybody's screaming O2L
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
O-2-L, yeah
Tonight we're gonna give 'em hell
Everybody's screaming O-2-L
Saying, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
O2L

Everybody go bananas
Everybody go bananas

Here we go again, same ol' thing
Ricky got the tank top with no sleeves
Connor's like, "More Tumblr, please!"
And oh, my God, Kian, can I get your number... please?
Sam Pottorff, what it do?
Trevor's all like "Ah, oh"
Man, I think that's everyone there
And JC's still from Texas
(Yee, haw, am I right?)

Oh, yeah
Got to get em with it, with the program
Yeah, they're seeing rumours
Saying oh, yeah
Got to get 'em with it saying, "Oh, yeah"

Tonight we're gonna give them hell
Everybody's screaming O2L
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
O-2-L, yeah
Tonight we're gonna give them hell
Everybody's screaming O2L
Saying, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
O2L

Everybody go bananas

Tonight we're gonna give them hell
Everybody's screaming, O2L
Hmm, hmm
O-2-L
Tonight we're gonna give them hell
Everybody's screaming, O2L
Saying, hmm, hmm
O-2-L
