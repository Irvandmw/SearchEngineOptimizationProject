Lyrics:


Sometimes I feel discouraged
And take my work in pain
I'm tempted all to [?]
To grubble and complain

But then I think of Jesus
And what He bore for me
Than I cry to the rock of ages
I doubt me

Oh, rock of ages, hide thou me
There is no other refuge
Can save but thee
Through this old world
I've wandered so far, far from thee

Then I cry
To the rock of ages
Hide thou me

Oh, rock of ages, hide thou me
There is no other refuge
Can save but thee
Through this old world
I've wandered so far, far from thee

Then I cry
To the rock of ages
Hide thou me

Oh, rock of ages, hide thou me
There is no other refuge
Can save but thee
Through this old world
I've wandered so far, far from thee

Then I cry
To the rock of ages
Hide thou Me
Hide thou Me
