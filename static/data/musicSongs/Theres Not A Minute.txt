Lyrics:


In the morning when I wake and see your picture
In the afternoon when I meet our old friends
When I sit and have myself a lonely supper
Right up until the blue, blue night ends

There's not a minute that it doesn't hurt me
How could you desert me, break my heart this way
And even when I'm sleeping, you come into my dreams
There's not a minute that it doesn't hurt
There's not a minute that it doesn't hurt

When I see two lovers run to meet each other
When I think of all our dreams that won't come true
When I realize I'll never love another
So many things dear, remind me of you

There's not a minute that it doesn't hurt me
How could you desert me, break my heart this way
And even when I'm sleeping, you come into my dreams
There's not a minute that it doesn't hurt
There's not a minute that it doesn't hurt
