Lyrics:


Everytime I see your face in the midnight
I remind myself I'm just a fool
Just a fool for ever thinkin' we could go on forever
At least we've lived a life or two

Another day goes by and I fall into silence
It was just a dream away
And all the thoughts we shared and the worlds we left behind us
Have more meaning anyway

But it's another day
It's another time
You're so far away
And I'm so hard to find
It's a long way home
It's a long way to freedom on your own

I remember we were so much older then
The more you learn, the less you know
That I've always known
That a friend is just a friend
So now your freedom's all your own

But it's another day
It's another time
You're so far away
And I'm so hard to find
It's a long way home
It's a long way to freedom on your own
