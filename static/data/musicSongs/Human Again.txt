Lyrics:


I donât even recognize when I look into your eyes,
All I can ever see, is trouble hanging over me. 
Trouble , trouble, trouble hanging over me. 
Trouble, trouble, trouble is all I ever see. 

I got a pain in my heart and a pain in my chest, I wanna be human again. 
I got a pain in my head, and Iâm losing my breath, I wanna be human again.
Human Again, Human Again, Human Again, Human Again.
I wanna be human again. 

I can feel it in my bones, I donât wanna die alone. 
When I all ever get is rain, help me see the sun again. 
I can see the change in me,  makes me feel alive again. 

I got a pain in my heart and a pain in my chest, I wanna be human again. 
I got a pain in my head, and Iâm losing my breath, I wanna be human again.
Human Again, Human Again, Human Again, Human Again.
I wanna be human again. 

I keep on fighing and I keep on trying. I know thereâs a light in the dark. 
Open your eyes to the beauty inside of your body, your soul and your heart. 

I wanna feel human, I wanna be human. 
Human again, what a beautiful feeling. 
Human again, Iâm coming alive. 
Human again, I wanna be human, I wanna be human again

I got a pain in my heart and a pain in my chest, I wanna be human again
I got a pain in my head, and Iâm losing my breath, I wanna be human again.
