Lyrics:


There she was behind the counter
When I saw her she took me by surprise
Ten years had passed since our brief encounter
When I got caught with the sun in my eyes

It was a total eclipse of the sun
Total eclipse of the sun

On that hot summer day
She blew me away
In a total eclipse of the sun

I went there to buy a Christmas trinket
I never thought I could find such a face
The way she said goodbye, who would think it
Would haunt me in this holiday place

It was a total eclipse of the sun
Total eclipse of the sun

She rolled back the years
To the pain and the tears
Of that total eclipse of the sun

In that July back in '63
She sent my word crashing down around me
I learned to fear what a woman can do
When she's tired of listening to you

It was a total eclipse of the sun
Total eclipse of the sun

She shot her gun
And watched my blood run
In a total eclipse of the sun

Her makeup was flawless
Her clothes were tailored
She smiled with holiday cheer
Back then I was poor
But now I was rich
And still I stood frozen with fear

It was a total eclipse of the sun
A total eclipse of the sun

That girl burned me twice
Turned me to ice
In a total eclipse of the sun

She invited me to her folks' summer home
And when I got there she told me goodbye
I stayed the next day and she stayed away
While the sun burned a hole in my eye

It was a total eclipse of the sun
A total eclipse of the sun

There was no doubt
I was blacked out
In a total eclipse of the sun

Colorful Christmas lights were blinking
And the snow turned everything white
The minute I saw her I stared thinking
Of that painful sunbeam of light

It was a total eclipse of the sun
A total eclipse of the sun

She was the infliction
Of my crucifixion
In a total eclipse of the sun
A total eclipse of the sun

I remember that day
When they all looked away
From a total eclipse of the sun
