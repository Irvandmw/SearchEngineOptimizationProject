Lyrics:


Bullyoo bullyoo boy have I got news for you
I got a feeling hap-happy feeling this is my lucky day
Don't want to sing the blues no more not when I feel this way
I'm gonna rock it 'cause in my pocket I got a load of green
I want to spread the word around so you'll know what I mean

Bullyoo bullyoo boy have I got news for you
I'm gonna to march march march along the avenue
I'm gonna sing sing sing my lucky song
I'm gonna fly fly fly like little birdies do
Spread your wings and come along

I'm gonna live live live it up along the way
So tell me how how can things go wrong
Hey brother what a hey day this has been my lucky pay day
And my lucky song

Bullyoo bullyoo boy have I got news for you
I'm gonna to march march march along the avenue
I'm gonna sing sing sing my lucky song
I'm gonna fly fly fly like little birdies do
Spread your wings and come along

I'm gonna live live live it up along the way
So tell me how how can things go wrong
Hey brother what a hey day this has been my lucky pay day
And my lucky song
My lucky lucky song
