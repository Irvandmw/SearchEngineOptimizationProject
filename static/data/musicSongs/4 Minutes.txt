Lyrics:


[Timbaland 8x:]
I'm outta time and all I got is 4 minutes
(Fricki fricki)
4 minutes eh

Come on
Breakdown
Come on

[Justin Timberlake:]
Come on
Madonna

[Madonna:]
Come on boy I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll

[Justin:]
Well, don't waste time,
Give me a sign,
Tell me how you wanna roll

[Madonna:]
I want somebody to speed it up for me then take it down slow
There's enough room for both

[Justin:]
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where this at
Are you ready to go? (Are you ready to go?)

[Timbaland:]
Come on

[Madonna and Justin:]
If you want it
You've already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want

If you feel it
It must be real
Just say the word
And I'mma give you what you want

[Madonna:]
Time is waiting

[Justin:]
We only got four minutes to save the world

[Madonna:]
No hesitating
Grab a boy

[Justin:]
Go grab a girl

[Madonna:]
Time is waiting

[Justin:]
We only got four minutes to save the world

[Madonna:]
No hesitating

[Justin:]
We only got four minutes huh four minutes

So keep it up keep it up
Don't be a priâhey!âma donna

[Madonna:]
You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

[Justin:]
That's right
Keep it up keep it up
Don't be a priâhey!âma donna

[Madonna:]
You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention

[Justin:]
And I know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good by the way that you move

[Madonna:]
The road to hell is paved with good intentions

[Justin:]
But if I die tonight at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me how 'bout you?

[Madonna and Justin:]
If you want it
You've already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want

If you feel it
It must be real
Just say the word
And I'mma give you what you want

[Madonna:]
Time is waiting

[Justin:]
We only got four minutes to save the world

[Madonna:]
No hesitating
Grab a boy

[Justin:]
Go grab a girl

[Madonna:]
Time is waiting

[Justin:]
We only got four minutes to save the world

[Madonna:]
No hesitating

[Justin:]
We only got four minutes huh four minutes

So keep it up keep it up
Don't be a priâhey!âma donna

[Madonna:]
You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

[Justin:]
That's right
Keep it up keep it up
Don't be a priâhey!âma donna

[Madonna:]
You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

[Timbaland:]
Breakdown

[Madonna:]
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

[Madonna:]
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

[Timbaland:]
I've only got four minutes to save the world
