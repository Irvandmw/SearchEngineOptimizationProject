Lyrics:


(All of these things I want to be
All of these things I want to be) Lord, I want to be
(All of these things I want to be) to you

I wanna be sun that shines for you every morning
Let me be the moon that shines for you every night, oh
I wanna be there, baby, when the world puts you out
Just lo let you know, baby, everything is all right

I wanna be, I wanna be the sun that shines for you every morning
Honey, let me be the moon that shines for you every night
Oh, I wanna be there, I wanna be there when the world gets you out
Just lo let you know that every doggone thing's all right

(All of these things I want to be
All of these things don't you know I want to be)
Every little thing, I want you to let me be to you, baby
(All of these things I want to be) to you

All of these things, all of these things, all of these things
Oh, all of these things I want to be to you, baby
All of these things, ooh, all of these things
All of these things, oh, let me do it for you, baby

All of these things, all of these things
If I can't be all of these things to you, then just let me be a few
Let me be some of these to you, baby, oh, oh, oh
