Lyrics:


We'll be road trippin' rollin' with the top down, southbound 
Little bikinis and white sand

I can't sleep, gotta leave
The summer sun starting to peek through my window, letting me know
Time's up, it's time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting and a pocket full of cash
Cooler full of beer and a little sun stash
In the back of the car, so relax there ain't a beach to far

We'll be road trippin' rollin' with the top down, southbound 
Little bikinis and white sand (hell yeah)
In a tank top gonna let the guns out, all about rockin' that farmers tan
Got the Chev going 70, all the girls looking heavenly 
but ya, kick back and chill out ahead of me
Getting wild, raising hell, and leaving this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now

No tellin', no tellin'
But them lips taste like watermelon
Got a daiquiri kiss, I count when it hits
Makes you wanna get going there
Wherever that is

We'll be road trippin' rollin' with the top down, southbound 
Little bikinis and white sand 
In a tank top gonna let the guns out, all about rockin' that farmers tan
Got the Chev going 70, all the girls looking heavenly 
but ya, kick back and chill out ahead of me
Getting wild, raising hell, and leaving this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now

There ain't no stopping us now

We'll be road trippin' rollin' with the top down, southbound 
Little bikinis and white sand 
In a tank top gonna let the guns out, all about rockin' that farmers tan
Got the Chev going 70, all the girls looking heavenly 
but ya, kick back and chill out ahead of me
Getting wild, raising hell, and leaving this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now
