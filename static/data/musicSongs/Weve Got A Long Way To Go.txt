Lyrics:


It's alright to take my hand, I'm your brother
Wanna show you one way or another
Come on and walk with me
I wanna make you see that's it's alright
It's alright

It's alright to take a stand, I'm your brother
Don't be afraid, we all belong to each other
I want to make you see that's it's alright
It's alright

Don't let it get ya down
We're gonna change I know
So put your feet on the ground
We got such a long way to go
We got such a long way to go
We got such a long way to go

It's alright to take my hand, I'm your brother
Don't be afraid, we all belong to each other
Come on and walk with me
I wanna make you see that's it's alright
It's alright

Don't let it get ya down
We're gonna change I know
So put your feet on the ground
We got such a long way to go
We got such a long way to go
We got such a long way to go
We got such a long way to go
We got such a long way to go
We got such a long way to go
