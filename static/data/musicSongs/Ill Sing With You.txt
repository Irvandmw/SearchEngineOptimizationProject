Lyrics:


For awhile I 
Never thought I 
Ever smile again
But then I heard that simple song
And told myself to sing along

Suddenly I
Finally see that
Things are not so bad
Because I heard that simple song
And told myself to sing along

And it said when you're feeling blue
Sing a simple song and I'll sing with you
And when you're feeling sad
Know that I'll be true
And I'll sing with you

For awhile I
I never understood
How life could be so hard (so hard)
Then I opened up my heart
And gave myself a brand new start

Then I realized
How beautiful life
Turns out to be
Because when I heard that simple song
I told myself to sing along

And it said when you're feeling blue
Sing a simple song and I'll sing with you
And when you're feeling sad
Know that I'll be true
And I'll sing with you

And it's OK when nothing goes your way
It's OK when it doesn't seem right
It's OK when it all falls down and no one comes around
Cause we'll laugh about it
Yeah we'll laugh about it

And when you're feeling blue
Sing a simple song and I'll sing with you
Whoa-whoa when you're feeling blue
Sing a simple song and I'll sing with you
And when you're feeling sad
Know that I'll be true
And I'll sing with you

Whoa-whoa when you're feeling blue
Sing a simple song and I'll sing with you
Whoa-whoa and when you're feeling sad
Know that I'll be true
And I'll sing with you
