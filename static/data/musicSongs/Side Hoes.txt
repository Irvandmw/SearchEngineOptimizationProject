Lyrics:


Oh yeah
Ayy
Firzt on the track

Baby, you know what you do
I can't get over you, I don't know what it is you do
Let me take you out, show you off to all my side hoes
Show you off to all my side hoes
Show you off to all my side hoes
Show you off to all my side hoes

Snapchat flicks, bad bitch, iced out necklace
I can't help it, I'm watching my shit, gettin' jealous
My bitch look good, I look better, flexin'
Let's post a pic and show it off to all my side hoes
Take you home and let me fuck you with the lights on
I get so faded it's so many things that I'm on
So if I text and say "I love you," that's a typo
Good weed, nice clothes, just me, five hoes
Them other niggas they ain't lit but I'm authentic, baby
I got it lit, she suckin' dick inside my rental, baby
[?] nigga, pretty lady
Have a baby with' ya, we'd have a pretty baby
She got that water in her, I'm gonna swim it later
She got me hypnotized, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, you know what you do
I can't get over you, I don't know what it is you do
Let me take you out, show you off to all my side hoes
Show you off to all my side hoes
Show you off to all my side hoes
Show you off to all my side hoes

Why do all my side hoes think they my hoes?
In the bed with five hoes and my life goes
And she so pretty, fuck her with the lights on
And I'm so faded off the Henny, you know I'm in my zone
So fuck them hoes
Ask about me, got a bunch of hoes
I think somebody snitchin', I don't trust them hoes
They dyin' to know our business, they some sucker hoes
Come ride with' me, let ya turn up on a couple hoes
Turn up on 'em bitches, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bitch, I'm a player and a player don't care
She not in love with me, she in love with the vibe
A real nigga don't mind

Baby, you know what you do
I can't get over you, I don't know what it is you do
Let me take you out, show you off to all my side hoes
Show you off to all my side hoes
Show you off to all my side hoes
Show you off to all my side hoes
