Lyrics:


Take that night train to Memphis
Take that night train to Memphis
And when you arrive at the station
I'll be right there to meet you
I'll be right there to greet you
So don't turn down my invitation

Halleluja, hallelujah
I'll be shoutin' hallelujah all the day
Oh we'll have a jubilee down in Memphis, Tennessee
And we'll shout hallelujah all the day

Take that night train to Memphis
Take that night train to Memphis
Tell that engineer to pull that throttle open
Keep that engine stack a smokin'
I'm not kiddin', I'm not jokin'
I'll soon be with my girl and I'm hopin'

Halleluja, hallelujah
I'll be shoutin' hallelujah all the day
Oh we'll have a jubilee down in Memphis, Tennessee
And we'll shout hallelujah all the day

Take that night train to Memphis
Take that night train to Memphis
And when you arrive at the station
I'll be right there to meet you
I'll be right there to greet you
So don't turn down my invitation

Halleluja, hallelujah
I'll be shoutin' hallelujah all the day
Oh we'll have a jubilee down in Memphis, Tennessee
And we'll shout hallelujah all the day
