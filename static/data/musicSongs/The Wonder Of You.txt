Lyrics:
Lyrics:


When no-one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me love and consolation
You give me hope to carry on

And you're always there to lend a hand
In everything I do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you

And when you smile the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your love to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything

I'll guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you

I'll guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you
