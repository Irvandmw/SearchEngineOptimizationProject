Lyrics:


One day we walked along the sand
One day in early spring...
You held a piper in your hand
To mend it's broken wing
Now, I'll remember many a day
An' many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper's song
An' the shadow of a smile!

The shadow of your smile
When you are gone...
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn...
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are... you are to me!

Our wistful little star
Was far too high...
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I...
Now, when I remember spring,
All the joy that love can bring...
I will be remembering,
The shadow of your smile!

[instrumental break]

Now, when I remember spring,
All the joy that love can bring...
I will be remembering,
The shadow of your smile!
