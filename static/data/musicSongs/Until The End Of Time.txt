Lyrics:


Listen

I woke up this morning
Heard the TV sayin' something
'Bout disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going

There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you girl
And what you give me lets me know
That I'll be alright

'Cause if your love was all I had
In this life
Well that would be enough
Until the end of time
So rest your weary heart
And relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl
Until the end of time

You've got me singing
Everybody sing
Everybody singing

Now if you're ever wondering
About the way I'm feeling
Well baby girl there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessing

Sick and tired of tryna save the world
I just want to spend my time with you girl
And what you're giving me lets me know
That we'll be alright

'Cause if your love was all I had
In this life
Well that would be enough
Until the end of time
So rest your weary heart
And relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl
Until the end of time

You've got me singing
Everybody sing
Everybody singing

This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Break it down one time

'Cause if your love was all I had
In this life
That would be enough
Until the end of time
