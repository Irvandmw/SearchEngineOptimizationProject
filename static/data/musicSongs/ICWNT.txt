Yuh, yuh, yuh

These bitches ain't shit, we fuck 'em together
I change up my hoes like I change up the weather
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
Bought a couple bags, Pucci on splash
Dropped a little cash, that's all that
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot

I can't wife no thot, forty at my spot
Smashed her in my drop, got some crazy top
I done damn near wrecked, off that hoe neck
I got a little better flex, I damn near was obsessed
All that is is a bougie freak, saddity bitch from Laguna Beach
Pussy good and her throat deep
Sucked so long, made her nose bleed
I ain't savin' no slutty, I hit her and her buddy
Bought the freak a little puppy but she ain't nothin' but my cuddy
I can't wife no thot, suck my dick till she see snot, ha
I'm from out the slums, fuck these thotties 'cause I'm hot
Hunnid round drum and I shot it on the spot
Codeine on her tongue 'cause I'm drinkin' syrup a lot
Did a donut out the lot soon as I turned out the parkin' lot
I can't wife no thot, no, I can't wife no thot
I had bought some Cartiers 'cause that mouth there on lock
Gucci sock get Louis top, big chain made her pussy pop
Earring got her lashing out, walkin' round like a rental cop
Checkin' bitches, they be on the Gram
Check her phone, I think she tryna scam
I ain't tryna save these hoes, no thank you, ma'am
I hit that nanny on green green, swallow my cum, no ring ring
Red Ferrari a mean ting, I got a mean ting
Came with her panties, I gave her some lean lean
I gave her the clean clean
She want the molly, I gave her a green bean
She took off her wing wings
I put her inside of the Bentley thing
Fucked up a Maybelline
Maybe she think she more than what she is
Maybe she thinkin' queen
Maybe she think Super gone save her
Maybe she fuckin' 'round with the neighbors

These bitches ain't shit, we fuck 'em together
I change up my hoes like I change up the weather
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
Bought a couple bags, Pucci on splash
Dropped a little cash, that's all that
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
