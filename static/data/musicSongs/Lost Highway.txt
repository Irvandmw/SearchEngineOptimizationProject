Lyrics:


Hey, hey
Hey, hey

In my rear-view mirror
My life is getting clearer
The sunset sighs and slowly disappears

These trinkets once were treasure
Life changes like the weather
You grow up, grow old
Or you hit the road
'Round here

So I drive
Watching white lines passing by
With my plastic dashboard Jesus
Waiting there to greet us

Hey, hey
I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas
There ain't no brakes
On this lost highway
Yeah I've busted loose, I'm letting go
Out on this open road
It's independence day
On this lost highway

Hey, hey
Hey, hey

I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I'm afraid of going back again

So I drive
Years and miles are flying by
And waiting there to greet us
Is my plastic dashboard Jesus

Hey, hey
I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas
There ain't no brakes
On this lost highway
Yeah I've busted loose, I'm letting go
Out on this open road
It's independence day
On this lost highway

Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Oh patron saint of lonely souls
Tell this boy which way to go
Guide the car, you got the keys
Farewell to mediocrity
Kicking off the cruise-control
And turning up the radio
Got just enough religion
And a half tank of gas
Come on, let's go

I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas
There ain't no brakes
On this lost highway
I've busted loose, I'm letting go
When I'm out on this open road
It's independence day
On this lost highway

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
On this lost highway
