Lyrics:


Always Been The Kind Of Girl To Hold It Back,
When You Know That You Want To;
Someone Always Had To Tell You Where It's At;
Now You Know That You Want To.

Somethin' In The Music's Gonna Make You Move.
Now You Know That You Want To;
The Rhythm's Gonna Put The Woman In The Mood,
Now You Definitely Want To.

In The Mood, In The Mood,
In The Groove, In The Mood;
You've Got Yourselves An Attitude.

In The Mood, In The Mood,
In The Groove, In The Mood;
You've Got Yourself An Attitude.
