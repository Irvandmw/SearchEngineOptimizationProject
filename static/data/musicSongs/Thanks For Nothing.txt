Lyrics:


I just want you to know
I'm better off alone
So thank you, thank you
For nothing at all

Always thought my life would be over
If you ever walk out that door
Move scenes with the two of us older
Left there on the cutting room floor

I never thought that
I would be the last to see
The worst thing you could do
Would be the best thing for me

I just want you to know
I'm better off alone
So thank you, thank you
For nothing at all
Don't wanna see your face
Won't answer when you call
So thank you, thank you
For nothing at all

Always looking over my shoulder
Paranoid that you would be gone
February is cold but you are much colder
Thought I needed you but I was wrong

I just want you to know
I'm better off alone
So thank you, thank you
For nothing at all
Don't wanna see your face
Won't answer when you call
So thank you, thank you
For nothing at all

You treated me wrong
I'm happy you're not
So thank you, thank you
For nothing at all
You treated me wrong
I'm happy you're not
So thank you, thank you

I never thought that
I would be the last to see
The worst thing you could do
Would be the best thing for me

I just want you to know
I'm better off alone
So thank you, thank you
For nothing at all
Don't wanna see your face
Won't answer when you call
So thank you, thank you

I just want you to know
I'm better off alone
So thank you, thank you
For nothing at all
Don't wanna see your face
Won't answer when you call
So thank you, thank you
For nothing at all
For nothing at all
