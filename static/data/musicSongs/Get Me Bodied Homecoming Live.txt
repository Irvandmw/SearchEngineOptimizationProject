Lyrics:


Everybody say "hey Mrs. Carter" (Hey Mrs. Carter!)
I'm just checkin', make sure y'all still out there
All the way in the back say, "hey Mrs. Carter"
(Hey Mrs. Carter!)
Okay
To my right, say "hey Mrs. Carter"
(Hey Mrs. Carter!)
To my left, say "hey Mrs. Carter"
(Hey Mrs. Carter!)
Everybody put your hands together like this

Everybody put your hands together
Yeah
Now everybody say
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Even louder, hey, hey, hey, hey
Say "I ain't worried, doin' me tonight", sing
(I ain't worried, doin' me tonight) Louder
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody, sing
(A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody)
While y'all standin' on a wall, sing
(While y'all standin' on a wall)
I'm the one tonight gettin' body
(I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied)
Say, get me bodied, sing
(Get me bodied)
Get me bodied (get me bodied)
You want my body, sing (You want my body)
Get me bodied

Baby, all I want is to let it go
Ain't no worry, no, we can dance all night
Get me bodied
That means come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body

Baby, all I need is to let it be
Ain't no worry, no
Boy, dance with me
Feel my body
That means come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body

I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
Swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Coming for ya, let me work on you
I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standing on a wall
I'm the one tonight getting body
Gettin' body, gettin' body
Gettin' body, gettin' body
You want my body, won't you get my body?
You want my body, won't you get my body?
Yeah
