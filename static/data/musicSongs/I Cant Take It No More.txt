Lyrics:


Hey girl won't you lend me a hand
Talk to me if you can
You don't understand, I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more

Sometimes when I'm feelin' this way
You make it hard to stay away
It's not easy to say, I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more

When you're lost in all your dreams
And it seems so hard to please
And things don't work out the way you planned

Then you look for something new
Someone else to pull you through
Someone to give you a helping hand

Hey girl I hear your leavin' today
I hope you find what you need someway
There's nothing to say, I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more

When you're lost in all your dreams
And it seems so hard to please
And things don't work out the way you planned

Then you look for something new
Someone else to pull you through
Someone to give you a helping hand

Hey girl won't you lend me a hand
Baby talk to me if you can
You don't understand, I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
