Lyrics:


I don't feel your love
But I don't ask too many questions
The words, they are too much
When you show me my reflection

When the sun goes down
We all get lonely
Watch me as I disappear
These empty sounds and
Endless stories
Tell me what I want to hear

(Thin white lies)
Killing me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke
The heart you broke, yeah
Calling my name
I don't wanna stay but I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
(Thin white lies)
Just one more taste of you, my love
(Thin white lies)
Killing me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke
The heart you broke, yeah

You never call me out
You know exactly where I'm going
You got me by the mouth
She said she love me
She don't show it

When the sun goes down, we all get lonely
Watch me as I disappear
These empty sounds and
Endless stories
Tell me what I want to hear

(Thin white lies)
Killing me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke
The heart you broke, yeah
Calling my name
I don't want to stay but I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
(Thin white lies)
Just one more taste of you, my love
(Thin white lies)
Killing me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke
The heart you broke

I don't think I like me anymore
Will someone tell me who I was before?
I don't really like me anymore
Anymore
Anymore

(Thin white lies)
Killing me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke
The heart you broke, yeah
Calling my name
I don't want to stay but I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
(Thin white lies)
Just one more taste of you, my love
(Thin white lies)
Killing me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke
The heart you broke, yeah

(Thin white lies)

I don't think I like me anymore
Will someone tell me who I was before?
I don't really like me anymore
Anymore
