Lyrics:


(Out in the cold)
The song that you sang so sweetly
You called it our love refrain
It's gone and I'm left completely
Out in the cold again

I dreamed that our love would linger
But just memories remain
As I gaze at that ringless finger
Out in the cold again

True it hurts my pride to step aside for somebody new
But deep down inside my whole world depended on you
I wanted your arms around me
To shelter me from the rain
But now I'm back where you found me
Out in the cold again

(True it hurts my pride to step aside for somebody new)
(But deep down inside my whole world depended on you)
I wanted your arms around me
To shelter me from the rain
But now I'm back where you found me
Out in the cold again
Out in the cold
