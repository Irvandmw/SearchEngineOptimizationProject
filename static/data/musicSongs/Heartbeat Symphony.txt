Lyrics:


Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Heartbeat-beat symphony

Sing for me in my favorite keys
A or c, yeah, that's all I need
Dance with me, show me how to move my feet
Take the lead, yeah

Cause you're like a perfect summer day
In San Francisco Bay
You make it all okay

Say woah, we go together like a symphony
Say woah, [?]
Say woah, you keep in time like a hip-hop beat
Say woah, heartbeat-beat symphony

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Heartbeat-beat symphony
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Heartbeat-beat symphony

Sometimes, it's just right
It's not a full meal, it's just a small bite
Just like a sunrise
Not too dim, and it's not too bright
I love what we got
We've never argued, we've never fought
Let's stay together, just us two
Cause all I need is you

You're like a perfect summer day
In San Francisco Bay
You make it all okay

Say woah, we go together like a symphony
Say woah, [?]
Say woah, you keep in time like a hip-hop beat
Say woah, heartbeat-beat symphony

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Heartbeat-beat symphony
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Heartbeat-beat symphony

Woah, we go together like a symphony
Say woah, [?]
Say woah, you keep in time like a hip-hop beat
Say woah, heartbeat-beat symphony

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Heartbeat-beat symphony
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Heartbeat-beat symphony
