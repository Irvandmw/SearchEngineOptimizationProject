Lyrics:


I was a cowboy, ridin' the range
I got a little boy, I guess it's not strange
I got a little cowboy now

We have fun when we shoot our gun
He always falls to the ground
He rides away with a yippy-i-ay
And he makes that pony sound

I was a cowboy, ridin' the range
I got a little boy, I guess it's not strange
I got a little cowboy now

I saw the cowboys on the TV
Now my little boy does just like me
I got a little cowboy now

He spins a rope and he rides at a lope
And he keeps his saddle dry
He rides away with a yippy-i-ay
And he makes his pony fly

I was a cowboy, ridin' the range
I got a little boy, I guess it's not strange
I got a little cowboy now
