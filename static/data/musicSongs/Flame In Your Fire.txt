Lyrics:


I SEE YOU.
PRETENDING THAT YOU DON'T HIDE
YOU TRY TO LET LOVE SLIDE
BUT INSIDE YOU ARE SEETHING
ACTING COLD
BUT SOMEBODY BRAVE AND BOLD
IS CHASIN' YOU FROM THE FOLD
AND THAT'S HIS BREATH YOU'RE BREATHING, BABY

A CHANCE MADE JUST FOR TAKING

BABY, LET ME HOLD YOU DOWN
JUST SO I CAN TAKE YOU HIGHER
MAKE YOU SCREAM WITHOUT A SOUND
BE THE FLAME IN YOUR FIRE
YEAH OOOH. OH. YEAH YEAH YEAH

I AM HERE
AND JUST SO I'VE MADE IT CLEAR
EVERYTHING YOU FEAR
IS EVERYTHING YOU'RE NEEDING, BABY

THE TRUTH IN YOU NEEDS WAKING

BABY, LET ME HOLD YOU DOWN
JUST SO I CAN TAKE YOU HIGHER
MAKE YOU SCREAM WITHOUT A SOUND
BE THE FLAME IN YOUR FIRE
YEAH OOOH. OH. YEAH YEAH YEAH

THERE IS NO ESCAPING, THIS IS A MOMENT I WON'T LET YOU MISS
I AM RIGHT BEHIND YOU, AND I AM CLOSER THAN A KISS

BABY, LET ME HOLD YOU DOWN
JUST SO I CAN TAKE YOU HIGHER
MAKE YOU SCREAM WITHOUT A SOUND
BE THE FLAME IN YOUR FIRE
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH
OH YEAH YEAH
