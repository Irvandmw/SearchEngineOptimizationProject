Lyrics:


Girls hang around 'cos I'm hot right now,
Girl your looking hot in the spot right now,
Smooth, silky skin, milk chocolate brown,
Wanna do things to you, but not right now.

Your the best looking girl in the club right now,
All the fellas show you love right now,
Struttin' your stuff, which woos the crowd,
Come on lets go, but not right now.

Touch those lips, with fingertips,
So sexy, swing those hips, got a little hold on me,

[Chorus:]
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday

That's right, listen

Love the way your body fits that dress,
I also like the way the beat moves your chest,
If you was a priest I would confess,
Hold up, hold up, but not right now,

When our bodies lock, we're so in tune,
You smell so sweet, angel perfume,
Even by that line, I don't mean to be rude,
Got me hooked and I'm all confused,

Touch those lips, with fingertips,
So sexy, swing those hips, got a little hold on me,

[Chorus:]
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday

You got a licence for your body,
You carry on you're gonna hurt somebody, somebody
It's getting hot and we're in the spot now,
Grab our coats, lets hit the door now,

I know what you like

[Chorus:]
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday
4 play, everyday, sexy, shady,
Keep in on the down low,
'Cos you like it my way, allday

That's it, thats a rap, (You better keep it moving, you better keep it moving)
Yo it's nice to be back, trust me
