Lyrics:


6 a.m. 
The clock is ringing
I need to spend an hour snoozing
'Cause I don't think I'm gonna make it

I punch in
I'm still sleeping
Watch the clock, 
But it's not moving
'Cause every day is never ending
I need to work I'm always spending

[Chorus:]
And I feel like
I'm living the worst day
Over and over again
And I feel like the summer is leaving again
I feel like 
I'm living the worst day
I feel like you're gone
And every day is the worst day ever

Yesterday was the worst day ever
And tomorrow won't be better
It's history repeating (on and on)
Summer plans are gone forever
I traded them in for dishpan water
And every day is never ending
I need to work I'm always spending

[Chorus]

it's so long
I can't go on
it's so long
I can't go on

[Chorus]
