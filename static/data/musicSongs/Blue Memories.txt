Lyrics:


Saturday evening it started all over for me
Though I promised myself never again would it be
You phoned and said meet me and even as I told you no
Temptation was a winnin' I felt my feet start to go

That's how blue mem'ries get started all over again
That's what keeps a jukebox play until you know when
And that's what makes a guy cling to warm red wine
Cause those blue mem'ries can sure get lonesome some time
Saturday evening it started all over for me...
That's how blue mem'ries...

(That's what makes a guy cling to warm red wine)
Cause those blue mem'ries can sure get lonesome some time
(Those blue mem'ries can sure get lonesome some time
Those blue mem'ries can sure get lonesome some time)
