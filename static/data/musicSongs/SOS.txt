Lyrics:


Clutching the steering wheel and crying aloud
But your voice on the airwaves drowns me out
Crazy to think that since five AM all I see is green eyes and I'm lost in them and
I get it she's tall and she's pretty and blonde and she can write one hell of a break up song but
she'll never love you like I could

Now I wonder what it's like to run my fingers through your hair
(But I'll never know)
And I wonder what it's like to come home late and have you there
(But I'll never know)
And I've memorized every line on your fingertips
And I've fantasized 'bout what it's like to say "goodnight" to your kiss

And it's crazy to think that I've given up hope
And I've sunken the ships, somebody throw me the rope
It's getting too late to be seeing your face
And I'm dreaming of the ways that you probably taste
The dimples on your cheeks, yeah, they swallow me up
And I'm lost on your body because you're making it rough
Tracing the ink on your skin in my mind
Well, your girls got an album that is better than mine

And I wonder what it's like to run my fingers through your hair
(But I'll never know)
And I wonder what it's like to come home late and have you there
(But I'll never know)
And I've memorized every line on your fingertips
And I've fantasized 'bout what it's like to say "goodnight" to your kiss

And you said you'd be back for me
Love the dimples in my back for me
And I believed it's true
And if you do all that for me at the very least I'd have to be writing this one for you

Now I wonder what its like to run my fingers through your hair
(But I'll never know)
And I wonder what it's like to come home late and have you there
(But I'll never know)
And I've memorized every line on your fingertips
And I've fantasized 'bout what it's like to say "goodnight" to your kiss

She'll never love you like I could
She'll never love you like I could
