Lyrics:


Some live with the bottle half empty
Some with the bottle half full
You'll find mine overflowin'
Or find it dry as a bone

It's day or night
It's wrong or right
There's no time for in-betweens
Dead or alive, gotta live your life

All or nothing
You either play your hand or you're bluffin'
It's now or never
I can wait but I can't wait forever
It's all or nothing now, yeah

Take the path of least resistance
Go all the way to the top
World is turning and there's no rehearsal
It's whether you're ready or not, uh

It's a yes or no
Either hot or cold
There's no time for in betweens
Dead or alive, gotta live your life

All or nothing
You either play your hand or you're bluffin'
It's now or never
I can wait but I can't wait forever
It's all or nothing now, yeah

It's day or night
It's wrong or right
There's no time for in-betweens
Dead or alive, gotta live your life

All or nothing
You either play your hand or you're bluffin'
It's now or never
I can wait but I can't wait forever
It's all or nothing, yeah
It's now or never
I can wait but I can't wait forever
It's all or nothing now, yeah

All or nothing
All or nothing
All or nothing
