Lyrics:


It's 1200 miles from Palm Springs to Texas
But tonight it's right next door
For a week each year
It's the old frontier
That's what brings them here, western atmosphere
You can't tell the dudes from real riding cowboys
When they sashay across the floor
There's the circus means, lots and lots of thrills
Folks from Houston yeah, and from Beverly Hills
Clowning from the Shamrock right to the Almiera door
You'll find it's 1200 miles from Palm Springs to Texas
But tonight it's right next door

Do you see that parade
Do you hear that parade
Coming down Palm Canyon Drive
But if you see that parade
Come on and cheer that parade if you're 8 or 85
Who's that riding up ahead
Why it's the govenor of Texas someone said
What's he doing up this way
Why it Palm Springs and Texas day

Ah, you can't tell the dudes from real riding cowboys
When they sashay across the floor
Folks are trading in all their Cadillacs
For those pinto ponies and cowhide slacks
And there's no one left down at Neiman Marcus' store
Because it's 1200 miles from Palm Spring to Texas
But tonight it's right next door
