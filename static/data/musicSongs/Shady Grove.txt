Lyrics:


A little shady grove
A memory long ago
A tale too old to know the ending

I left a fortune there
A wealth beyond compare
A love so true and rare, I spent it

I gave it all away, all away
It takes my breath away

A little shady grove
A memory long ago
A tale too old to know the ending

I gave it all away, all away
It takes my breath away

A little shady grove
A memory long ago
A tale too old to know the ending
