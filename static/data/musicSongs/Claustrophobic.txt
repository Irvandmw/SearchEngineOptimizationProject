Lyrics:


My heart beats in and out of time
My lungs close up and get so tight
That's how your loving gets me babe
That's how your love affects me babe
Repetition got me dripping sweat
But don't stop, don't finish yet (oh no)
Cause I needed more

Even if we're stuck on an elevator
Trapped in a dirty cellar
With you it's always better (ah-oh)
Yeah this kind of love is strange

I never get claustrophobic
Boy I'm loving it, loving hard
Never get claustrophobic
When you pull me in, hold me tight, I'm alright
What you're doing makes no sense to me
You can be my air when I can't breathe
I'm not claustrophobic
Oh, hey hey

I'll blow you up like a hot air balloon
At the station, yeah the train's coming soon
I'm hoping that you're ready
Ooh you better be ready
Turn me 'round like a merry go round
Turn it up while I watch you go down
Oh, gimme some more
Aye

Even if we're stuck on an elevator
Trapped in a dirty cellar
With you it's always better (ah-oh)
Yeah this kind of love is strange

I never get claustrophobic
Boy I'm loving it, loving hard
Never get claustrophobic
When you pull me in, hold me tight, I'm alright
What you're doing makes no sense to me
You can be my air when I can't breathe
I'm not claustrophobic
Oh, hey hey

So come a little closer closer
And dip a little lower lower
Ah hah oh, ah hah oh
So come a little closer closer
And dip a little lower lower
Ah hah oh, ah hah oh

I never get claustrophobic
Boy I'm loving it, loving hard
Never get claustrophobic
When you pull me in, hold me tight, I'm alright (I'm alright, hey)
What you're doing makes no sense to me (no no)
You can be my air when I can't breathe (can't breathe)
I'm not claustrophobic
Oh, hey hey (yeah)

Closer closer (I'm not claustrophobic)
Lower lower (claustrophobic)
Ah hah oh, ah hah oh (ah-hah, no no no)
Closer closer (I'm not claustrophobic)
Lower lower (I'm not claustrophobic)
Ah hah oh, ah hah oh
Ah
