Lyrics:


We came too close to the edge now
We almost died last night
This champagne looks so good now, I relapse every time
Your heart too hard to protect now, it hurts to watch you cry
My feelings mixed up right now

She never let me see her doing drugs
She knows all the bottle girls in clubs
Good girls always got a thing for the thugs
If I break up then I sick of fall in love
Sick of my heart broken, scared of fucking it up
Sleep with my eyes open, scared of callin' it love
Scared of overdosing, scared of fallin' in love
Done with my emotion

Ain't no going backwards, only going forward
I thought we were building, why you put your wall up?
Life in a Limo, smile so your skin glows
Stuntin' in a window, posted with the armor
I can see things clear, when you're falling
Watching in the night time, 'til the morning
Need a lifeline, you could call it only if you love me

She never let me see her doing drugs
She knows all the bottle girls in clubs
Good girls always got a thing for the thugs
If I break up then I sick of fall in love
Sick of my heart broken, scared of fuckin' it up
Sleep with my eyes open, scared of callin' it love
Scared of overdosing, scared of fallin' in love
Done with my emotion

This is not supposed to hurt this much
Never know you know you're worth this much
'Cause its not supposed to hurt this much
Love is not supposed to hurt this much
'Cause its not supposed to hurt this much
Never know you know you're worth this much
But it's not supposed to hurt this much
Love is not supposed to hurt this much

We came too close to the edge now
We almost died last night
This champagne looks so good now, I relapse every time
Your heart too hard to protect now, it hurts to watch you cry
My feelings mixed up right now
