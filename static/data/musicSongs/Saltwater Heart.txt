Lyrics:


Talking with myself in a land-locked parking lot
cough drop dripping from my mouth like a long shot
My writerâs blocking oh oh oh
Sick of all the small talk, dripping non-stop
from the open-mouth graves of the faux hawk cinder block malls
my blood clot pen oh oh oh

Oh maybe I could break clean
Yea, maybe I could break clean

Weâre on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
I can feel your open arms
That pure emotion
Iâm finally free again
By my own explosion
Weâre on your shore again
I can feel the ocean

Saltwater running through my veins like a blind spot
Like I got caught, saltwater like a teardrop
With a saltwater heart oh oh oh
Now itâs an abstract thought but Iâve been thinking non-stop
'bout the fact that my bodyâs made most out of raindrops
With a saltwater heart oh oh oh

Oh maybe I could wash clean
Yea maybe I could believe

Weâre on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
I can feel your open arms
That pure emotion
Iâm finally free again
By my own explosion
Weâre on your shore again
I can feel the ocean

Maybe I could wash clean
Yea maybe I could wash clean
all my land-locked dreams
And maybe I could believe

Weâre on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
I can feel your open arms
That pure emotion
Iâm finally free again
Like my own explosion
Weâre on your shore again
I can feel the ocean

I can feel the ocean
