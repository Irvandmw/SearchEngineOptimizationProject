Lyrics:


[Chorus:]
You better come on
In my kitchen,
It's going to be rainin' outdoors.

The woman I love stole my best friend.
Some joker got lucky, stole her back again.

[Chorus]

Uh huh, she gone, know she won't come back.
I take the last nickel out of her nation sack.

[Chorus 2x]

When a woman get in trouble, everybody throws her down.
Looking for her good friend, they can't be found.

[Chorus]

Any time you've coming, it's gonna be so.
You can't make the winter, baby, just drive on slow.

[Chorus 2x]
