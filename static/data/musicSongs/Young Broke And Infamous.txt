Lyrics:


I don't even know, tell me world, where am I to?
Young, broke and infamous, I'm feelin' kinda low
Love game fucked up, money game ditto
Studyin' the greats, but they got me feelin' little
Feelin' like a crazy person, feelin' a genius
Feelin' like an asshole, feelin' like the meanest
Where am I to go now?
Where am I to go now?

I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous

Mighty strokes of war
Have already been dealt against the enemy
What kind of a people do they think we are?
Is it possible that they do not realize
That we shall never cease to persevere against them
Until they have been taught a lesson
Which they and the world will never forget

I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
