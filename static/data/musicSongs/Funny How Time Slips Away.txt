Lyrics:


Well hello there
My it's been a long, long time
How'm I doin'
Well I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now, and it seems now
That it was only yesterday
Gee it's funny how time slips away

How's your new love
I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him till the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me
And it seems like yesterday
Gee it's funny how time slips away

I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you around
I don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember, when I tell you
That in time you're gonna pay
And it's surprisin' how time slips away
