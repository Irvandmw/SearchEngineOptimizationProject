Lyrics:


Goodnight, sweet Jesus
Goodnight, goodnight

Goodnight, sweet Jesus
Guard us in sleep
Our souls and bodies
In thy love keep

Waking or sleeping
Keep us in sight
Dear gentle saviour
Goodnight, goodnight

Goodnight, dear Jesus
Goodnight, goodnight

Goodnight sweet Jesus
Pray that each day 
Of our lives mortal
Thus pass away 

Thy love o'er watching
Guiding our right
Dear gentle saviour
Goodnight, goodnight

Goodnight dear Jesus
Goodnight, goodnight
