Lyrics:


Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm hanging from a cloud, I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand, walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
This magic I hear, I get misty the moment you're near
You could say that you're leading me on, but it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see just how hopelessly I'm drawn, that's why I'm following you
On my own, would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left, my hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love on my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat and my glove, I get misty and too much in love
Look at me
