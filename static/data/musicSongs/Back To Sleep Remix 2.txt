Lyrics:


[Verse 1: August Alsina]
I just wanna rock you all night long
Believe me when we both want your love
I wanna get into you so deep I'm touching your soul
No holding back, baby, let go
I'm about to hit that, it's 'bout to make you climax
All that you can get back to sleep soon
Or you can take the day off so that I can stay off in it
You can stretch up to the roof
Let me dive deep in your mind
Ain't got time, you're lost and I feel it
I know you're ready for this sexual healing

[Chorus: Chris Brown & August Alsina]
Just let me rock, fuck you back to sleep, girl
Oh, girl
Don't say a word, no, don't you talk
Don't stop it now, don't stop it now
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, rock you back

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Deep, babe, I know exactly how to treat you
Fuck you like a poet, babe
You're nasty and I know it, babe
I'm talking mind sex, cause I'll fuck your mind first
Then I fuck you crazy, you'll come every time, baby
You know daddy's home, baby, you know that's right
Spit on it, choke, grab on your throat, cum for me, beg for it
Baby, I got that bomb dick
Tell your sister and your mom that I don't beg
Cause I fuck you like I hate you
But I kiss you like I miss you
Ooh, you got that jacuzzi and I got that Messi for you

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Miguel]
Just let me rock, fuck you back to sleep girl
Open up, open up, baby girl
No, don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, rock you back

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Baby, I know it's late, yeah
I've been so frustrated
Today's been a little bit hard on me
And I just had to call and tell you I'm missing you
Oh, all the things I'll do to you once I get in the room
I hope you're in the mood
Just leave the keys to the door the same place you left them before
I'll be there around 4, you know what I came for
Oh, baby, assume the position
We 'bout to try every position
Play your games, tomorrow you gon' have to redo them braids
Cause I'mma sweat 'em out
Baby, spread 'em out
You know what to do with them legs and I know what to do with this head
Cause you got all of the right features
Baby, you're wet as the Caribbean beaches
I wanna dive all in your sea
Girl, let me fuck you back to sleep

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Just let me rock, fuck you back to sleep girl
Rock you with the D, girl
Don't say a word, no, don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me, girl
I'll fuck you back to sleep, girl, and rock you back

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya
Ain't sorry, 'bout to fuck
Fuck you back to sleep, girl
Go to sleep in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
And rock you back
Ain't sorry that I woke ya
Ain't sorry, 'bout to fuck
Fuck you back to sleep, girl
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
