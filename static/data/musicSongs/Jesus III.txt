[III:]
One shoebox full of mula (Jeez)
I been stacking this shit for a minute (Woo)
Y'all are going cold as a cooler (Woo)
Wanna know about me, go ask them bitches (Woo)
.40 with a 30 round clip (Grrt), now who wanna see me? (Woo)
And that foreign go skrrt, I let down the window, blowing gas like it's legal (Woo)
Put that dick on her, she holla
Bring me two million RosÃ© bottles
Hit they ass with that choppa, I bet they gon' hate it
Get the fuck out my section if you not a model

[DaBaby:]
I'm Baby Jesus, tell me what you know about me
I don't fuck with these niggas, they act just like bitches, I'd rather have hoes on me
Give a fuck 'bout security, nigga try me in the club I'ma bomb
And she cute and she nasty, I can't let her pass me, that bitch got a onion
You gon' get me in trouble, my ho said she gone on that Hennessey
Just met a stallion, she told me she feeling me
Say she attracted to all my energy
I don't know why all these bad bitches into me
I guess it's the flavor, I don't got no type
She ain't tryna speak and she don't wanna meet ya
She prolly conceited, yeah, that what I like
Ayy, coming onto me, baby, shout out the DJ, he got my shit spinning
And Ku, that's my nigga, if you check the score, it'll tell you we winnin'
And other niggas gotta show me something
I walk around like I'm the chosen one
Stop lying, stop lying, they know you frontin'
These niggas funny, Baby

Whole Cuban LInk, wear a kilo
You see me HD, nigga, kino
Make a movie all the time, Tarantino
Used to serve the junkies through the peephole
Turn while your bag full of eggrolls
School book bag or the bubble
Always stayed in some trouble
Came from the struggle, hustle hustle hustle
Lookin' for a come up, pour the drank, nut up
She'll flip a drink for her daddy, bitch, shut up
Cartier frames, no tint
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
If you ain't gettin' money, you ain't got no cents
Real niggas only, bad bitches only
But it's only one three, see these niggas try to clone me
Redbone suck me to sleep, head crucial
I like me a young whore, I love me a cougar
Shooter stay tooted, booted, trick out a molly
My fellowship stupid, ugly, moogly
Loud-mouth, fruity
Tooted with a booty
Blonde white MILF named Regina
I ice off the wall, MJ club
Tell these niggas beat it, beat it
Yoppa undefeated
Yop, yop, yop, niggas get your ass beat for three
