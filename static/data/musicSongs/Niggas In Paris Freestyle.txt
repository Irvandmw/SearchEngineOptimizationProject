[T-Pain]
Itâs your turn Chris
Lets go baby
I SAID LETS GOOOO...

[Chris Brown]
Look, I just came to get rid of every nigga
To murder every rapper, watch a nigga come up outta me
Iâm stuntinâ hard on these muthafuckas
Flying on the VMAâs. Evel Knievel, the nigga proud of me
Iâm drinking this shit til 5 in the morning
Your girls number 1 pick, call me Mr Lottery
I let a hater nigga die, POW, like itâs suicide
I ainât giving no more fuckinâ apologies
Stunt so hard, that shit crazy
Ain't shit free, fuck you pay me
Heron flow from the 80â²s, my chain on me like we made it
My Kinfolk got 10 hoes, 5 whites, 2 blacks like 3 Asians
My Benzo got damn hoe, nigga take this shit Iâm too faded
Go âhead and bring yo crown over
Ass kisser, brown noser, fuck yo luck, I smoke clovers
Iâm partying with boat owners
Marilyn Monroe hoes all on us
Rookie tryna get ya signing bonus
Nigga look at my chain man, I paint ya face, you a clown homie
Not tryna throw subliminal, my Porsche got force and driftaco
Even if its just 10 of yaâll I put in the old school and you pin up dolls, YIKES!
That shit crazy, donât you play me
You tryna get on this bus, bitch sign this waiver
Holâ up, holâ up, gimme that Chardonnay and that Marvin Gaye shit
But holâ up, my conversation too complicated, this bitch too basic
You ain't no groupie girl and you know that I wonât say shit
You got skeletons in your closet
I got aliens in my basement
