Lyrics:


[Zion:]
El club no es el mejor sitio para encontrar el amor, no, no, no
Yo me jugarÃ­a todo para que conmigo se dÃ© un shot
Ven a ver, yo lleguÃ© solo en busca de ti
Ya me imagino lo que vamos a hacer
SÃ© que andas sola en busca de mÃ­
Yo lo sÃ©

[Ed Sheeran:]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Ed Sheeran (Zion):]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

OhâIâohâIâohâIâohâI
I'm in love with your body
OhâIâohâIâohâIâohâI
(Y la manera que me baila asÃ­)
OhâIâohâIâohâIâohâI
(Enamorado de tu cuerpo)
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Lennox:]
Baby, yo sÃ© lo que quieres
Y yo vine a darte placeres
Eres la mÃ¡s linda, la que mis ojos quieren
La que mi cuerpo prefiere
Dame, dame de eso (Mamacita)
Yo quiero mÃ¡s de ti
Dame de tu cuerpo que me excita
Dejaste mi cama oliendo a ti

[Ed Sheeran:]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
[Lennox:]
Ella me dice: "No hablemos de mÃ¡s
AgÃ¡rrame por la cintura y no me sueltes mÃ¡s
SÃ³lo sÃ­gueme, sÃ­gueme, yeah"

[Ed Sherran (Lennox):]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

OhâIâohâIâohâIâohâI
I'm in love with your body
OhâIâohâIâohâIâohâI
(Y la manera que me baila asÃ­)
OhâIâohâIâohâIâohâI
(Enamorado de tu cuerpo)
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Ed Sherran:]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Zion & Lennox:]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

Yo lleguÃ© solo en busca de ti
Ya me imagino lo que vamos a hacer
SÃ© que andas sola en busca de mÃ­
Yo lo sÃ©
Dame, dame de eso (Mamacita)
Yo quiero mÃ¡s de ti
Dame de tu cuerpo que me excita
Dejaste mi cama oliendo a ti

I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
