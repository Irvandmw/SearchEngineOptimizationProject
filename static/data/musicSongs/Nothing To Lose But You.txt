Lyrics:


I stay up every night
I should've thought twice when I put our lives on the line
I'm a mess
You're the only hope that I hold inside

The self-destruction, the damage I've done
You're the reason I'm still alive

And I lose it everyday inside of my head
I don't know if I'll be alright
I wanna leave it all behind
I've got nothing to lose

I've got nothing to lose but you
Nothing to lose but you
I know that I can't undo
The self-destruction, the damage I've done
I've got nothing to lose but you

Take a step, I will follow
Til the end of the earth
Through the best and the worst
Cause you know all my secrets
All my demons and you keep 'em in check

And I lose it everyday inside of my head
I don't know if I'll be alright
I wanna leave it all behind
I've got nothing to lose

I've got nothing to lose but you
Nothing to lose but you
I know that I can't undo
The self-destruction, the damage I've done
I've got nothing to lose but you

And I lose it everyday inside of my head
I don't know if I'll be alright
Cause if I didn't have you, I'd be better off dead
You're the reason I'm still alive

I've got nothing to lose but you
Nothing to lose but you
I know that I can't undo
The self-destruction, the damage I've done
I've got nothing to lose but you

And I lose it everyday inside of my head
I don't know if I'll be alright
Cause if I didn't have you, I'd be better off dead
You're the reason I'm still alive

I've got nothing to lose but you!
