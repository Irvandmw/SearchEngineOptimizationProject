Lyrics:


Baby's got a lot of baggage...
It don't seem to matter, it don't seem to matter
Got a ticket for the mid-west, just for business
but dismissed it for the interest
it was a risk just for a mistress that was a hostess on the west-coast
Don't youï»¿ see it in my eyes tonight-ight-iiiight
...Baby's got a lot of baggage

Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo - Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
ãã¿ãã®ãã [Kimi Tanoshimu]
Tokyo, Tokyo - Pay in the palms of theï»¿ rock'n'roll

Get that dynamite ...
Chicka-Boom on the down tonight
I never seem to get it right
But you can show me so politely
Now don't you see it in my eyes tonight-ight-iiiight
...Get that dynamite

Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo - Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
ãã¿ãã®ãã [Kimi Tanoshimu]
Tokyo, Tokyo - Pay in the palms of theï»¿ rock'n'roll

HEY! I come back to where you are [x2]
Give that dynamite

Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo - Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
ãã¿ãã®ãã [Kimi Tanoshimu]
Tokyo, Tokyo - Pay in the palms of theï»¿ rock'n'roll

Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo - Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
ãã¿ãã®ãã [Kimi Tanoshimu]
Tokyo, Tokyo - Pay in the palms of theï»¿ rock'n'roll

(hey!) Iï»¿ come back to where you are [x2]

Tooo-ooookyyyyooooooooo-oo-ooo
Tooo-ooookyyyyooooooooo-oo-ooo
Tokyo!
