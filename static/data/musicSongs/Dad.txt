Lyrics:


Everyday and every night
Wondering why you can't be by my side
All of those times, I said you were wrong
Well I'm takin' them back 'cause the wait is too long
If you could stay, for the rest of my life
I wouldn't mind since you'd be by my side
Cause everything changes, whenever you leave
Please Dad oh, please, stay with me

Whenever you're gone I can hardly breathe
So please stay with me, stay with me
Cause all that I have is me and my dreams
Please stay with me, stay with me
No don't go, cause I don't know what I do
There ain't no father like you
There ain't no father like you

For all of those days, and all of those nights
I pictured you everywhere in my side
How you make me laugh until I cry
Only you could tell me why
If you could stay for the rest of my life
I wouldn't mind since you'd be by my side
Cause everything changes whenever you leave
Please Dad oh, please, stay with me

Whenever you're gone I can hardly breathe
So please stay with me, stay with me
Cause all that I have is me and my dreams
Please stay with me, stay with me
No don't go, cause I don't know what I do
There ain't no father like you
There ain't no father like you
