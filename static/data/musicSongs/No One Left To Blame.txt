Lyrics:


You're a modern individual
With a mind that's strong and free
And it got you what you wanted
From the day you came to be

But when you got what you wanted
It could never quench your thirst
So you blamed the ones around you
For not warning you first

But now the ones around you
Are going and of no use
'Cuz as the last one vanishes
She takes the last excuse

There's no one left to blame
You're the cause of your pain

Love made you forget it
Love of every hue
A mother's love, a father's love
A lover's love, a child's love

But it came back again
And you felt like you'd lived through
An almighty deception
Designed just for you

But the almighty deception
Gives while you just take
It's living all around you
While you're holdin' its wake

There's no one left to blame
You're the cause of your pain

You blamed it on the market
For burdening you with wealth
You blamed it on the whisky
As if it poured itself

Dive into the mystic
So you don't have to think
Find another suspect
Find another shrink

There's no one left to blame
You're the cause of your pain
There's no one left to blame

There's no mystery
Not even the one that you see

There's no mystery
Not even the one that you see

There's no mystery
Not even the one that you see
