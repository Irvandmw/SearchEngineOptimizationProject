Lyrics:


There's a peddler comes to our house
With such wonderful bargains to sell
And he starts our hearts to tingling
Just as soon as he pushed the bell

With his pots and pans so shiny
He's more fun than a penny arcade
Won't you listen to his sing song
Of the peddler's serenade

(Shim a lish a wanna shim a lish a wanna)
What's you gonna buy today
(Shim a lish a wanna shim a lish a wanna)
She's a-like a give away
If you want to buy say you're gonna buy Angelina don't be afraid
(There's where our money goes for the funny peddler's serenade)

Angelina come-a down-a
It-sa the man he's back on the door
He's a gotta more to show you
Than the five and ten cents store
If you're gonna catch-a new husband
He's-a gotta 'bout all the you need
Only don't-a go for the peddler
He's already one wife and a kid

(Shim a lish a wanna shim a lish a wanna)
What's you gonna buy today
(Shim a lish a wanna shim a lish a wanna)
She's a-like a give away
If you want to buy say you're gonna buy Angelina don't be afraid
(There's where our money goes for the funny peddler's serenade)

Every body loves our peddler
He's always so merry and so gay
He's-a pans they clang and they clatter
Making wonderful music all day

There's one for macaroni
And-a one for the garlic and the sauce
It's-a gotta long handle for showing the husband who's boss

(Shim a lish a wanna shim a lish a wanna)
What's you gonna buy today
(Shim a lish a wanna shim a lish a wanna)
She's a-like a give away
If you want to buy say you're gonna buy Angelina don't be afraid
(There's where our money goes for the funny peddler's serenade)
There's where our money goes for the funny peddler's serenade
