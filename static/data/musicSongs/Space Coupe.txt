Lyrics:


Ooh, oh (My DM, my DM)
They said all I want is this so can I see them?
Ooh, ooh, I'm gone, I'm on
Damn, we on, fuck it, you come on
I'm gone, I'm on
Damn, we on, fuck it, you come on
Ayy, Royce, you did it right here

Yeah, I woke up a hunnid' bitches in my DM
They said all I want is this, so can I see them?
Make cash, run it up, and spend it for no reason
I want everything around me every weekend
She said "I just want you", but I don't want to
Hunnid' mil', throw some racks, blew it 'cause I want to
They know it's me, and I pull up in a space coupe
They know they can't beat me so they would rather race you

I woke up, a hunnid' bands this morning (Bands)
I just fucked your bitch, that's a morning (Lil' bitch)
Shoot a nigga down, yeah (Boom, boom)
Know we scorin'
That's that lean (Gang)
That we pourin'
Ooh, I'm gone, I'm on
Damn we on (Damn), fuck it you come on
Shoot you, then we gone (Boom, boom)
We get it on
Diamonds flashin', yeah
Patek, got it on (Patek)

I woke up a hunnid' bitches in my DM
They said all I want is this, so can I see them?
Make cash, run it up, and spend it for no reason
I want everything around me every weekend
She said "I just want you", but I don't want to
Hunnid' mil', throw some racks, blew it 'cause I want to
They know it's me, and I pull up in a space coupe
They know they can't beat me so they would rather race you
