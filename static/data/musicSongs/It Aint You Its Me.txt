Lyrics:


Barefoot, front porch, swingin' here all alone
I'm tracing my steps, tryna figure out what went wrong
You were here one minute and the next you leave
Now I'm stuck here tryna breathe
Note that says "It ain't you, it's me"

But it ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding around this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
It ain't you that's been trying to call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holding memories
It ain't you, it's me

I found some stuff I just couldn't throw away
Some old t-shirts and pics of us in a frame
I talked to the walls like they feel my pain
'Cause the echo of you is here to stay
I'm just stuck, trying to find what it means
It ain't you, it's me

But it ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding around this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
It ain't you that's been trying to call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holding memories
It ain't you, it's me

It ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding around this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
But no, it ain't you that's been trying to call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holding memories
It ain't you, it's me
Mmm, it's me...
