Lyrics:


Take control of who you are
Stay the same don't let them change you
Take control of who you are
Cause ain't nobody going to save you

Take control of who you are
When the world is getting stranger
Take control of who you are
Stay the same don't let them change you

But when it comes apart,
When it comes apart to start again
And open up your heart,
Take control of who you are

Take control of who you are
When you're looking in the mirror
Underneath the skies
You will see a little clearer

Take control of who you are
When the world is getting stranger
Take control of who you are
Show the people what you're made of

And when it comes apart,
When it comes apart just start again
Open up your heart,
Take control of who you are

And when it comes apart,
When it comes apart just start again
Open your heart,
Take control of who you are

When it comes apart
And when it comes apart just start again
Open up your heart
Take control of who you are
