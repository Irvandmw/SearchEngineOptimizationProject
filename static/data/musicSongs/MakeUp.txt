Lyrics:


Blush, eyeliner
Hush, see what you made me do?
Base, mascara
Erase, I wanna look good for you
Comb, hair
Don't care, I hate to comb my hair
Make-up

Pink, blue
Purple, I wanna make it good for you

Make-up

If I wear a dress
He will never call
So I'll wear much less
I guess I'll wear my camisole

Make-up

Make-up

Smoke a cigarette
I'm not ready yet
Make-up
Make-up
Make-up
Smoke a cigarette
I'm not ready yet
