Lyrics:


Climb into the ring for a battle that you can't win
Swing as hard as you can swing, it will still mean nothing
Shouldâve seen it coming
It had to happen sometime
But you went and brought a knife
To an all out gun fight

And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

Youâve gone too far
(get up, get up)
Who do you think you are
(get up so we can finish this)
Is this what you came for
(get up, get up)
Well this means war
(get up so we can finish this)

Say anything you want
But talk will get you nowhere
The only thing you've brought was psychological warfare
Well thereâs no getting out
And now you got to wonder
Who will dig you out when youâre six feet under

And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

Youâve gone too far
(get up, get up)
Who do you think you are
(get up so we can finish this)
Is this what you came for
(get up, get up)
Well this means war
(get up so we can finish this)

And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

Youâve gone too far
(get up, get up)
Who do you think you are
(get up so we can finish this)
Is this what you came for
(get up, get up)
Well this means war
(get up so we can finish this)

Well this means war
