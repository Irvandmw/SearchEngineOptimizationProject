Lyrics:


I said, sorry I didn't finish
Sorry you didn't fit
I tried to make it work
Can't really wrap my hands around it
Yeah, we could try again
When I'm done feeling sore
Maybe you're just a friend
Whose not looking for more

Wish I could stop but it feels so good
I wish I could stop but it feels so good
I wish I could stop, stop
And then he said, don't got a dirty mind
But that's what she said
That's what she said
That's what she said
That's what she said
That-that-that-that's what she said

I said, sorry I didn't finish
Sorry you didn't fit
I tried to make it work
Can't really wrap my hands around it
Yeah, we could try again
When I'm done feeling sore
Maybe you're just a friend
Whose not looking for more

Wish I could stop but it feels so good
I wish I could stop but it feels so good
I wish I could stop, stop
And then he said, don't got a dirty mind
But that's what she said
That's what she said
That's what she said
That's what she said
That-that-that-that's what she said
...
