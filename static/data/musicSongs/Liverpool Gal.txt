Lyrics:


When first I came to London Town
A stranger I did come
I'd walk the streets so silently
I did not know no-one
I was thinking thoughts
And dreaming dreams
The kind when you roll along
But most of all I was thinking about
The land I'd left back home

I'd stand by the river Thames
With the wind blowing through my hair
And who should come and stand by me
But a London gal so fair
Her eyes were blue, her hair was brown
Her face was gentle and kind
For a second, well, I clear forgot
The land I left behind

As we began walking and talkin'
All through the English air
I did not know where we'd end up
'Til we came to the top of a stair
As we lay round on a worn-out rug
The room it was so cold
And we talked for hours by the inside fire
'Bout the outside world so old

All through our sweet conversation
She thought my ways were so strange
But I know there was one thing about me
That she would try to change
And the night passed on with the drizzeling rain
There's one thing I found out
A pair of sweet curls I know too well
Her love I know not much about

And I awoke the next morning
And the rain had turned to snow
I looked out of her window
And I knew that I must go
I did not know how to tell her
I didn't know if I could
But she smiled a smile I'd never seen
To say she understood

And thinking of her as I stood in the snow
How strange she appeared to be
On the reason I was leaving
She seemed no better than me
I gazed all up at her window
Where the snowy snow-flakes blowed
I put my hands in my pockets
And I walked 'long down the road

So it's now I'm leaving London, boys
Well, the town I'll soon forget
Likewise its winds and weather
Likewise some people I met
But there's one thing that's for certain
Sure as the sunshine down
I'll never forget that Liverpool Gal
Who lived in London Town
