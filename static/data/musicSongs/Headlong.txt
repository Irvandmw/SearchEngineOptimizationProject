Lyrics:


And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothin' you can do about it

There's nothin' you can do
No, there's nothin' you can do about it
No, there's nothin' you canâ, nothin' you canâ, nothin' you can do about it

And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
No, there's nothin' you can do about it

Yeah

Hey, he used to be a man
With a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman
With a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do

Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight then it ain't so groovy
When you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap 'B' movie

Headlong
Down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you canâ, nothin' you canâ, nothin' you can do about it

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do (ho)
Soon the fire starts a raging
Gets 'em more than half crazy
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do

Oh, now they start freaking every way you turn
You can't start walking 'cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
'Cause reason's out the window
Better hold on tight

You're rushin' headlong
Headlong
Out of control, yeah
You think you're so strong
There ain't no stopping
And there's nothing youâ, nothing youâ, nothing you can do about it at all

Yeah, yeah! Alright! Go!

And you're rushing headlong
Down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothing, nothing, nothing you can do about it, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ha-ha

Headlong
Headlong
Rushing, rushing, rushing, rushing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rushing, rushing, rushing, rushing
Headlong
Headlong
Headlong

[In reverse:]
Headlong, headlong, headlong, headlong
