Lyrics:


It's been seven hours and thirteen days
Since you took your love away
I'd go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you've been gone
I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose

I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothingâI said, nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing comparesâ
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing

It's been so lonely without you here
I'm like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?

I could put my arms around every girl I see
But they'd only remind me of you

I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, "Boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing comparesâ
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing

All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with me, baby, was some kind of hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

'Cause nothing comparesâ
No, nothing compares to you

I said, nothing compares to you
Oh, no, no nothing compares to you
