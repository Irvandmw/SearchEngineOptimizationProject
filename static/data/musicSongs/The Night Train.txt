Lyrics:


Used to be around
Lost and found
Thinking it's good
That's the way it should
Standing in the rain
Waiting for the train
'Cause I miss you honey
Baby I do, I do...

Can't take it anymore
Going next door
Gonna find out[?]
What it's all about
I'm standing in the rain
Waiting for the train
'Cause I miss you honey
Baby I do, I do

And I want you, I want you
Kept out baby on the night train
I want you, I want you
Kept out baby on the night train
Well I want you, I want you
And I'm kept out baby on the night train
I want you, I want you
I'm kept out baby...

No, it's not right,
When you're outta sight
Feeling so slow
Letting you go
'Cause I need your helping hand
Oh, I need it bad
'Cause I miss you honey
Baby I do, I do

And I want you, I want you
Kept out baby on the night train
I want you, I want you
Kept out baby on the night train
Well I want you, I want you
And I'm kept out baby on the night train
I want you, I want you
I'm kept out baby, on the night train

And I'm not gonna go back home
And I'm not gonna go back home
And I'm not gonna go back home
Gonna go back home...

'Cause I want you, I want you
Kept out baby on the night train
I want you, I want you
Kept out baby on the night train
Well I want you, I want you
And I'm kept out baby on the night train
I want you, I want you
I'm kept out baby, on the night train

Yeah, yeah...
