Lyrics:


Your baby said goodbye like I knew she would
This time your baby is gone for good
Well she found true love with another man
So live and learn to forget her
If you can

Just live and learn, it's a game of love
Sent down to you now from up above
And it's up to you to make the love light burn
Just live and learn, live and learn
Baby live and learn

If you've got a good gal, you'd better treat her right
Give her plenty good lovin', mornin', noon and night
Because she might leave town on a midnight train
And then you're tears are gonna fall
Like the cold, cold rain

You gotta live and learn, it's a game of love
And hope little cupid will give your heart a shove
Well you gotta know, when it comes your turn
Just live and learn, live and learn
Baby live and learn

Just live and learn, it's a game of love
Sent down to you from up above
It's up to you to make the love light burn
Just live and learn, live and learn
Baby live and learn

You gotta live and learn, live and learn
Live and learn
You gotta live and learn, live and learn
baby live and learn
You gotta live and learn, live and learn
Live and learn
