[Chris Brown (A1):]
Hold it down, don't never get caught out of bounds (down, brrr)
Get dope, lost Jose, I'm out of town (brrr, brrr)
Pay the price, good deal, pay the price (price)
Where the vibe? My girl singing like she Kelly Price (vibe, ooh)
Up and down, ass jumping up and down (down, down)
Blue flag, strippers in here dolling up (flag, yah)
Beat the case, yesterday I beat the case (case, beat the case)
Your mistake, judge made a big mistake (mistake)

[Chris Brown (A1):]
Acres now, crib got some acres now (now, got some acres)
Ten rooms, pool party every night (rooms, swin)
Listen to me, sensei listen to me (to me, to me)
Show some manners, ride it good, keep your balance (manners, balance)
She a night light, I'ma blow her lights out (night light, yeah)
She off a coke combination, Percocets and white out (ooh)
I teach her how to whip, break it down and flip it (whip, flip it, ooh)
Back and forth, back and forth like she playing tennis (ooh)
