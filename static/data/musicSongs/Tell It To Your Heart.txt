Lyrics:


Tell it to your heart
everyone's a star
So she said
And landed in the street early one morning
right in front of me she threw out her spell 

Tell it to your mind
leave it all behind
Now we will spread our wings and fly under the great skies
through the night so blue
I'm holding on to you 

[Chorus:]
She came to me like an angel
when everything was torn apart
Erasing all the madness
she came and blessed a broken heart 

Listen to the sound
Grace is all around
You will see
So invisible and so insane in the darkest blue
It's waiting for you 

[Chorus:]
She came to me like an angel
when everything was torn apart
Erasing all the madness
she came and blessed a broken heart 

No reason to forget
No reason to regret
No reason to deny
And time for asking why 

[Chorus:]
She came to me like an angel
when everything was torn apart
Erasing all the madness
she came and blessed a broken heart
