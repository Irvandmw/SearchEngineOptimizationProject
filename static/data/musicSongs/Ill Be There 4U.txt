Lyrics:


[Intro:]
6-5-4-3-2-1
7 Days of Funk

[Hook:]
Iâll be there for you
When you need some company
Right there for you
Baby, baby, come to me
Right there for you
If you need that fire weed
Let me light that for you
Canât you see Iâm all you need?
Right there for you

No talk, itâs all real
I gotta let you know how I really feel
Do or die, itâs you and I
Now have a seat

[Pre-Hook:]
Let me get you to the funk baby
Let me get you to the funk girl
Let me get you to the funk baby
Let me get you to the funk girl

[Hook:]
Iâll be there for you
When you need some company
Right there for you
Baby, baby, come to me
Right there for you
If you need that fire weed
Let me light that for you
Canât you see Iâm all you need?
Right there for you

[Verse:]
Think Iâve had enough
But itâs a must I find my way back to the funk
High and low which way she go
Can someone please let a G know?
Boosy Collins, George Dew
James Brown and uncle Jamâs troops
George Clinton, the atomic dog
24 track mixed in analog
Canât a dog just be on a tree
Iâm a blind man so I see, I see
6 lines with strings to attach
2-12 homies to match the hippie uh
Sell a quick load
And now Iâm walking on a yellow brick road, funk mode
Do or die, itâs you and I
Now have a seat

[Pre-Hook:]
Let me get you to the funk baby
Let me get you to the funk girl
Let me get you to the funk baby
Let me get you to the funk girl

[Hook:]
Iâll be there for you
When you need some company
Right there for you
Baby, baby, come to me
Right there for you
If you need that fire weed
Let me light that for you
Canât you see Iâm all you need?
Right there for you

Iâll be there for you
