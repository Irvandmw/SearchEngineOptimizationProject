Lyrics:


Here I am waking up, still can't sleep on your side
There's your coffee cup, the lipstick stain fades with time
If I could dream long enough, you'd tell me I'd be just fine
I'll be just fine

So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with this shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

Cleaning up today, found that old Zeppelin shirt
You wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt
We're too young, too dumb, to know things like love
But I know better now, better now

So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with this shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

(Fine)
Too young, too dumb
(Fine)
To know things like love
(Fine)
Too young, too dumb
(Fine)

So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with this shot of truth
That my feet don't dance like they did with you
