Lyrics:


All aboard... stitching time
Get yours... got mine
In a minute... I'll be there
Sit tight... get square
You can do it at the hippodrome
Slide back... trombone
Anybody got a TV at home
Thats right... unknown

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman send me some
Better get up on your run

So much more than
Charlie's waking me
To my core and
Charlie's shaking me
Tell my story
And Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile
Oh, Oh, now

Everybody... do the twist
Get the message... on Flea's fists
Move around like a scientist
Lay down... get kissed
Big picture and it never lies
Big daddy... will advise
Ever ready... in disguise
Sunset... sunrise

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman send me some
Better get up on your run

So much more than
Charlie's waking me
To my core and
Charlie's shaking me
Tell my story
And Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile
Oh, Oh, now

My heart... Your skin
This love... I'm in
We don't arrive, without a surprise
You're right... I'm wrong
Be free... Be long
Intimate sight has come into light

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman send me some
Better get up on your run

All I ever wanted to
Was pick it up and run with you
Slip it into a summer spell
Double up and run like hell

So much more than
Charlie's waking me
To my core and
Charlie's shaking me
Tell my story
And Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile
Oh, Oh, now

My heart... Your skin
This love... I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right... I'm wrong
Be free... Be long
Intimate sight has come into light

My heart... Your skin
This love... I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right... I'm wrong
Be free... Be long
Intimate sight has come into light
