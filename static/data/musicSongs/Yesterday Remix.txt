Lyrics:


[Toniâs Verse]
Gave you the benefit of the doubt
Til you showed me what you were about
Your true colors came out, ooohhh

And your words couldnât hide the scent
Cuz the truth about where youâve been
Is in a fragrance I cant recognize

Standing there
Scratching your head
Blood shot eyes, drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge

Im done with this
Feeling like an idiot
Loving you, Im over it
I just donât love you, donât love you no more

[Chorus]
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought youâd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
Say, you, you are so yesterday
I wont let you rain on my parade
Donât wanna hear a thing you say
So Yesterday

[Treyâs Verse]
Baby whatchu saying to me is
Theres no more you and I
Couldnât get it right on yesterday
So kiss our tomorrows goodbye

Baby love shouldâve brought me home
Shouldâve just been a man about it
But now im crying like a baby
Girl your love is like my blanket
Donât know what to do without it

Standing here, pleading my case
But you donât care to hear what I say
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge, oh no babe
My promises donât mean nothing
The end is so disgusting
I just donât love you, donât love you no more

You, you are so yesterday
Never thought youâd lose my love this way (I never thought)
Now you come begging me to stay
Say, you, you are so yesterday
I wont let you rain on my parade
Donât wanna hear a thing you say
So Yesterday

And now you wanna reminisce (now I wanna reminisce)
Say you wanna try again (said I wanna try again)
Started with a little kiss (a kiss, a kiss)
We cant even regret (no no)
Now I never wanna see you, never wanna feel you
Never wanna hear you
I donât love you, donât need you, cant stand you
No moreâ¦

[CHORUS]

So yesterday
So yesterday
So yesterday
