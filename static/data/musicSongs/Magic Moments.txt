Lyrics:


Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing

I'll never forget the moment
We kissed the night of the hayride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm
While taking a sleigh ride

Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring

Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

The telephone call
That tied up the line for hours and hours
The Saturday dance I got up the nerve
To send you some flowers

Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring

Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

(The way that we cheered
Whenever our team was scoring a touch down)
The time that the floor fell out of my car
When I put the clutch down

(The penny arcade, the games that we played
The fun and the prizes)
The Halloween hop when everyone came
In funny disguises

Magic moments
Filled with love
