Lyrics:


Love all night, work all day
Ain't nothin' wrong with a-livin' day to day
Something's wrong, we gotta make it right
We gotta help one another just to make it through another night

We ain't here for a long time
So let's make tonight the right time

Oh yeah
Love all night, work all day
Ain't nothin' wrong with a-livin' day to day

Oh (Yeah)
Ain't nothin' wrong with a-livin' pay to pay

We ain't here for a long time
So let's make tonight the right time

Oh, love all night, work all day
Ain't nothin' wrong with a-livin' day to day, mmm
Ain't nothin' wrong with a-livin' pay to pay

Mmhmm
Oh yeah
Yeah, ain't nothin' wrong with it
Oh oh
Oh, ooh, yeah
Hey
