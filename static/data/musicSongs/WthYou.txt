Lyrics:


Come on

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold and the static
And I put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering Iâm pretending to be where Iâm not anymore
A little taste of hipocrisy
And Iâm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though youâre so close to me
Youâre still so distant
And I canât bring you back

Itâs true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if youâre not with me

Iâm with you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong
I pretend that the past isnât real
Iâm trapped in this memory
And Iâm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though youâre so close to me
Youâre still so distant
And I canât bring you back

Itâs true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if youâre not with me

Iâm with you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No, I wonât let you control my fate
While Iâm holding the weight of the world on my conscience
No, I wonât just sit here and wait
While you weighing options
Youâre making a fool of me
No, you didnât dare try to say that you donât care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
No, it ainât like me to beg on my knees
Oh, please, oh, baby, please
Thatâs not how Iâm doing things
No, Iâm not upset
No, Iâm not angry
I know love is love, 
Love and sometimes it pains me
With or without you
Iâll always be with you
Youâll never forget me
Iâm keeping you with me
No, I wonât let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn it and torture my soul
No, Iâm not your puppet
And, no, no, no, I wonât let you go

No, no matter how far weâve come
I canât wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far weâve come, I
I canât wait to see tomorrow

With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
