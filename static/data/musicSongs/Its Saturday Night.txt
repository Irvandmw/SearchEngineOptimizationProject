Lyrics:


It's Saturday night, I'm feeling on song
I think I'm alright, I know I'm all wrong
The drink that I had, three hours ago
Has been joined by fourteen others in a steady flow

So let me walk straight, don't let me feel pain
I'm gonna scratch cars, with my key again
Cause when I go home, and fall on my bed
If it doesn't leave my stomach, it'll split my head.

Cause when I go home, and fall on my bed
If it doesn't leave my stomach, it'll split my head.

It's Saturday night, I'm feeling on song
I think I'm alright, I know I'm all wrong
The drink that I had, three hours ago
Has been joined by fourteen others in a steady flow
