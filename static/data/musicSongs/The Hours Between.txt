Lyrics:


Your love began
It couldn't fly so it ran
On legs of animal instinct
Stronger than
Some deadening plan
That doesn't see the power
Of the space between the trees
And the hours between the hours

Some try to make themselves fall
Some don't believe it at all
Some like the peace and the silence
Some like the pain and the violence

Your love broke free
Of what you thought it would be
It crossed every "I"
And dotted every "T"
Made lots of fun of your disease
Took pleasure in your shame
And a hammer to your knees

Maybe you're on the wrong track
But you'd never find the way back
To where you were when it was just you
There's nothing can bring any sense to

Your love that lives
And loves to laugh at the hate
To triumph over it daily
To demonstrate
To take lots of time
To think about the power
Of the space between the trees
And the hours between the hours
