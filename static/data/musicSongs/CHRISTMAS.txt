Lyrics:


When I was but a youngster
Christmas meant one thing,
that I'd be getting lots of toys that day

I learned a whole lot different  
when Mother sat me down  
and taught me to spell 'Christmas' this way: 

'C' is for the Christ child, born upon this day
'H' for herald angels in the night
'R' means our Redeemer
'I' means Israel 
'S' is for the star that shone so bright  
'T' is for three wise men, they who travelled far  
'M' is for the manger where He lay 
'A' 's for all He stands for 
'S' means Shepard's came 

And that's why there's a Christmas day! 

And that's why there's a Christmas day!
