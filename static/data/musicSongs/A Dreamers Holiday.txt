Song Name: A Dreamer's Holiday
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Climb aboard a butterfly and take off in the breeze,
Let your worries flutter by and do the things you please,
In the land where dollar bills are falling off the trees,
On a dreamer's hol-i-day.

Ev'ry day for breakfast, there's a dish of scrambled stars,
And for luncheon, you'll be munchin' rainbow candy bars; 
You'll be livin' a-la-mode on Jupiter and Mars
On a dreamer's hol-i-day.

Make it a long vacation; time there is plenty of.
You need no res-er-va-tion -- just bring the one you love.

Help yourself to happiness and sprinkle it with mirth,
Close your eyes and concentrate and dream for all you're worth;
You will feel ter-rif-ic when you get back down to earth
From a dreamer's holiday.

Make it a long vacation; time there is plenty of.
You need no res-er-va-tion -- just bring the one you love.

[Repeat Final Verse]

From a dreamer's hol-i-day.
