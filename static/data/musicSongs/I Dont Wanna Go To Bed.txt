Lyrics:


I gotta tell you the truth
Iâm full of broken pieces
And all my nights are sleepless
And I donât mean to intrude
This secret can you keep it?
Wonât give up even if it...

Takes me all night,
Takes my whole life,
Just wonât feel right, (until I have you)
Tired eyes burn,
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do

[Chorus:]
I donât want to go to bed
I donât want to go to bed (No)
I donât want to go to bed
I donât want to go to bed without you.
[x2]

Letâs get this out of the way
Why should we wait forever?
Weâre meant to be together.
Iâm not ashamed to say (let me tell you one time)
You donât remember my name
But I still want you the same

Love at first sight,
Left me tongue tied,
Just wonât feel right (until I have you)
Tired eyes burn,
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do... (tell me what to do)

[Chorus x2]

[Nelly:]
I donât wanna go to bed without ya,
No you no lie no sleep without ya,
Go crazy in the...
I go crazy without ya,
Eâry dream, eâry nightmare's about ya.
I canât lie, got love at first sight,
Love the first night, I took my first bite.
Iâm, insane when I take aim, like,
King James with the mid-range BANG!

Love at first sight,
Left me tongue tied,
Just wonât feel right (until I have you)
Tired eyes burn,
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do...

[Chorus x3]

I donât wanna go to bed without ya,
No you no lie no sleep without ya,
This is Simple Plan Shorty!

I donât want to go to bed without you!

I said
I donât wanna go to bed without ya,
No you no lie no sleep without ya,
No you no sleep!

I donât want to go to bed without you.
