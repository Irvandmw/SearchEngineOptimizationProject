Lyrics:


Wait a moment yet
Have a cigarette
We can stand out here on the pavement

There's a young man near
With the same idea
And a half-drunk beer as payment

But we turn his offer down
Give him a light and watch him frown
As he weaves his way back round
Into the crowd

Many years ago that was us, I know
When they said this place was dying
But just look now, look all around
If you squint, you'd swear it was thriving

Now it's we who are in decline
Like the old shipyards and mines
We outlived a time 
That's long passed away

I thought we'd change things
But we never changed a thing
We never changed a thing

There's a girl
There's another
That one looks familiar
I think I knew her mother

Wait a moment yet
Have a cigarette
They let us stand out here on the pavement
Just look now, look all around
Now that's what I call entertainment

I thought we'd change things
But we never changed a thing
We never changed a thing
