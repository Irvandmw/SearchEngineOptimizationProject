[Bebe Rexha:]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When was the last time that you called me beautiful?
I don't need to hear it, but it'd be nice to know
And I don't remember the last time I got off on ya
'Cause you get off on me, but I get off alone

You better give it to me when I want it
I shouldn't have to ask for it
Give it to me when I want it, yeah, yeah

So baby, tell me why you never buy me flowers no more?
You're getting comfortable, you're getting too comfortable
Why you never wanna open my door?
You're getting comfortable, you're getting too comfortable, yeah

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're getting too comfortable, comfortable
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)

[Kranium:]
You nuh see mi a try, please give mi a bly, fi mi be di man mi suppose to be
I can't buy you gift every single day, baby just please it a get to me
You nuh see mi a try, please give mi a bly, fi mi di man mi suppose to be
I can't buy you gift every single day, baby just please it a get to me

I treat you so damn good, yet you can't see you
Worryin' 'bout things I haven't done lately, yeah

[Bebe Rexha:]
Why you never buy me flowers no more?
You're getting comfortable, you're getting too comfortable
Why you never wanna open my door?
You're getting comfortable, you're getting too comfortable, yeah

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're getting too comfortable, comfortable
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're getting too comfortable, comfortable

Yeah, you're getting a talk now
Boy, you better get it back now
Step it up, or you're gonna have to step out
Right now, better show me what you got now
Give me love, give me life
Better give it to me when I want it
I shouldn't have to ask for it
Give it to me when I want it, yeah yeah

So baby, tell me why you never buy me flowers no more?
You're getting comfortable, you're getting too comfortable
Why you never wanna open my door?
You're getting comfortable, you're getting too comfortable, yeah

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're getting too comfortable, comfortable
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're getting too comfortable, comfortable

I bought you roses (I did)
Do all the things I'm supposed to do (open your eyes, baby)
Yeah, nothing that I do is good enough for you (oh, girl)
Baby, what you putting me through?
