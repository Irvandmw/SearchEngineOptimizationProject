Mambo, Huncho

Not everyone is coming to the future
Not everyone is learning from the past
Not everyone can come into the future
Not everyone that's here is gonna last, gonna last

Not everyone is coming to the future
Not everyone is coming from the past
Not everyone can come into the future
Not everyone that's here is gonna last, gonna last

You ain't woke
Come here woke and
Hear the broken
Come give hope
Come give life
Only get one, so we gotta live it right
(Gotta live it right)

Come, make peace, uh
Come to pick an inspiration
Come complete you
Advise, positive vibes (Positive vibes)
Open your mind (Open your mind)
Open your eyes (Open your eyes)
Yeah (Yeah)

Not everyone is coming to the future
Not everyone is learning from the past
Not everyone can come into the future
Not everyone that's here is gonna last, gonna last

I hope you know, know
My life is gold (Gold)

Just free your mind (Free)
Welcome to the future, it's a culture ride (Ride)
Too much pain inside
It's an override

You've been puttin' too much time tryin to survive (Tryin')
Don't like the person in your past, so you let 'em die

We can light up the dark
Everyone has a spark
Don't tell me to stop
'Cause you said so (Oh Yyah)
Your future is bright (Bright)
Just don't turn off the light (Lights)
Tell the sun not to shine (Bright)
'Cause you said so

Not everyone is coming to the future (No)

Not everyone can come into the future (To the future)
Not everyone that's here is gonna last, gonna last (Last)

To the future
From the past

It's the future where we come from, bein' stars
It's the future where we come from, bein' hard
It's the future where we come from, beat 'em all
It's the future where we come from, bein' boss
It's the future where you gotta pay the cost (The future)
It's the future where you come from, bein' lost (The future)
It's the future, crucifixion on a cross (Woo)
But you know that I'ma rise above it all, yeah
