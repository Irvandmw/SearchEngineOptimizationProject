Lyrics:


They say love is just a game
They say time can heal the pain
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And I guess I'm just a fool
I keep holding on to you

I told you once you were the one
You know that I'd die for you
Although it hurts to see you go
Oh, this time you should know
I won't try to stop you

Don't you forget about me baby?
Don't you forget about me now?
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go?

So you try to fake a smile
You don't wanna break my heart
I can see that you're afraid
But baby it's too late
'Cause I'm already dying

Don't you forget about me baby?
Don't you forget about me now?
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go?

Wherever I go, I won't forget about you (oh no, oh no, oh no)
Wherever you go, don't you forget about me?
