Lyrics:


It's been nine days, eight hours, forty minutes, ten seconds since you called
I've been so crazy I've just about taken our picture off the wall
It's been three months over hundred days since you held my hand
And I miss you in a thousand ways will I ever see you again?

How did it change so fast?
(I won't give you to the past)
I really thought it'd last

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my
Everything, everything, everything?
(Everything, everything, everything)

It seems like everywhere everyone's in love, so, where are you?
And I remember you couldn't get enough, you felt it too, oh, dear you

How did it change so fast?
(I won't give you to the past)
I really thought it'd last

All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my
Everything, everything, everything?
All that we had was so unbelievable
Now that it's gone it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my
Everything, everything, everything?
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything

You're really my everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything

(Everything, everything, everything)...

It's been nine days, eight hours, forty minutes, ten seconds
Three months, and a hundred days
And I miss you in a thousand ways
Will I ever see you again?
