Lyrics:


Heart and soul
I fell in love with you heart and soul
The way a fool would do madly
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night

Heart and soul
I begged to be adored
I lost control and tumbled overboard gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist
Oh but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so faintly willing
But now I see what one embrace can do
Look at me it's got me loving you madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul

Now I see what one embrace can do
Look at me it's got me loving you madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul
