Song Name: The Small Exception Of Me
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Everybody knows you're leaving me for good
Everybody tells me now they knew you would
It's a well known secret I just couldn't see
And the whole world knew with a small exception of me

Everybody knows we cried our final tears
Everybody knows we wasted all these years
Long ago they said I'd have to sat you free
And the whole world knew with a small exception of me

With a small exception of me the world is wise
With a small exception of me it's no surprise

So it's funny the way that I could be so blind
Funny when it's out of sight it's out of mind
Now the truth has known and it's plain enough to see
That the whole world knew with a small exception of me
