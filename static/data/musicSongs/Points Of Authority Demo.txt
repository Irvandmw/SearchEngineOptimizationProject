Lyrics:


[Mike Shinoda:]
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

[Chester Bennington:]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life
My pride is broken

[Mike Shinoda:]
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

[Chester Bennington:]
I won't believe a word you say
I'll cut to pieces by the sound of every breath you take
Swimming through a sea of hurt
My life
My pride is stronger

[Mike Shinoda:]
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim

It's time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim
It's time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim

[Mike Shinoda:]
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
