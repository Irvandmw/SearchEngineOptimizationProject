Lyrics:


The first thing every morning
And the last thing every night
I think of you and all the things you say and do
If only you were here to whisper sweet things to.

I tell you how much I love you
How I'm longing to hold you tight
Yeah, the very first thing every morning
And the last thing every night.

I tell you just how much I love you
And how I'm longing to hold you tight
The very first thing every morning
And the last thing every night.

The very first thing every morning
And the last thing every night...
