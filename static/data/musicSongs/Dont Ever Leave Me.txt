Lyrics:


Don't ever leave me..
Don't say goodbye..
If you do, I'll be the lonely one,
I'll sit down and I will cry...

Don't ever tell me,
Don't say we're through
If you do, I'll be the lonely one..
I'll sit down' and I'll cry over you..

No matter what you should say to me..
No matter what you do..
It would mean nothing at all to me
Because I'm so in love with you... 
(I love you)

Don't ever change dear,
Oh Don't say we're through
If you do, I'll be the lonely one
And I'll sit down and I'll cry over you...
Oh I'll sit down and I'll cry over you...
