Lyrics:


I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight
Hold on, hold on

I keep lettin' you back in (You back in)
How can I explain myself?

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
(Murda on the beat)
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
(And I'm gon' murder the beat)
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
(Yeah, aye, hot girl, hot girl, hot girl)
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me (Yeah)
(Aye, hot girl, hot girl, yeah, ahh)
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

Picture me rollin', cadillac coastin'
I can finally get my momma all the money I owe her
I been pumping myself up and now they watching me blow up
Used to have a bad temper now I'm trying to control it

Aye, send a text to my ex, told him I wish him the best
And I really mean it, and he ain't work for me but I know somebody gon' love him
But he gon' still give me hug when we see each other
Because I got that sticky, icky, like a sycamore
I hop up out that benz, finna make him sicker more
He ain't gon' get no sleep at night like a party next door
He trying to about less and now he see me more
I got that little shop of horrors, yeah that Seymour
And he ain't get the vision then now he see it more
And any bitch after me is just a decoy
You know you don't want her, you need me boy
And I wrote this on my way to a dick appointment
Ex nigga keep calling, and I keep ignoring
How you mad at me? You the one who cheating on me
And you don't need me, nigga, you need neosporin
I break it down, break it down, like a old man
Talk about me to his kids when he a old man
Like "she the one that got away", like "oh man"
All on me now but he ain't want me back then
I got that Mike Jones, 281-330-8004
He mad at me 'cause I like to play nice to some of these niggas
'Cause that's how you get all the funds from these niggas
Yeah, ahh
Aye, aye, I said you gotta play nice to some of these niggas
'Cause that's how you get all the funds from these niggas
Yeah, ahh

Hot girl, hot girl
Hot girl, hot girl
Young Tina Snow, coming soon
Yeah, ahh
