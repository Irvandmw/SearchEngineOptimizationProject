Lyrics:


Let's go

They wanna know if he can rap, I tell em really
Tell my bitches call me Meek 'cause I done finally got a millie
You know how bitches like to act when they get pretty
Like to turn a nigga down, that's how I act when I get jiggy
Fuck around and tell her, "No", I wanna fuck the bitch that's witcha
We out of Backwoods, shit fuck it, get a Swisher
Smoke a blunt, don't do no other drugs, turn up, go get some liquor
And I know I look good, so take your picture, nigga

Aye bae, I know that I look good, you ain't gotta cap
It ain't my birthday but I wish a nigga would, I ain't gotta rap
Blow out a candle on her booty, that's that cake, she make it clap
She make it shake, we at the shack, she tryna break a nigga back
Yeah, I skipped class, when I was a jit with no hall pass
And I drop dick, I pick it up then I haul ass
She say she wanna fuck, she don't wanna take a picture
Her pussy NyQuil, I go to sleep every time I hit her
Don't know the password, so, that ain't me if they respond on my Twitter
I got that hot shit, these niggas gotta go rewind it to hear it
They know I pop shit, I'll pop a nigga right now, they know I'm with it
And I only fuck with bitches if they pretty

They wanna know if he can rap, I tell em really
Tell my bitches call me Meek 'cause I done finally got a millie
You know how bitches like to act when they get pretty
Like to turn a nigga down, that's how I act when I get jiggy
Fuck around and tell her, "No", I wanna fuck the bitch that's witcha
We out of Backwoods, shit fuck it, get a Swisher
Smoke a blunt, don't do no other drugs, turn up, go get some liquor
And I know I look good, so take your picture, nigga

It's 4X
They wanna know if he can spit for real
He think I'm cappin', he think I can't get em' killed for real
Aye, try yo luck, I drop some chip and get you zipped for real
A couple racks ain't shit, bitch, I signed for a couple mill
I send shit up like I popped a wheelie
Got rich like Roddy, I stood on that block like Meek Millie (rich)
Red rag, blue faces, you know my pockets crippin'
I pop tags and drop bags, you play they poppa, nigga
All my neighbor's white folks, they be thinking I'm a dealer
It's 4X, I killed this beat 'cause I'm signed to a killer
And I know she want me 'cause I'm a young rich nigga
And I can't beef with you, if you can't show me six figures, on gang

They wanna know if he can rap, I tell em really
Tell my bitches call me Meek 'cause I done finally got a millie
You know how bitches like to act when they get pretty
Like to turn a nigga down, that's how I act when I get jiggy
Fuck around and tell her, "No", I wanna fuck the bitch that's witcha
We out of Backwoods, shit fuck it, get a Swisher
Smoke a blunt, don't do no other drugs, turn up, go get some liquor
And I know I look good, so take your picture, nigga
