[Chorus:]
Meet me out, can you make it?
Please donât make me lie to you, lady
Iâm in it, Iâm not in it, but poochie says women
At the club we finna go, sip some drink and hit some dro
Itâs ok if you donât go, Iâll make sure to tell you 'bout these pros
Itâs like somebodyâs growinâ them on trees
So many pros, itâs like somebodyâs growinâ them on trees [x3]
So many...

[Verse 1:]
All the ugly people, hold on
I can see all the pretty people, on
Not saying that Iâve never been wrong
But tonight I got me a hot, come on
Now let me talk to ya, girl

[Bridge:]
For your um, for your information, baby
Iâm that winner, you need to go and ask somebody
For your um, for your information, baby
Iâm that winner, you need to go and ask somebody

[Chorus:]
Meet me out, can you make it?
Please donât make me lie to you, lady
Iâm in it, Iâm not in it, but poochie says women
At the club we finna go, sip some drink and hit some dro
Itâs ok if you donât go, Iâll make sure to tell you 'bout these pros
Itâs like somebodyâs growinâ them on trees
So many pros, itâs like somebodyâs growinâ them on trees [x3]
So many...

[Verse 2:]
We party to the break of dawn
Every girl just dance with nothinâ on
Where we at they donât see nothinâ wrong
Well you know we were outside on the lawn
Now let me talk to ya, girl

[Bridge:]
For your um, for your information, baby
Iâm that winner, you need to go and ask somebody
For your um, for your information, baby

[Chorus:]
Meet me out, can you make it?
Please donât make me lie to you, lady

Itâs ok if you donât go, Iâll make sure to tell you 'bout these pros
