[DaBaby:]
Ayy
Yeah, yeah

Let me snap off the rip (Ayy)
I done got back in my bag (Bag)
I just be stackin' my chips (Turn up)
I'm tryna roll up while I drive
I'm gon' end up crashin' the whip (Ayy)
She like to cut up when she ride (Ride)
We gon' end up havin' some (Uh)
I'm gon' end up spazzin' again
I fucked her once and I had her again (Yeah)
And my shit so hard when I freestyle
I don't need to havin' a pen
I live it, I don't need to write it (Huh, yuh)
So don't even try it
I'm havin' a drink on the plane (Plane)
I sit at the front like the pilot (Huh)
I know that little ho, that's your main (Main)
I'ma fuck her and run up her mileage (Ha)
She keep tryna suck on the dick (Why?)
'Cause I drip like a motherfuckin' stylist

And I just got a DM from your best friend

My bitch bad, whip fast

Bitch, I'm a dog off the leash (Grr)
I need a motherfuckin' muzzle (Woof)
She tried to play hard to get (Ha)
But I figured her out like a puzzle (Yeah)
She get all the bread from her dad (Dad)
She get all the ass from her mother
Her head so good it made me love her (Huh?)
Her head so good it made me love her (Yeah)
I had to say that shit two time (Yeah)
She blow up my phone, get a new line (Brr)
I'm chargin' the ho for the dick
She can't use a motherfuckin' coupon (Ha)

And I just got a DM from your best friend

The money is old and stale (Huh?)
How I spent one-fifty on a necklace? (Yah)
How I fuck around, crash the whole Bentley?
How you rich but your bank account empty? (Empty)
She want a little bit of Fendi (What?)
She want some dick and a bag, too
She better have my ticket to CancÃºn (Yeah)
They mad, it's nothin' I can't do (Woo)
