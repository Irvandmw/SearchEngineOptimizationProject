Lyrics:


We were playing the Powerpuff Girls and Buttercup was a monster and I played the Mayor and Blossom was Ms. Bellum
Then Buttercup wanted to pretend she was Blossom, but Blossom wanted to be Blossom, and I wanted to be Bubbles, but they told me I couldn't
And no one wants to be me!

I'm sensitive you know

Get out my bubble
If you ain't popping like I am
Bitch you ain't popping like I am
Bitches ain't popping like I am

If you ain't popping [x8]
No one wants to be me! [x4]

Get the point
You don't get my point
(Ain't popping )
You ain't winnin' you ain't gettin' points
(Like I do )
Just be sharp, just like me I pop
Like a bubble butt
Careful when it drop
You baffoon popping like balloon
NPR drop my fucking tune
I'm so powerpuff I am so cartoon
I'm hunting wabbits you a looney toon
We pop a bottle then I pop my fuckin poon
Been the queen since I was in the womb
I'ma iPod you're a fuckin zune
Out my bubble lil bitch give me room

Fuck out my bubble like Glinda
No clarinet out my bubble like squidward
I am that bitch cuz I sample Nintendo
No sugar coat out my bubble like Splenda

Get out my bubble
If you ain't popping like I am
Bitch you ain't popping like I am
Bitches ain't popping like I am

If you ain't popping [x8]
No one wants to be me! [x4]

You could shade but it's factual
You ain't team if you ain't popping like this
Bet you dream bout being popping like this
It's a shame you ain't popping like this

This don't come natural
Workin' hard on a 9-5 shift
Everyday's just another celebration
All you fakes need get how I live

Thank goodness, I found you!
Are you okay?
Did you stop the giant ant?
What's the matter? Why don't you say anything?
Oh, I get it! You're too cool to talk to a dork like me, right?
Fine!
Bubbles! Nope, bubbles!
I'm not listening

Get out my bubble
If you ain't popping like I am
Bitch you ain't popping like I am
Bitches ain't popping like I am

If you could shade but it's factual
You ain't team if you ain't popping like this
Bet you dream 'bout being popping like this
It's a shame you ain't popping like this

This don't come natural
Workin' hard on a 9-5 shift
Everyday's just another celebration
All you fakes need get how I live

First you take the pink and then some blue
And then the green and then more pink
And then a dash of blue
Coloring, coloring, coloring
Grab another color, doo dee doo!
Mwah, I drew us
