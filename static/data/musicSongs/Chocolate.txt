Lyrics:


I was with this girl
In my bedroom
She was eating such wild chocolate
Didnât leave me much shared room
Its name I couldnât see
But she gave it to me
I lost my head
I started singing

Only the crumbliest
Flakiest chocolate yeah
Taste like chocolate never tasted before
Only the crumbliest
Flakiest chocolate yeah
Taste like chocolate never tasted before

Then I was gone
In a world of my own
Feels like electricity is
Running through every bone
My girl and me
Weâre living free yeah
On the crumbliest milk chocolate in the world
We were singing

Only the crumbliest
Flakiest chocolate yeah
Taste like chocolate never tasted before
And only the crumbliest
Flakiest chocolate
Taste like chocolate never tasted before
