Lyrics:


Let me know when you ready
I'm ready now
Baby Jesus though
And say it again, more extra
I'm not hyped
Nah, see that's the problem, I need you to turn up for me real quick
Smack yourself on the ass one time
I just ate pork chops
You just ate pork chop?
Yes, nigga, I just ate pork chops
You-You save me one?
Ha, nah, there was only 4 pieces
That's fucked up. I need you to say it for me though, I need you to, say it one more time for me
Why you didn't catch me in the daytime?
I wasn't at the studio yet
Oh my God, hold on, my phone about to cut off line
Don't let it cut off, just scream it one more time for me
Baby Jesus though!
Yeah, and I need you to uh... But I need more of that up-North accent on it. So just like that, but more of that up-North accent
Lucy, come say it
No, I want your voice
She from-She just came from Connecticut, so
Okay, let me-Yeah, her too. Her too, that'll work
Come here, Lucy
How do I say it?
Like with your Richport accent, like, you're not from Conneticut, like a bird
She said "I ain't saying that shit"
Baby Jesus though, no, ew, just like a bird
She said she sound like a bird. Okay, but these country niggas like that shit!
These country niggas like birds
Come here, Elijah
She said she gotta get in bird mode
She gotta get in bird mode?
Alright, what I'm sayin'? "Pull it out, let me see it?"
Yeah, "Pull it out, let me see it."
Alright, 123, can you do the 123? Say that
1, 2, 3
Pull it out, let me see it
Thank you so much
