Lyrics:


(Love me right) Love me
(Love me right) Come on
(Love me right, love me right) You got to do it to me right.

What could take the place of you? Nothing in the whole world
Youâve been bad boy even though Iâve been a good girl
Well the point is Iâm in love
And youâre not acting like you should
You have treated me so wrong
Treated me bad and that ainât good (come on)

Love me right (love me right)
Make my body jump and shout tonight (you gotta love me right)
Make me have to say âOh me oh myâ (love me right)
Youâre quite a guy (dynamite)
Love me right (love me right)
Love me right (love me right)
Take me to the highest kind of height (you gotta love me right)
Give me all youâve got and donât be jive (love me right)
(Fight after fight, stay tonight) Love me right

My friends can see that you are shady (well)
You donât treat me like a lady, uh uh (uh uh)
I used to ignore that information, about your reputation (bad)
But you donât leave me much choice
Itâs been so long since I heard your voice
Not another night will I let you walk leaving me to cry (come on)

Love me right (love me right)
Make my body jump and shout tonight (you gotta love me right)
Make me have to say oh me oh my (love me right)
Youâre quite a guy  (dynamite)
Love me right (love me right)
Love me right (love me right)
Take me to the highest kind of height (you gotta love me right)
Give me all youâve got and donât be jive (love me right)
(Fight after fight, stay tonight) Love me right

I ainât never gonna love no one who donât love me right
If you keep treating me wrong you donât love me right
Donât be jive keep love alive, come on love me right
We can start real love tonight, come on and love me right

(Love me right, jump and shout tonight, you gotta love me right)
(Love me right, youâre quite a guy, dynamite)
(Love me right, highest kind of heights, you gotta love me right)
(Love me right, fight after fight, stay tonight)
