Lyrics:


Black crows in the summer sky. Wheat fields turned to gold
Workers in the blazing sun. Forests in the cold
Farmers in a cabin room. Portraits of your eyes
Look at me in painful gloom, they've seen so many lies
You who love the truth, you who love the truth
You who love the truth have seen, so many lies

Skeletons smoke cigarettes. A blazing sun that never sets
A purple forest in the haze. Hands that know of common ways
Some survive their shattered dreams, but you are lost in colour schemes
Falling down between the seams, you've seen so many lies
You who love the truth, you who love the truth
You who love the truth have seen, so many lies

I wonder how you'd feel today, if you knew the millions that they'd paid
For canvas glowing with your heat, shown in airconditioned suites
With glass and steel and carpet floors, stored in crypts as cold as yours
Portraits of your bleeding eyes, eyes that saw so many lies
You who love the truth, you who love the truth
You who love the truth have seen, so many lies
You who love the truth, you who love the truth, you who love the truth
