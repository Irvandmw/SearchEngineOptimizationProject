Lyrics:


Don't you know that we're able?
Let alone makes us major
We can now sit at the table
And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)

Yes, we can
Yours and mine [?]
Yes, we can
Are one and one equals three
Yes, we can
I feel it like lightning in the forest
Yes, we can
And they can know, they can know the woman as a chorus

You're my woman, don't need another [?]
We can make each other talk like whether we may never, woo

Don't you know that we're able?
Let alone makes us major
We can now sit at the table
And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)

Yes, we can
Like a solar system but surrounded by you
Yes, we can
On another star this is ain't true
Yes, we can
We shine so bright [?]
Yes, we can
Who can beat a distance when you know whose force?

You're my woman, don't need another [?]
We can make each other talk like whether we may never, woo

Don't you know that we're able?
Let alone makes us major
We can now sit at the table
And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah

Baby, yes, we can
The love that we had like the clouds and the sky
Baby, yes, we can
We ain't in no rush, we take our time blowing by

You're my woman, don't need another [?]
You're my woman, don't need another [?]
