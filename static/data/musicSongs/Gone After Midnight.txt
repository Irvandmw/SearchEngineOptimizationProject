Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I been here waiting for someone to share my vision
Coming here tonight was not the best decision
You look like someone who might welcome some direction
You look like one who's grown accustomed to attention

Come and be yourself with me baby talk to me
Loose your self inside the beat

[Chorus:]
I won't be gone after midnight I'm not at dream
This dream vill vanish in daylight but I will be

My life is a late night party in the smokey light
Strangers move together whispering sweet lies
Dancers move like lovers leave the world behind
A secret wish takes hold and burns down deep inside

Common people find uncommon states of mind
You'll want it more and more each time

[Chorus:]
I won't be gone after midnight I'm not a dream 
This dream vill vanish in daylight but I will be
