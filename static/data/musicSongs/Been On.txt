Yeah, yeah

I finna work, what you been on?
Niggas talkin shit- get ran on
Wood to the face got me so gone
Bandz on my neck, you don't mean that
Shit getting hard to fend off
Niggas poppin Glocks so they ran off
Working in the trap- that's your daily
All these money bitches goin crazy

I finna work, what you been on?
Niggas talkin shit- get ran on
Wood to the face got me so gone
Bandz on my neck, you don't mean that
Shit getting hard to fend off
Niggas poppin Glocks so they ran off
Working in the trap- that's your daily
All these money bitches goin crazy

Let me tell you what you can't do:
Run up the check then act like a damn fool
You ain't getting no racks, you a broke nigga
We be blowing gas like a toke nigga
You is a lick, my niggas is hit, so nigga don't say you was about it
We on some shit, your bitch we just hit, we getting rich I don't doubt it
Niggas I swear they some ops, so I don't be fucking with it
Your bitch she be stuck on my dick, my stack game be crazy and shit
So 20 somethin can't even count all that shit, ballin I know you be seeing my fists
Young niggas wild and shit, young niggas pay us your whip, ayy

I finna work, what you been on?
Niggas talkin shit- get ran on
Wood to the face got me so gone
Bandz on my neck, you don't mean that
Shit getting hard to fend off
Niggas poppin Glocks so they ran off
Working in the trap- that's your daily
All these money bitches goin crazy

I finna work, what you been on?
Niggas talkin shit- get ran on
Wood to the face got me so gone
Bandz on my neck, you don't mean that
Shit getting hard to fend off
Niggas poppin Glocks so they ran off
Working in the trap- that's your daily
All these money bitches goin crazy

I don't know what you thought, nigga y'all know me
Nigga ride in the drop, with my hunna on me, yeah
I be [?], yeah
[?] cause I ain't chase the money all week, ayy yeah
I do this, call my phone like "Who dis?" (who dat?)
Niggas chew this, loose funds bounce back too quick (Nah.)
If hoes choosey, you might wanna duck, you loosey
Can't snooze this, talkin shit over "Who knew this?"

I finna work, what you been on?
Niggas talkin shit- get ran on
Wood to the face got me so gone
Bandz on my neck, you don't mean that
Shit getting hard to fend off
Niggas poppin Glocks so they ran off
Working in the trap- that's your daily
All these money bitches goin crazy

I finna work, what you been on?
Niggas talkin shit- get ran on
Wood to the face got me so gone
Bandz on my neck, you don't mean that
Shit getting hard to fend off
Niggas poppin Glocks so they ran off
Working in the trap- that's your daily
All these money bitches goin crazy
