Lyrics:


Sound the bugle now, play it just for me
As the seasons change remember how I used to be
Now I can't go on, I can't even start
I've got nothing left, just an empty heart

I'm a soldier: wounded so I must give up the fight
There's nothing more for me, lead me away...
Or leave me lying here

Sound the bugle now. Tell them I don't care
There's not a road I know that leads to anywhere
Without a light I fear that I will stumble in the dark
Lay right down. Decide not to go on

Then from on high somewhere in the distance
There's a voice that calls, "Remember who you are.
If you lose yourself your courage soon will follow.
So be strong tonight. Remember who you are."

You're a soldier now fighting in a battle
To be free once more.
Yeah, that's worth fighting for
