Lyrics:


Broken again
Iâm down on my knees ripped apart
But I see you out there
So Iâm taking these chains off my heart

Iâm listening close for you
Feeling my way out the dark
Iâm on my way to you
And won't nothing keep me from you

So Iâll just free run,
'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run,
'til I find myself right where you are, oh
Whoa, whoa, Iâll free run to you
Whoa, whoa, free run to you

Life with you leaving,
Is like being locked upside down
Iâm all out of reasons to let
All this hurt keep me bound

Iâll listen close for you
I donât wanna miss the good parts
Iâm on my way to you
And wont nothing keep me from you

So Iâll just free run,
'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run,
'til I find myself right where you are, oh
Whoa, whoa, Iâll free run to you
Whoa, whoa, free run to you

So Iâll just free run,
'til my feet start to lift off the ground
I will just free run,
'til I find myself right by your side, oh
Whoa, whoa, Iâll free run to you
Whoa, whoa, free run to you
