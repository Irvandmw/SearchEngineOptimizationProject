Lyrics:


Sweetheart, the night is growing old
Sweetheart, my love is still untold
A kiss that is never tasted
Forever and ever is wasted

For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go make this moment, uh, sweet again
We wonât say goodnight, not until the last, the very last minute
Iâll hold out my hand and nothing but my heart will be in it

For all, for all we know this may only be a sweet dream
But we come and weâve got to go, just like the ripples on a stream
Oh, love me, love me tonight, tomorrow was made for some
But for us tomorrow may, may never come, for all we know
