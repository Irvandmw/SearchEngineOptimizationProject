Lyrics:


Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste

Such a sentimental love
In a cynical world
My feelings get the best of me
I messed it up before
So I'm almost pretty sure
My karma got the best of me

Bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

When you walk away
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones
You don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away

I've been dreaming like a fool
In a nightmare of a world
It's bringing out the worst in me
Shook me to the core
My optimism floored
My karma got the worst of me

Bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

When you walk away
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones
You don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away

I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?

Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones
You don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away

I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
When you walk away
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
When you walk away
