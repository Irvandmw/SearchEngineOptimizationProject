Lyrics:


[Intro:]
Okay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Juto:]
Wonderful beauty queen
You're the only one for me
It don't matter how it seems
But you can come kick it with me
Well, can I ask you, baby
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Well, I'm gone, gone

[Logic:]
Ayy, it's that Bobby Boy, better known as chocolate and vanilla
Ain't another iller, I'm that new to godzilla
I feel a sensation, vibration comin' on
Walk up in the spot like a motherfuckin' don
What's up with you, shorty? Tryna get to know you
I know we went to school together, that's the old you
Never told you how I felt, I feel I owed you
Never really tried to talk to you because of old you
But beautiful, beautiful, beautiful girl
Don't you walk out my world
Everything that the boy feel for you, girl
It compiles my world

[Juto (Logic):]
Tell me that you're satisfied
Without me right by your side
No, no, please don't run and hide
Let your man give you a ride
No, no, please don't run and hide
(Skippity, bop, bop, na, na ,na ,na)
(La da-da, la da-da da da-da da)

[Logic:]
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Well, I'm gone, gone and
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Well, I'm gone, gone and

[Juto:]
Wonderful beauty queen
You're the only one for me
It don't matter how it seems
But you can come kick it with me
Well, can I ask you, baby
