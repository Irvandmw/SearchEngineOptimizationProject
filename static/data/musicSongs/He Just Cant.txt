Lyrics:


Last night picture of flouted desire
Is broken, defeated, heâs lost all his fire

He knows she wonât take him back
No matter how much he begs her
He knows she canât take him back
Aww, he just canât face the fact

Last night champion of violent emotion 
Has canceled a decade of tender devotion

He knows she wonât take him back
No matter how much he begs her
He knows she canât take him back
Aww, he just canât face the fact

Such a way to end
such a tragedy
such a waste, waste

Last night picture of flouted desire 
Is broken, defeated, heâs lost all his fire

He knows she wonât take him back
No matter how much he begs her
He knows she canât take him back
No matter how much he tells her he loves her  

He knows she canât take him back 
Ahh, he just canât face the fact

Yeah, Yeah [X30]
