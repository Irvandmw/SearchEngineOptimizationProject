Lyrics:


Simpson family hardly spoke
With seven kids, it wasn't a joke
Just meeting at night on the sofa
All trying to watch TV

Tucked away in North West Three
Car in the garage, but dad lost the key
So no-one leaves, not even for school
Place is a mess, but the game shows are cool

Someday, they'll get a life
Put away the remote control
Smell the roses 'fore you get old
Hey you, get a life
Turn it off and throw it away
Wake up and walk away

'Cause grandma, granddad, remember the days
Before the one-eyed monster came
Nobody listens as they say all this
Cause everybody's glued

Lunch and dinner in front of the box
Nobody moves, if somebody knocks
Nobody ever hears the phone
Conversation's a memory

Someday, they'll get a life
With the remote control in the bin
Wave to the world you're living in
One day, they'll get a life
But at the moment, it's out of their reach
A life of luxury on the beach

One fine day, a challenge was thrown
By a man at the door in an Escort
"All this could be yours" he said with a grin
Your dream, complete with passport

Challenge was to see, if they could change
TV dinners were all that remained
The men from the game show took the set
Could they survive without it?

Well, mum and dad learned to laugh again
Kids went out and made some friends
All because of the empty space
Standing in the corner

Hey now, they've got a life
Remote control's nowhere to be seen
That's made 'em the dishes clean
Oh yeah, it's a brand new life
So go put on your dancing shoes
Shout it out and spread the news

Oh yeah, it's a brand new life
(Get a brand new life!)
It's out there somewhere
(Don't just settle for second best!)
Oh yeah, a brand new life
(Call now!)
Just waiting for you someplace somewhere
(All this could be yours and more!)
Oh yeah, it's a brand new life
(All you have to do is survive for it!)
It's out there somewhere
(Don't just sit there now!)
Oh yeah, a brand new life
(Get 'em one, just go get 'em one!)
Just waiting for you someplace somewhere
(Apply now! Follow me...)
