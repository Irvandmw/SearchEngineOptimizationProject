Lyrics:


World done finally stand by you
Lookin' in my eyes and you see right through
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
7 in the morning 'cause we just can't sleep (Yeah)
If I'm outta town, know I'm never outta reach (Yeah)
I know that you like it, you don't try and fight it
You wanna ignite it, you go where the night ends

In the dark, in the pain, I feel you (I feel you)
Yeah, in my heart, through the pain, I see you

You're the soul, you're the breath that moves me
Do you really wanna live forever?
I feel that we gonna live forever
Oh-oh-oh...
Do you really wanna live forever?
Oh-oh-oh...
I feel that we gonna live forever

First time I laid my eyes on you
Swear to God, I knew what I had to do
You were sittin' pretty with that hoodie on
All the make-up gone, everything I wanted was you
Tell me why I can't avoid this feeling (Why?)
I don't wanna wake up when you sleeping
Pretty little soul, you love my demons
Say you never leavin', I'm the one you needin', yeah

In the dark, in the pain, I feel you
Yeah, in my heart, through the pain, I see you

You're the soul, you're the breath that moves me
Do you really wanna live forever?
I feel that we gonna live forever
Oh-oh-oh...
Do you really wanna live forever?
Oh-oh-oh...
I feel that we gonna live forever
