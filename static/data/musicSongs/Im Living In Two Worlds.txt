Lyrics:


I'm living in two worlds dividin' my time.
Unhappy In your world and lonesome in mine.

When I'm in your world I just pretend.
That I'm really happy though I don't fit in.
Then I drift in my world so cold and alone.
I'm living in two worlds where do I belong.

I'm living in two worlds dividin' my time.
Unhappy In your world and lonesome in mine.

Old friends in your world are new friends to me.
So I can't take part in your old memory.
Our love shared in two worlds that don't turn the same.
We each have our own worlds and neither can change.

I'm living in two worlds dividin' my time.
Unhappy In yuour world and lonesome in mine. Oh yeah.
