Lyrics:


You can stay all night if you want to
You can hang out with all of his friends
You can go and meet his mother and father
Better make sure that's where it ends

'Cause, baby there's just one thing that you've gotta know

Let him read your palm and guess your sign
Let him take you home and treat you fine
But, baby
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time

'Cause the years flash by in an instant
And you wonder what he's waiting for
Then some skinny bitch walks by in some hot pants
And he's running out the door

So remember that one thing you've gotta know

Let him read your palm and guess your sign
Let him take you home and treat you so fine
But, baby
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time

You ain't getting no younger
And you've got nothing to show
So tell him that it's now or never
And then
Go, go, go, go, go

He can have his space
He can take his time
He can kiss you where the sun don't shine

Oh, baby
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time
