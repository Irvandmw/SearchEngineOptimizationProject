Lyrics:


You're a boy who likes to play games
Drives girls so insane
They only want you to stay bad name
But you don't work that way
You're a boy who breaks the girls' hearts
Don't know what he wants
Should've told you straight from the start
That she will not fall apart

You're not boyfriend material
Got your back up straight against the wall
I'm good girl from the head to the toe
Ha, they think you're serious
Alright, you're kinda sweet
Gonna knock yourself right of the feet
Uh, boy gotta rock the teeth
But you can't stay long
and you gotta breathe
Why don't you just come and take a ride,
Chillin' like an ice bag inside?
Why don't you just come and jump on in?
I don't care if you say don't know to swim!

You're a boy who likes to play games
Drives girls so insane
They only want you to stay bad name
But you don't work that way
You're a boy who breaks the girls' hearts
Don't know what he wants
Should've told you straight from the start
That she will not fall apart

You're not boyfriend material
Got a no IU like really real,
You can come and test me, you can come and try me
I think you might just like me
You know you're kinda cool, 
you just mess around all girls in the school
Uh, boy gotta break the rules
Uh, boy gotta break the rules
Why don't you just come and take a ride,
Chillin' like an ice bag inside?
Why don't you just come and jump on in?
I don't care if you say don't know to swim!

You're a boy who likes to play games
Drives girls so insane
They only want you to stay bad name
But you don't work that way
You're a boy who breaks the girls' hearts
Don't know what he wants
Should've told you straight from the start
That she will not fall apart
