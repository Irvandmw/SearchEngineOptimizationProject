Lyrics:


Seen the skyline in New York City
Fireflies in Tennessee
Sipped a little shine from a paper sack that'll
Knock the horns off a Cadillac
I must've sat on a dozen islands
Watched the sun sink into the sea
Been there, done that, got the t-shirt and hat
But my favorite place to be is

Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time than
Here and now
Everybody's waitin', but they're waiting on what?
Better get to livin', 'cause all we've got is
Here and now

Think I fell in love for the first time
With a girl from Mexico
Thought I found a true love in Malibu but
That water was a little too cold
Yeah, I left a few tears in the rear view
One or two that were hard to forget
Why you think we call the present the present?
'Cause there ain't no better gift than

Here and now
Nowhere else in this world tonight
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time than
Here and now
Everybody's waitin', but they're waiting on what?
Better get to livin', 'cause all we've got is
Here and now

A lotta people dreaming 'bout one-day-some-days
Waiting just around the bend (Waiting just around the bend)
I used to be one wonderin' when they'd come
But now I'm livin' in (But now I'm livin' in)
Here and now
Yeah, I'm livin' in the

Here and now
Nowhere else in this world tonight
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time than
Here and now
Everybody's waitin', but they're waiting on what?
Better get to livin', 'cause all we've got is
Here and now
