Lyrics:


I pray for the best and I run from the past
I pick up the phone just to find Iâm alone
Itâs wearing me out and the weight of my sins
Killed the faith that I had so itâs time I begin
Back to the start just to see how it feels
I was the one that you thought you could heal
Now that itâs over itâs time to move on
'Cause I was the righteous and you were the wrong

Every time I try to run and hide
I feel you're haunting me

Iâm addicted to the games that you play
You make me feel so pitiful
Like youâre so beautiful
Your heart is beating me to death everyday
But I am not that pitiful
Youâre not that beautiful

I suffer inside just to feel Iâm alive
I bury the truth 'cause I know itâs a lie
I never said all the things I should say
'Cause you were the master and I was a slave
If I could find me a drug to forget you
Iâd overdose on the day that I met you
Kill all the drama itâs time to move on
'Cause I am the righteous and you were the wrong

Every time I try to run and hide
I feel you're haunting me

Iâm addicted to the games that you play
You make me feel so pitiful
Like youâre so beautiful
Your heart is beating me to death everyday
But I am not that pitiful
Youâre not that beautiful
Iâm not that pitiful
Youâre not so beautiful

Every time I look into your eyes
I see a demon in disguise
You fucking make me sick
You are the one that I despise
You take me, you break me
You feed me lies
And all that you gave me in return was my demise
So maybe Iâm just crazy for believing this shit
But goddamn I canât believe Iâm fucking dealing with this
Itâs like a nightmare and I canât wake up
I just canât wake up

Iâm addicted to the games that you play
You make me feel so pitiful
Like youâre so beautiful
Your heart is beating me to death everyday
But I am not that pitiful
Youâre not that beautiful
Iâm not that pitiful
Youâre not so beautiful

Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful
