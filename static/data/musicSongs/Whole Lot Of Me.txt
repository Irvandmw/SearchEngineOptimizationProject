Lyrics:


Dum dum dum...

I want you to discover
That with me 
You don't need no other
And if you really wanna know what's doing
All you've got to do is get together
And let's do it!

Baby let me meet you
Come on let me treat you
To a whole lot of me
Baby let me meet you
Come on let me treat you
To a whole lot of me

You're like a mystery to me
Feelings for you steadily run through me
French perfume Chantilly Lace
Chercher La Femme
Oh and I rest my case now

Baby let me meet you
Come on let me treat you
To a whole lot of me
Baby let me meet you
Come on let me treat you
To a whole lot of me

Listen baby, tell me what I can't deny 
When you know that I'm not that type of girl 
We together some ways and now
We're getting tracks to all of your world now 

Ooh...

Don't you want the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me? 
Don't you want the best of all worlds now? 
Are you moved by the air of mystique? 
You and I together forever so unique now

Baby let me meet you 
Come on let me treat you 
To a whole lot of me 
Baby let me meet you 
Come on let me treat you 
To a whole lot of me 

Ooh...

Baby baby, my baby 
Sugar baby, my baby
Baby baby, oh baby
Sugar baby, sweet baby
You are my sweetie
Ooh baby
Ooh I need you, sweet baby
Baby baby...
