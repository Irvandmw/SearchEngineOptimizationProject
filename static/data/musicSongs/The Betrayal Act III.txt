Lyrics:


Table has been set
Serving of the worst regret
Waiting for the chance
Serpents love the circumstance
Speaking to the sky
Slight of hand in cheap disguise
Naming of your price
Payment for the sacrifice

Demon in your ear
Evil on your breath
You brought the wolves right here
You brought the kiss of death

You just betrayed him (you just betrayed)
The moment we've all been waiting on
No one can save him (no one can save)
You won't believe until he's gone
Go on, go on
Your noose is waiting (no need to wait)
Go on, go on
You just betrayed him (you just betrayed)

Committed to your task
Jealousy behind your mask
Pieces are in place
Thirty for your last disgrace
Holding of your tongue
Dealings that can't be undone
Blood over your hands
Pawn inside the master plan

Demon in your ear
Evil on your breath
You brought the wolves right here
You brought the kiss of death

You just betrayed him (you just betrayed)
The moment we've all been waiting on
No one can save him (no one can save)
You won't believe until he's gone
Go on, go on
Your noose is waiting (no need to wait)
Go on, go on
You just betrayed him (you just betrayed)

What have you gained? What have you done?
Nothing but shame and there's nowhere to run
Who takes the blame? Why have they come?
What in God's name have you done?

You just betrayed him (you just betrayed)
The moment we've all been waiting on
No one can save him (no one can save)
You won't believe until he's gone
Go on, go on
Your noose is waiting (no need to wait)
Go on, go on
You just betrayed him (you just betrayed)

You just betrayed
You just betrayed
You just betrayed
