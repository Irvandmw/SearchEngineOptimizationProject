Lyrics:


Some secrets need to be kept
Some stories should never be told
Some reasons shouldn't be understood
They just might turn your blood cold

Who needs all the answers?
Who takes all the chances?
Who said the truth's gonna save you?
When the truth can be dangerous

Like the way I feel
It's alright to steal
What I need from you
Do what I have to do
Say what I have to say
Go where I have to go
And that's dangerous
Dangerous to know

I was a law onto myself
When you found me out on my own
Together nothing was sacred
Together we where alone

Who needs all the questions?
Who lost their direction?
Who said a lie's gonna break you?
When a lie could be dangerous

Like the way I feel
It's alright to steal
What I need from you
Do what I have to do
Say what I have to say
Go where I have to go
And that's dangerous
Dangerous to know

Ignorance is bliss
You're safe when you resist
There's no safety in a kiss like this
It's dangerous
So kiss me
Kiss me

Like the way I feel
It's alright to steal
What I need from
Do what I have to do
Say what I have to say
Go where I have to go
And that's dangerous
Dangerous
Like the way I feel
It's alright to steal
What I need from
Do what I have to do
Say what I have to say
Go where I have to go
And that's dangerous
Dangerous to know

Some secrets need to be kept
