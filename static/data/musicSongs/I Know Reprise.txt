Lyrics:


No more war? It's not gonna happen
Not while there's men
willing to fight in them

No more war? It's not gonna happen
Not while there's patriotism,
Not while there's patriotism,

No more war? It's not gonna happen
Not while there's some saying
That this is the last one,

No more war? It's not gonna happen
Not while religious nuts
Are willing to spill their guts
