Lyrics:


If you could come clean about everything
It would be easy for me to be sorry.
If you could see all the possibilities
We might not still be standing where we started.

Oh, no.
Don't let me go for this,
Don't let me go for this.

I might be a fool, but you might be one too.
Maybe we're all that we needed.
Two wrongs don't make a right,
But I don't care tonight.
Maybe we're all that we needed

You could say we were just a big mistake.
I think it's worth making,
Worth repeating.
I would say good things come to those who wait.
I would say anything if you'd believe it.

Oh, no.
Don't let me go for this,
Don't let me go for this.

I might be a fool, but you might be one too.
Maybe we're all that we needed.
Two wrongs don't make a right,
But I don't care tonight.
Maybe we're all that we needed.

Maybe we're perfectly not meant to be,
Or more alike than we're willing to see.
Maybe we're not meant to not disagree.
Maybe we're crazy, baby.

If you could come clean about everything
It would be easy for me to be sorry.
If you could see all the possibilities
We might not still be standing where we started.

Oh, no.
Don't let me go for this,
Don't let me go for this.

I might be a fool, but you might be one too.
Maybe we're all that we needed.
Two wrongs don't make a right,
But I don't care tonight.
Maybe we're all that we needed.

I don't care tonight.
Maybe we're all that we needed.

I don't care tonight.
Maybe we're all that we needed
