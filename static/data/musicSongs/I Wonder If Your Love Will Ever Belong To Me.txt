Lyrics:


Well I wonder if you're love will ever belong to me
Well a voice from deep within keeps talkin'
And it's tellin' me
That a girl with such a heart
Can only tear my dreams apart
But I love you dear
And I don't care what it says

That same little voice within my heart
Says to find another love
How can I my dear
When I know it's only you I love
And I don't believe a word
Not a single thing I've heard
And my love is yours until my dying day

Someday when you're really mine
Then I'll say to you it's you I really love
And somehow, oh I'll make you mine
Then you'll cling to me
Just like a girl in love

That same little voice within my heart
Says to find another love
How can I my dear
When I know it's only you I love
And I don't believe a word
Not a single thing I've heard
And my love is yours until my dying day

Well I wonder if your love will ever belong to me
Well I wonder if your love will ever belong to me
Well I wonder if your love will ever belong to me
Well I wonder if your love will ever belong to me
