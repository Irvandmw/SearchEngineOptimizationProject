Lyrics:


Right now I feel just like a leaf on a breeze
Who knows where it's blowin'
Who knows where it's goin'

I find myself somewhere IâI never thought I'd be
I'm going 'round in circles
Thinking about you and me

And how do I explain it when I don't know what to say
What do I do now? So much has changed

Nothing I have ever known has made me feel this way
Nothing I have ever seen has made me wanna stay
But here I am, ready for you
I'm turnin'
I'm fallin'
I hear my home callin'

Hey, I've never felt something so strong
Oh no
It's like nothing I've ever known

Now you're the one I'm looking for
You're the one I need
You're the one that gives me a reason to believe

Following a star
Has lead to where you are
It feels so strong now
This can't be wrong now

Nothing I have ever known has made me feel this way
Nothing I have ever seen has made me wanna stay
But here I am, ready for you
I'm turnin'
I'm fallin'
I hear my home callin'

Hey, I've never felt something so strong
Oh no
It's like nothing I've ever known

It's like nothing I've ever known

Right now I feel like a leaf on a breeze
Who knows where it's blowing
Who knows where I'm going
