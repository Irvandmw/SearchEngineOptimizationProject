Lyrics:


The pattern is broken, the pieces don't fit.
Pull them apart and move them a bit.
See what you've made and see who you are.
The plans that you've laid can go just so far.
Before the pattern get's broken, the pieces don't fit.
Pull them apart and move them a bit.
See what you've made and see who you are.
The plans that you've laid can go just so far.

Then it's the end of sunny weather.
When all the pieces fit together.
And it looks like the final ending.
But it's really the beginning.
And though the pieces are apart now.
And you got a broken heart now.
Someday the sun is gonna shine on a fabulous design,
That only you can see. Ahhhh.

But then the pattern get's broken, the pieces don't fit.
Pull them apart and move them a bit.
See what you've made and see who you are.
The plans that you've laid can go just so far.
Before the pattern get's broken, the pieces don't fit.
(The pattern's broken and the pieces don't fit)
Pull them apart and move them a bit.
(Pull them apart and then move them a bit)
See what you've made and see who you are.
(See what you've made and see who you are)
The plans that you've laid can go just so far.
(The plans you've laid will only go just so far)
Before the pattern get's broken, the pieces don't fit.
(The pattern's broken and the pieces don't fit)
Pull them apart and move them a bit.
(Pull them apart and then move them a bit)
See what you've made and see who you are.
(See what you've made and see who you are)
The plans that you've laid can go just so far.
(The plans you've laid will only go just so far)

Ahhh, ahaha, ahhh, ahaha, ahhhhhhhh, ahhha...
