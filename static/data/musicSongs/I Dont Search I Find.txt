Lyrics:


Finally, enough love

I don't search, I find
I don't search, I find

I found love
I found something new
I found you
Yeah, I found you
Platinum gold, inside your soul
I found light, I found emotion

I don't search, I don't search
I don't search, I find

It's our gypsy blood
We live between life and death
Waiting to move on
And in the end
We accept it
We shake hands with our fate
And we walk past
There's no rest for us in this world
Finally enough love

I don't search, I find

I found peace (I found peace)
I found a new view (I found a new view)
I found you (I found you)
Yeah, I found you (I found you)

(Platinum gold) I don't search, I find (Inside your soul)
(Inside your soul) I don't search, I find (Inside your soul)

Finally, enough love
Finally, enough love
(Finally, enough love) Yeah, it's coming (Inside your soul)
Finally, enough love (Inside your soul)
(Finally, enough love) Yeah, it's coming (Inside your soul)
(Finally, enough love) Yeah, it's coming (Inside your soul)
(Inside your soul)
Finally, enough love
