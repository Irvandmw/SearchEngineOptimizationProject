Lyrics:


No, I'm not 20 anymore
Don't try to make me feel insecure
'Cause if one things for sure
I don't wanna be

I feel so good in my skin (Skin)
Should I let you go?
Should I let you in?
Oh, baby don't need no one to show me what to do, yeah

Beauty's more than a number
When I was younger I didn't know that
And if you gave me the chance
I wouldn't go back (Back, back)

No, I'm not 20 anymore (20 anymore)
Don't try to make me feel insecure
'Cause I'm agin' like wine
I get better with time, yes I do (Yes I do)

And no, I'm not 20 anymore (20 anymore)
The lines on my face, they weren't there before
But I'm wiser, I'm stronger
From all of the life I've been through (I've been through)
Oh and if one thing's for sure
I don't wanna be 20 anymore

Why lie 'bout how old I am?
When I'm a better lover
Than I was in 2010
Oh, baby, let me show you all the things my body do, yeah

Beauty's more than a number
When I was younger, wish I knew that
And now I'm not afraid
Won't hold myself back (Back, back)

No, I'm not 20 anymore (20 anymore)
Don't try to make me feel insecure
'Cause I'm agin' like wine
I get better with time, yes I do (Yes I do)

And no, I'm not 20 anymore (20 anymore)
The lines on my face, they weren't there before
But I'm wiser, I'm stronger
From all of the life I've been through (I've been through)
Oh and if one thing's for sure
I don't wanna be 20 anymore
