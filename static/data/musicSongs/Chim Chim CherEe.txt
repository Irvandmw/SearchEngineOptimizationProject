Lyrics:


Chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim-in-ey

Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-ee!
A sweep is as lucky, as lucky can be
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-oo!
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

Or blow me a kiss and thatâs lucky too

Chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim-in-ey

Now, as the ladder of life has been strung
You may think a sweepâs on the bottommost rung
Though I spend my time in the ashes and that hm-hmm
In this whole wide world thereâs no happier cat

Chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim-in-ey

I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do
A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flute
Though Iâm covered in soot from my head to my toe
A sweep knows heâs welcome whereâer he goes

Chim chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim chim-in-ey

Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-ee!
âen youâre with a sweep, youâre in good comâany
Nowhere thereâs a more happy crew
Than them that sings chim cham chim cher-oo

Chim-in-ey chim-ee cher-oo chim-cher-ee!

Chim chim chim chim-in-ey [repeated]
