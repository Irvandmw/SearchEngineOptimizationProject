Lyrics:


It was in the spring, one sunny day
My sweetheart left me, Lord, she went away
And now she's gone and I don't worry
For I'm sitting on top of the world

Mississippi river is deep and wide
My sweetheart's living on the other side
Now she's gone and I don't worry
For I'm sitting on top of the world

You don't like my peaches, don't you shake my tree
Get out of my orchard, let my peaches be
Now she's gone and I don't worry
For I'm sitting on top of the world

Now she's gone and I don't worry
For I'm sitting on top of the world
