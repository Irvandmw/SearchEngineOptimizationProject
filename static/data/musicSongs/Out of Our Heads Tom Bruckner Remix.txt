Lyrics:


Two more fall to the ways of love
With my respect for the man above
Sympathies mine remaining your state
Out of our heads and back again
I'm losing no time for the things I'm told
Ask for silence, let the world explode
Listen to it take away
Out of our heads and back again

Two more fall to the ways of love
With my respect for the man above
Sympathies mine concerning your state
Out of our heads and back again
I'm losing no time for the things I'm told
Ask for silence, let the world explode
Listen to it take away
Out of our heads and back again

Back again
Back again

Two more fall to the ways of love
With my respect for the man above
Sympathies mine concerning your state
Out of our heads and back again
I'm losing no time for the things I'm told
Ask for silence, let the world explode
Listen to it take away
Out of our heads and back again

Back again
Back again again again again
Back again
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Mhmmm
Mhmmm

I have no wish to see you bleed
I'll sacrifice your life for me
Still you lock yourself in chains
Out of our heads and back again
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Our love makes way for untold lust
Concede, our lives can't wait
Out of our heads and back again

Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and

Who am I to add lust
I couldn't let you down
The words of sense are hanging on
Leave you shivering on the ground

Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
