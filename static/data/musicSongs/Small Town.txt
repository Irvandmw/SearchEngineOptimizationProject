Lyrics:


I heard a place not too far from here
Is handing out answers
About why we are here
And it's a small town in a small world
And the congregation's small too
But somehow I think they're telling the truth

And in the same small town there is a girl
She's a good looker but she's mad at the world
And she's wondering about tomorrow and why she's here
She's sick and tired of using her sleeves to wipe her tears

And oh oh,
You can tell by the look that's in her eyes
She's not that well
She's wishing someone would close their eyes
And picture this for just a moment to theirselves

And oh, at least that's what they say [x5]

She sits alone
She's a re-run queen
The sun shines through her window
Enough to make out her figurine
The neighbours look at her strange
'Cos she's lived there her whole life
And they still don't know her name
She likes to keep to herself
'Cos she can't find nobody else

And oh oh,
You can tell by the look that's in her eyes
She's not that well
She's wishing someone would close their eyes
And picture this for just a moment to theirselves

And oh, at least that's what they say, yeah
That's what they say [x2]
And oh, at least that's what they say, yeah

What they say [x4]
I don't care
What they say [x4]
I don't care 
What they say [x4]
I don't care
Nooo....

She wanders through the town
To find this place she's heard about
Thinking maybe they can figure out what's wrong
And oh, they greet her with a smile
Saying they've been waiting for quite some while
Just to let her know she's worth more than she's ever dreamed of

And her heart opens wide
And for the first time in her life 
She feels the touch of Jesus deep inside
And oh, she wonders what went wrong
In a town where nothing's going on
And thinks of all the others that she knows

And she said [x9]
Wanna leave out her name [x7]
Nooo [x7]

She wanders through the town
To find this place she's heard about
Thinking maybe they can figure out what's wrong
And oh, they greet her with a smile
Saying they've been waiting for quite some while
Just to let her know she's worth more than she's ever dreamed of
