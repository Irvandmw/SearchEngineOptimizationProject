Lyrics:


She was gone,
Long gone this morning,
She left a note
Said I'm out of here adios my dear
And that was all she wrote

I tried to hang but the Hank wasn't tough enough
Couldn't twang the pain with the Flatt & Scruggs
Had to keep on drinking,
Keep on sinking down, down,
Down, down, down to the good stuff

'Til I hit rock bottom, and I cranked it up
I hit that water back with a Marshall stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt

Got a Cali chick, checking out this hick
Spinning that Back In Black
I hit rock bottom,
Started bouncing back
Started bouncing back,

She's flying high tonight,
Just across town
This ole hillbilly playing Stardust Willy
Wasn't even getting off the ground

Tried to hang with the Hank but I had to stop
Got sad when the J Cash needle dropped
Couldn't walk the line
So I just kept shining down, down
Down, down, down that juke box

'Til I hit rock bottom, and I cranked it up
I hit that water back with a Marshall stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt

Got a Cali chick, checking out this hick
Spinning that Back In Black
I hit rock bottom,
Started bouncing back

'Til I hit rock bottom, and I cranked it up
I hit that water back with a Marshall stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt

Got a Cali chick, checking out this hick
Spinning that Back In Black
I hit rock bottom
Started bouncing back
Started bouncing back
