Lyrics:


If you ever ever leave me
Life will go on
Stars will still be
Bright as diamonds
In the sky now
Even if you said goodbye now

Oh, the clock wouldn't stop, no
That sun would still keep shining down
But darling
This world would still be spinnin' 'round
But, baby, there would be

Just no living without loving you
How would I ever survive?
Just no living without loving you
It would be like living without being alive
Without you
Without you, baby

If you ever walk out this door
What would I have left to live for?
What would there be left to do now?
What would I be without you now?

Oh, the clock wouldn't stop, no
Each day would go on just the same
Darling
It wouldn't stop the sun and rain
But, baby, there would be

Just no living without loving you
How would I ever survive?
Just no living without loving you
It would be like living without being alive
(Just no living without loving you)
Without you
Without you, baby

(Just no living without loving you)
Without you
There's no living without loving you
Oh, baby, in my life
(Just no living without loving you)
It just stopped the rain
Oh, baby

Oh, the clock wouldn't stop, no

But, baby, there would be

Just no living without loving you
How would I ever survive?
Just no living without loving you
It would be like living without being alive
Without you
(Just no living without loving you)
Without you, baby
(Just no living without loving you)

It would be like living without being alive
Without you
(Just no living without loving you)
Oh, yes, baby

There's no living without loving you
There's no living without loving you
(Just no living without loving you)
There's no living

(Just no living without loving you)
How could I ever survive, baby?
There's no living without loving you
(Just no living without loving you)
There's no living without loving you

There's no living without loving you
(Just no living without loving you)
There's no living without loving you
There's no living without loving you
