Lyrics:


Baby, I think I'm crazy over you
Give the stars and the moon and I know that you would too
My eyes begin to widen when you walk in the room
My face lights up and it's apparent that I'm falling for you

Tangled in a nest deep down in your heart
I'm breathing through your lungs, want to spend this time apart
And I don't want to start

Baby, I know I'm crazy over you
I'd give you the world and you're the only one I'd give it to
Don't break my promise and I'm aware that neither will you
Pinky promised on forever and forever is what I shall do

Tangled in a nest deep down in your heart
I'm breathing through your lungs, want to spend this time apart
And I don't want to start
I don't want to start

Don't break my promise and I'm aware that neither will you
Pinky promised on forever and forever is what I shall do
