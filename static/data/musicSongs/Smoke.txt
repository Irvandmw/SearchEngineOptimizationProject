Lyrics:


Too petty, his little girl, you've gone so far
Keep begging until you're smiling, you're a movie star
Songs from the '50s your mom's used to sing
Oh, in the kitchen while she's making dinner for your family

Keep dreaming, baby girl, keep your head up high
Waiting for your mama to sing lullabies
Well daddy isn't here and mama's smoking stacks
Oh, headaches from the smoke you smell ain't getting wrecked

Closer to encourage and I'll be awake
Sing yourself to sleep learn how to be afraid
All you have is God, always a rivalry
While your lungs are filled with all the smoke you breathe

Don't you worry now you sleep you little thing
Daddy will come back and therefore he will sing
Sing your precious lullaby to you he will
While mama smokes her cancer 'til the dawn still

Closer to encourage and I'll be awake
Sing yourself to sleep learn how to be afraid
All you have is God, always a rivalry
While your lungs are filled with all the smoke you breathe

Closer to encourage and I'll be awake
Sing yourself to sleep learn how to be afraid
All you have is God, always a rivalry
While your lungs are filled with all the smoke you breathe
