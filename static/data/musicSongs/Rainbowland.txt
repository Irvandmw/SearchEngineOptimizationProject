Lyrics:


[Dolly Parton:]
Hey, Miley
It's me, I'm in Nashville
I'm on my way to Dollywood, busy as you are
Can't get enough stuff to do, can't
But anyway, I'm excited about singing with you
So I'm just gonna turn my CD player on with you singing
I'm gon' put this on a cassette
Sing along with it, and then I'll run you off a CD later
Oh, I'm so high tech
I got a flip phone too
But anyhow, see what you think
And mmm, here I go
Come on

[Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton:]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where everything goes as planned and I smile
'Cause I know if we tried, we could really make a difference in this world
I won't give up or sleep a wink
It's the only thought I think
You know where I stand
I believe we can start livin' in a rainbowland

Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' (I'd be lyin'), if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here (hate going on here)
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland

Living in a rainbowland
Where skies are blue and things are grand
Oh, wouldn't it be nice to live in paradise
Where we're free to be exactly who we are
Let's all dig down deep inside
Brush the judgement and fear aside
Make wrong things right (all things right), and end the fight
'Cause I promise ain't nobody gonna win
(C'mon)

Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' (I'd be lyin'), if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here (hate going on here)
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland

Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand together (let's do it together)
Change things forever (forever)
I know there's got to be a greener plan
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through (shine my head)
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland

[Dolly Parton:]
Hey, Miley
Look, I know it sounds scrambled when I'm singing it with you
But [?] do a little bit better
At least, I may not get it all the way through
'Cause I'm not sure of the structure without you
But I think this could work well, don't you?
If not, like I said
I'll write that love song for you
You probably wrote it about some boy you loved, didn't you?
Well...
