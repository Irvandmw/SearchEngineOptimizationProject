Lyrics:


Look at the boy in the kitty kat shirt,
He might be good looking, but he still can't flirt.
Look at the girl in the really tight shirt,
She might be good looking, but her back really hurts.

The boy to the girl, says hello
And asks her if she wants to go the show.

The girl tells the boy, okay it's a date,
Now pick me up at seven and don't be late.

Well I don't know just whatcha wanna do about it.
Been trying hard not to talk about it.
I'd only know what you want to do
At all. at all. at all.
Let's talk about it.

The girl gets ready in her best party dress,
She looks at the boy and she seems disinterested.

She says, by the way, who we going to see?
He says, don't you know, its the plain white t's.

(man, I love those guys!)

Well I don't know just whatcha wanna do about it.
Been trying hard not to talk about it.
I'd only know what you want to do
Well I don't know just whatcha wanna do about it.
Been trying hard not to talk about it.
I'd only know what you want to do
At all.
At all.
Let's talk about it.
