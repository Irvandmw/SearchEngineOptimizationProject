Lyrics:


[Future:]
Chandelier diamonds champagne
I'm fillin' my cup up with good drank
I know these drugs could be good [?]
I fell in love like a new fragrance
New kids on the block I'm sensei
Hold the candles high in your memory
Spin the block and let it rain get it done, done
I'm the man, I'm the man like Mister Dun Dun
Its blood or die me and Guwop
I spent a house on my new drop
Pearls in your eyes ain't no shades for you
I'm hidin' money I dig the grave for it

I just wanted to leave with all shooters
I just left the club with all shooters
I became the plug got all shooters
I get molly percocets to all the shooters
Northside, Eastside, Westside, Southside, all shooters
If you represent the set, all shooters
You was raised up in the six, all shooters
Went to Paris for my niggas all shooters

[Gucci Mane:]
They say keys open doors well niggas bells get your keys
Take them keys out the door cause nigga 12 'bout to leave
See I'm a give 'em hell a half a mil' on my sleeve
I bet she tryna clean that pussy up to sell it to me
I have so so many piece that you can't sell that to me
See you talk a real good game but you can't tell that to me
I'm in the penthouse with some shooters in the room next to me
Got a Draco with my trick look like a broom next to me
And I'm higher than a kite feel like scrooms off of me
I turn your girlfriend to a mule she like balloons up in me
He can't see his momma strung out he refusin' to see
How you a G hanging with snitches that's confusin' to me

[Future:]
I just wanted to leave with all shooters
I just left the club with all shooters
I became the plug got all shooters
I get molly percocets to all the shooters
I fell in love like a new fragrance
Its blood or die me and Guwop
I spent a house or my new drop
Northside, Eastside, Westside, Southside, all shooters
