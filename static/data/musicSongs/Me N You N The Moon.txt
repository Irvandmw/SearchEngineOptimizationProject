Lyrics:


(Me 'n you 'n the moon
We two 'n the moon)

We don't need to swing in a hammock
We don't need the nightengale's tune
All we need to get going
Is me 'n you 'n the moon

We don't need a heavenly setting
We don't need a sleepy lagoon
All we need to get going
Is me 'n you 'n the moon

Just the three of us
What a situation
Just the three of us
Plus a natural inclination

We don't need a flowery season
Love is love December or June
We can make our own weather
Just put us together
Me 'n you 'n the moon

(We don't need a comfortable parlor
We don't need the nightengale's tune
All we need to get going
Is you 'n me 'n the moon We don't need a horse and a buggy
Buggy rides are over too soon
All we need to get going
Is me 'n you 'n the moon)

Just the three of us
What a situation
Just the three of us
Plus the natural inclination

We don't need a flowery season
Love is love December or June
We can make our own weather
Just put us together
Me 'n you 'n the moon
