Lyrics:


(Oh)
I know (Yeah)
That it's taken me all this time to say, girl (Yeah)
I'm slow (Yeah)
So it's taken me all this time to say, girl (Yeah)
Tip toe (Yeah)
And I want to acknowledge my mistake, girl (Oh yeah)
Uh-oh (Yeah)
And I hope that you know it's not too late (Oh yeah)

Baby, you beautiful the way that you are
The way my mama raised me, I can't even lie to your heart
How could I just look you in the face and say you're nothing more than perfect?
How could I?
I ain't stupid (No, no), I can't do it (No, no)
No, I tell the truth, look what you done to me
Set me free, I ain't tryna be annoying
No, I but if you let me
Put it on you
Round one, round two
Three more, then four, five

I know, but it's taken me all this time to say, ooh
I'm so (Huh) sorry it's taken me all this time to say, ooh-wee
Tip toe
And I know that we all might make mistakes
Don't trip, no, no
Give me a minute, you know it's not too late
Let's smoke

I'ma let you decide, if you wanna ride or drive
This song for you, babe (Huh)
How you wanna play it? (Ow!)
And if you already started
And you don't run from this dick
Shake something, make loving, look what we got
I'm thankful for you (Ha)
Can't no bitch in here take your spot (No, no, no)
You're the right one, I thank a lot
You the right one, baby, gotta keep it real
'Cause you're the real deal

I know, but it's taken me all this time to say, ooh (All this time to say)
I'm so (Huh) sorry it's taken me all this time to say, ooh-wee (Oh)
Tip toe (No)
And I know that we all might make mistakes
Don't trip, no, no
Give me a minute, you know it's not too late (Ooh)
Let's smoke

I ain't gotta have the drugs on me
Got the love on me
Fuck you in the shower, if you do, take the glove off me
Just like Mike, moon-walkin'
You don't need no thug talk
Rich like ooh, act a fool
Baby, this that Blood walk
I go first, you prefer
If I take my shirt off
Make it squirt
I'm the worst
Baby, take your skirt off
Pull your hair, double dare
Kiss on it just how you want it
Panties, throw 'em over here
God really broke the mold
Took his time with them breasteses and the waist line
Really with the shit, not a kid, this ain't play time
I don't fuck with FaceTime, I don't waste time
Just pop it to the bassline, I'ma take mine

I know, but it's taken me all this time to say, ooh
I'm so sorry it's taken me all this time to say, ooh-wee
Tip toe
And I know that we all might make mistakes
Don't trip, no, no
Give me a minute, you know it's not too late
Let's smoke
