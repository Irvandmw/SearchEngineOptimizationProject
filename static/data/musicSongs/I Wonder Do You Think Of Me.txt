Lyrics:


If you drive around
Back in our old hometown
I wonder do you think of me
When you drive by a school
Do you remember two fools
I wonder do you think of me

And remember the park
Where you struck the spark
To a fire thatâs still burning
A hole in my heart
Then on graduation day
You just drifted away
I wonder do you think of me

And remember those games
Those cold football games
I was your hero
Though I seldom played
Back then could you see
What our future would be
I wonder do you think of me

And the classes we missed
Caused by a kiss
I can tell you that Iâve never
Felt like that since
I donât know if you would
But Iâd go back if I could
I wonder do you think of me
I still love you
Do you think of me
