Lyrics:


This is the story  
'bout Perry who came home  
late one night! 
Must have been about a  
two or three am,  
something like that! 
Gotta get me some sleep,  
he yawned as he turned out the light! 
Haaw!  
I guess I was too tired to do any reading! 
Whether he dreamed what happened,  
or if he really heard it,  
he wouldn't bet 
but he swears it sounded like two cats  
singin' a duet! 
Come y'out, come y'out, come y'out my pretty kitten  
This is me, your boyfriend "Tom" (N'yot N'yow!) 
Ah! come y'out, come y'out, come y'out my pretty kitten  
This is old Tom, "Tom" the atom-bomb! (N'yot N'yow!) 
We assure you we'd come y'out  

if only we knew how 
They tell us that you really are  
the cat's "MEOW"! 
Ah! come y'out, come y'out, come y'out my pretty kitten  
Now? (N'yot N'yow!) Oh! 
Come y'out, come y'out,  
come y'out our croonin' kitten  
We will serenade the moon! N'yot N'yow! 
Come y'out, come y'out,  
come y'out our little kitten  
We will sing a little tune! N'yot N'yow! 
When the folks got home tonight at twelve or thereabout 
They locked the door and they forgot to put me-owt!  
Oowah! "Alone from night to night you'll find me!" 
Come y'out, come y'out,  
come y'out our croonin' kitten  
Mee-owh! Heh heh  
OK, now!
