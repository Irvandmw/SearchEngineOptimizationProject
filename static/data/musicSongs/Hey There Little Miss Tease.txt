Lyrics:


Hey there little miss tease
You got me weak in the knees
Wonderin' if you really care for me
Well ya don't say no, ya don't say yes
Ya always make me guess
Please put my heart at ease, little miss tease

There's a cold, cold wind tonight
And I long to hold you tight
So come and warm my heart I beg you please
Well please be true, say you long to hold me too
My lips are gonna freeze, little miss tease

Well one day, you're so mad about me
And I'm a happy guy
The next day ya get along without me
Please tell me why, why

Hey there little miss tease
You got me weak in the knees
I'm so mixed up and full of misery
Well don't say no, please say yes
Give our love a test
I only wanna please, little miss tease

Well one day, you're so mad about me
And I'm a happy guy
The next day ya get along without me
Please tell me why, why

Hey there little miss tease
You got me weak in the knees
I'm so mixed up and full of misery
Well don't say no, please say yes
Give our love a test
I only wanna please, little miss tease
Well I only wanna please, little miss tease
Well I only wanna please, little miss tease
Well I only wanna please, little miss tease
