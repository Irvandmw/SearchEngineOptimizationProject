Lyrics:


Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
My dear, itâs true
Youâre trouble just like me
Weâre black, and blue
And in love with misery.
But you can have my darkness
You can have my black dress
Take away my emo
I donât really need this
Iâm getting in my own way
Getting high on heartbreak
And all the shit that you say
Itâs making my world all grey

[Hook:]
I donât wanna stay here
Cause everyday it rains here
Underneath the clear blue sky
Even though itâs summer
All I hear is thunder
Underneath this clear blue sky

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Donât blame, yourself
I let you drag me down
But this place, is hell
I finally see that now
So you can have my dark clouds
Gotta let my hurt down
Take away my emo
I think Iâve had enough now
Of getting in my own way
And getting high on heartbreak
And all the shit that you say
Itâs making my world all grey

[Hook]

[Bridge]
But Iâm not saying Iâm gonna start going to church
Not saying that I'll show up early to work
Just saying for once Iâm putting myself first
Putting myself first, putting myself first
So I'm leaving this town for good,
Gotta gotta get out of this neighborhood
Just like you never ever thought I could,
Never thought I could, never thought that

[Hook]
