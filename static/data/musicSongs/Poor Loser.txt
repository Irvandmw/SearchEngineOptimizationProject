Lyrics:


Why did you have to take my heart and break it
Why did you run away with someone new
Everybody know's I'm strong but I just can't take it
'Cause I'm a poor loser when it comes to losing you

If I were a king and I lost my riches
I know that it wouldn't break my heart in two
Now my hearts in little bitty pieces
'Cause I'm a poor loser when it comes to losing you

Many people lose, some are winners
So I'm left to face this world alone
This is not a game for beginners
But you were the very first love I've ever known

I know I shouldn't let you see me crying
But I feel so bad that I don't know what to do
I guess I'll hide my tears and keep on trying
'Cause I'm a poor loser when it comes to losing you

Many people lose, some are winners
So I'm left to face this world alone
This is not a game for beginners
But you were the very first love I've ever known

I know I shouldn't let you see me crying
But I feel so bad that I don't know what to do
I guess I'll hide my tears and keep on trying
'Cause I'm a poor loser when it comes to losing you
Yes I'm a poor loser when it comes to losing you
Well I'm a poor loser when it comes to losing you
