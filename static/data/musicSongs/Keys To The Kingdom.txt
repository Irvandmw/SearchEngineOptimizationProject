[Tiwa Savage:]
The other sun and the moon bow for you
But you won't open your eyes
Omo oba, ma gbagbe
Ranti Oruko Baba e
Oh

Tick tock, pretty baby
You can get it back, don't you waste it
To grow from your past, gotta face it
Oh yeah
(You're the key to the kingdom)

Oh, you are the remedy, don't know what's inside
But you're the key to the kingdom
You're the key to the kingdom
Oh, so believe
Even if you can't see, I'll never leave
'Cause you're the key to the kingdom
You're the key to the kingdom

Here some things you have to know
It go hard from have to grow
When you feel you've had enough
You gotta breathe
Just remember who you are
You forget, look to the stars
Even the strong, yeah, the weak
But you're the key, you're the key

Tick tock, pretty baby
You can get it back, don't you waste it
To grow from your past, gotta face it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Tick tock, pretty baby (Tick tock, pretty baby)
You can get it back, don't you waste it (Get it back, don't you waste it)
To grow from your past, gotta face it
Oh yeah
(You're the key to the kingdom)

Oh, you're rather empty, don't know what's inside
But you're the key to the kingdom
You're the key to the kingdom
Oh, so believe
Even if you can't see, I'll never leave
'Cause you're the key to the kingdom
You're the key to the kingdom
