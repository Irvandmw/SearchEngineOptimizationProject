Lyrics:


Escucha el ritmo de tu corazon
Feel the Rhythm

From the coast of Ipanema
To the Island of Capri
All the way to Kuala Lumpur
I will follow you wherever you may be

From the moment, I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free
Had to hold you in my arms
There can never be another for me

All I need is the rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes
Viva la musica
Say you'll be mine

Can you feel the heat of passion
Can you taste our love's sweet wine
Join the dance and let it happen
Put tomorrow's cares right out of your mind
As the music draws you closer
And you fall under my spell
I will catch you In my arms now
Where the night can take us no one can tell

All I need is the rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine
All I need is the look in your eyes
Viva la musica
Say you'll be mine

Gotta have this feeling forever
Gotta live this moment together
Nothing else matters
Just you and the night
Follow on the wings of desire
Now the rhythm is taking you higher
No one can stop us from havin' it all
You are my heart, you are my soul

[2x]
All I need is the rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine
All I need is the look in your eyes
Viva la musica
Say you'll be mine

[4x]
Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Burning .....Burning
