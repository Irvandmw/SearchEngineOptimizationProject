Lyrics:


Coming with the quickness
As you hid below the bows
But I don't even feel it anymore 
Guess I have a new sound
Can't you see it's cold now 
Everywhere we go now

I just wanna go home now
Just let me go home now
I wanna go home now
Just let me go home now
I wanna go home now
Just let me go home

I don't even care for you
You don't seem to care for me
So why do we go on like this?
Can't you see it's killing me
Every time we talk now
We're only lying to ourselves

I just wanna go home now
Just let me go home now
I wanna go home now
Just let me go home now
I wanna go home now
Just let me go home

Coming with the quickness
As you hid below the bows
But I don't even feel it anymore 
Guess I have a new sound
Can't you see it's cold now
Everywhere we go now

I just wanna go home now
Just let me go home now
I wanna go home now
Just let me go home now
I wanna go home now
Just let me go home now
I wanna go home now
Just let me go home now
I wanna see my friends now
Just let me be alone now
I just wanna be alive now
Just let me live my life now
Just let me go home now
Just let me go home now
I wanna go home
