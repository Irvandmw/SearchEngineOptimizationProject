Lyrics:


Do you recall that night in June when first we met? 
Do you remember Love the words we spoke? 
Have you forgotten all the tender vows we made 
in the silent magical moonbeams light? 

Gone are the golden dreams  
with summer roses, 
And all of our tender-est vows  
were made but to be broken . . . 

Song of songs,  
Song of memory, 
and broken melody of love and life  
nevermore to me  
can that melody  
fill the heart  
with the joy once it knew . . . 

Oh night of bliss, night of June and love  
beneath the stars amid the roses . . . 
Oh dream of delight that faded at dawn  
Oh song of songs,  
Oh night of bliss,  
When you were my whole world of love! 

[instrumental break]

When you were my whole world of love . . . 
Of love!
