Lyrics:


From the minute that you walked right through the door 
Thoughts are racing in my mind, time to explore 
I tell my friends that I just gotta have him 
Don't look now, cause I see you staring at him 

Tunnel vision had him locked on in my sight 
On a mission, for position by the end of the night 
Itâs like a prey, playin' games with the hunter 
You better run boy, time to surrender 

And all I need is to feel you 
All I want is to feel you 

[CHORUS:]
Reach out and touch me 
Before I go insane 
Reach out and touch me 
Boy don't you make me wait 
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money 
Reach out and touch me 
And all I need is to feel you 
Reach out and touch me 

Like a prayer, your touch can take me there 
In my mind, you and me in a secret affair 
Oh boy youâre killing me and you donât even know it 
Try to hold back but I canât control it 

So, Iâm steppinâ to yaâ, skip the âHow ya doin'?â 
Grab your hand and pull you closer to me yeah 
Out the door we're slippinâ, then we start to kissing 
Boy youâre invited to my fan-ta-ta-sy 

And all I need is to feel you 
All I want is to feel you 

[CHORUS:]
Reach out and touch me 
Before I go insane 
Reach out and touch me 
Boy don't you make me wait 
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money 
Reach out and touch me 

All I want is to feel you 
Reach out and touch me 

Baby can't you see how you're affecting me 
Baby sensual, physical, fantasy 
Maybe, fate brought the two of closer now 
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna? 
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna? 
Reach out and touch me 

[CHORUS:]
Reach out and touch me 
Before I go insane 
Reach out and touch me 
Boy don't you make me wait 
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money 
Reach out and touch me 
Reach out and touch me 

Reach out and touch me 
Before I go insane 
Reach out and touch me 
Boy don't you make me wait 
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money 
Reach out and touch me 

And all I need is to feel you 
Reach out and touch me
