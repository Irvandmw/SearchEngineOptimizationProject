Lyrics:


My dad tried to tell me, like his dad tried to tell him
So I wouldn't make the same mistakes that they did
But young ears don't listen
It's the human condition
So the same lessons learned again and again
Seems no amount of preachin' can save us from stupid
Yeah the hard road to wisdom finds it's way through it...yeah
We're gonna hit some walls
We're gonna need some luck
Some doors will open, hearts will get broken
You can play it safe or you can risk it all
Sometimes we nail it, sometimes we blow it
It ain't always pretty, but its life as we know it
Some things we bring all on ourselves
No blame to pass onto anybody else
And lightning can strike with no cloud in the sky
And the innocent deal with the hand that their dealt
Life's not black and white not all right or wrong
It's beautiful and tragic
You blink and it's gone
We're gonna hit some walls
We're gonna need some luck
Some doors will open, hearts will get broken
You can play it safe or you can risk it all
Sometimes we nail it, sometimes we blow it
It ain't always pretty, but its life as we know it
Its life as we know it 
We're gonna hit some walls
We're gonna need some luck
Some doors will open, hearts will get broken
You can play it safe or you can risk it all
Sometimes we nail it, sometimes we blow it
It ain't always pretty, but its life as we know it
Ahhhhhh yeah...
Its life as we know it.
