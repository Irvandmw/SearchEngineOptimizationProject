[Jaden Smith:]
Why you drive so fast?
Why you drive so fast?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Girl, where you gotta go?

Baby you should try and drive slow
You should try and drive slow
Cause you're goin' 45 on a 15
I'm just tryna stay alive on the big screen
When you comin' up the drive all the kids scream
I don't know, baby girl you movin' onto better things
Why you drive so?

[Halsey:]
I don't have the time
I'm just tryna get mine
He's at it again, he's at it again, it happened, my friend
I had to pretend cause I'm only in this city for a minute
And I know you've been tryin' to get in it, and I'm with it but
You looking like you fell in love tonight
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
We hooked up one time it was kind of whatever... but...
Would you believe me if I said I was drunk?
Maybe I want you to want me but only tonight

[Jaden Smith:]
Why you drive so fast?
Why you drive so fast?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Girl, where you gotta go?

Baby you should try and drive slow
(Drive slow, homie)
Cause you're goin' 45 on a 15
I'm just tryna stay alive on the big screen
When you comin' up the drive all the kids scream
I don't know, baby girl you movin' onto better things
Why you drive so?

[Halsey:]
Usually you don't be used to me usin' you
You saw the truth in me, this is unnew to you, damn
Well this is love in the fast lane
New Benz, top down with the back stained
I was tryna give you Js and some fast brain
You were tryna give me Ks and your last name
Boy I think I should leave

Cause there's a flaw in the system
I don't really know why but I miss him
It was somethin' in his eyes when I kissed him
Listen, feeling like I can't dismiss him

For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Cause you've got a girl and she thinks it's forever
I know she'd love you if you'd only let her
Cause I'm a mistake and we both could do better

[Jaden Smith:]
Why you drive so fast?
Why you drive so fast?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Girl, where you gotta go?

Baby you should try and drive slow
(Drive slow)
You should try and drive slow
Cause you're goin' 45 on a 15
I'm just tryna stay alive on the big screen
When you comin' up the drive all the kids scream
I don't know, baby girl you movin' onto better things
Why you drive so fast?
Why you drive so fast?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Baby you should try and drive slow
