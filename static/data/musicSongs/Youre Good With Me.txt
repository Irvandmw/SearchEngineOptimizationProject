Lyrics:


I'm wondering what you'd do
If I needed you
And you're questioning
How I'd be if you needed me
Cause I can't go on without you here I need you
So please, don't go away, not today

If I were alone, would you come around?
Cause I'm awful on my own, I'm feeling too alone now
If I were alone, would you come to me?
Cause you can't see what I see, I need you here with me
And I know, I know, I know you're good with me

Ooh I, I am questioning all your love
Is it really enough
Ooh and I'm wondering where our love could go
Cause from here I don't know
And I can't go on without you here I need you
So please, don't go away, not today

If I were alone, would you come around?
Cause I'm awful on my own, I'm feeling too alone now
If I were alone, would you come to me?
Cause you can't see what I see, I need you here with me
And I know, I know, I know you're good with me

If I were alone, would you come around?
I'm not good alone and I need you now
Yes, I need you now, I need you now
If I were alone, would you come around?
I'm not good alone and I need you now
Yes, I need you now, I need you now

If I were alone, would you come around?
Cause I'm awful on my own, I'm feeling too alone now
If I were alone, would you come to me?
Cause you can't see what I see, I need you here with me
And I know, I know, I know you're good with me

If I were alone, would you come around?
I'm not good alone and I need you now
Yes, I need you now, I need you now
If I were alone, would you come around?
I'm not good alone and I need you now
Yes, I need you now, I need you now
