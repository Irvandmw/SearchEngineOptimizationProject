Lyrics:


Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow since she said she'd never forgive

The house that we've built was once filled with laughter
But I changed that laughter to tears
And now I live in a world without sunshine
Oh how I wish you were here

Shutters and boards cover the windows...

Last night I dreamed that you came to our house
To take an old book from the shelf
If you'll open the shutters I'll tear down the boards
Cause I drove every nail by myself

Shutters and boards cover the windows...
One more time
Shutters and boards cover the windows...
Shutters and boards
