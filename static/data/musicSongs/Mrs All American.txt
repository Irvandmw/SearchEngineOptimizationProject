Lyrics:


I love that accent you have when you say "Hello"
You relocated from New York a month ago
That minivan that you drive really gets me going
And if it feels like it's right then it can't be wrong

No one understands the chemistry we have
And it came out of nowhere

It's not like we planned this
It's getting out of hand
And now we're gonna go there

Walk my way
Mrs. All American
Say my name
No need to pretend
Don't be shy
Mrs. All American
I'll show you why
You're not gonna walk away

Not just a neighbour
Oh hey there I'll ring your bell
Open your door, pucker up
And I'll kiss you well

My lips are sealed
There's nobody that I would tell
Your secret's mine, close your eyes
And I'll make you melt

No one understands the chemistry we have
And it came out of nowhere

It's not like we planned this
It's getting out of hand
And now we're gonna go there

Walk my way
Mrs. All American
Say my name
No need to pretend
Don't be shy
Mrs. All American
I'll show you why
You're not gonna walk away

Na na na na na na na na
You know what she like
Na na na na na na na na
You know what she like
Na na na na na na na na
Ah you know what she like
Na na na na na na na

One, two, three, four

Walk my way
Mrs. All American
Say my name
No need to pretend
Don't be shy
Mrs. All American
I'll show you why
You're not gonna walk away

Walk my way
Say my name
You're not gonna walk away
Don't be shy
I'll show you why
You're not gonna walk away
