Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I always left some room to back away
Whenever love would get too close to me
I've always kept my feet on solid ground
And my head out of a cloud, no broken heart for me

But there you were, and there I was off-guard
Not able to protect me from your charm
And I felt myself falling further
Closer you got
And I fell in love up to my heart

I fell in love up to my heart
I couldn't stop myself, I went too far
I was standing on the edge and then
Next thing I knew I had
Fallen love up to my heart

I can feel myself fallin' more and more
And there's no use in fighting anymore
'Cause you went to my head and
All my defenses fell apart
And here I am, in love up to my heart

I fell in love up to my heart
I couldn't stop myself, I went too far
I was standing on the edge and then
Next thing I knew I had
Fallen love up to my heart

I was standing on the edge and then
Next thing I knew I had
Fallen love up to my heart
