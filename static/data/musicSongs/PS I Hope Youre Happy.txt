Lyrics:


Welcome home
How's your summer been?
I heard you moved in with your boyfriend
In New York

What's his name?
I heard he works downtown in finance
Is he just as good at romance
As we were?

Okay, enough
P.S. I hope you're happy
I started acting out when you moved on
I tried to call you
To eliminate the distance
I cared about you once
And always will

And I tried my best
Cross my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself
For when I was someone else
I might not get over this

But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it

But I won't be sad for the sake of it

What the hell?
I couldn't help but check your phone
Who the fuck is Drew from home, anyway?
This vacation
You said going home was boring
Left out that part of the story on your way

I might deserve it
But I can't take it
Maybe I should keep this to myself
'Cause if I'm honest
My record's less than flawless
You know that I get lonely when you're gone

And I tried my best
Cross my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself
For when I was someone else
I might not get over this

But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it

But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
