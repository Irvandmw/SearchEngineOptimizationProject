Lyrics:


I'm lying in the sun
longing for a place in the shadow
I'm lying in the snow
longing for a place by the fire 
?

[Chorus:]
I still carry on and
I still walk around and
I still feel the warming glow
shining somewhere in the future
shining not so far away 

I'm climbing up the mountain
mountain of society
But every time I reach the top
you just push me down again 

And when I look around me
I can see I'm not alone
There are a lot of people around
climbing mountains next to me 

But even though the cold from your still beating heart
already killed me twice
And even though the cold in your eyes
makes me freeze all the time 

[Chorus:]
I still carry on and
I still walk around and
I still feel the warming glow
shining somewhere in the future
shining not so far away
And when I beg you for water
you just drink the water yourself
And when I reach my hand to you
you just turn your face away
