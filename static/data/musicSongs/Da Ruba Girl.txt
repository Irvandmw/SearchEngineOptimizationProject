Lyrics:


You needed her, she needed you
To hold, to help fill a space
Last in line, last cage at the rescue
Was a love that no one could replace
Lying there like a lost string of pearls
Was Da Ruba Girl

Her best friend's name is Poncho
And she loves him, oh my gosh
Like Frosty Paws
She hates the mowers and the marrow
Like she hates to get a wash
Her hair doesn't grow and it doesn't curl
She's Da Ruba Girl

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

She protects this house and home
From the turkey and the deer
She won't ever let them roam
Anywhere round here
She'll even chase away the squirrels
That's Da Ruba Girl

She feels pretty with her painted toes
Ruby Red, 'cause that's what ladies do
She just appeared in her first video
And it's comin' out real soon
She'll be known all over the world
As Da Ruba Girl

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

Lying there like a lost string of pearls
Her hair doesn't grow and it doesn't curl
She'll even chase away the squirrels
She'll be known all over the world
As Da Ruba Girl

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
