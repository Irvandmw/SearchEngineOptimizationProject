Lyrics:


I'm feeling so alone now tonight even though you're here by my side
Is there something on your mind from the world you'd left behind

I feel as if the loved shared before doesn't wanna be here no more
And if there's something on your mind there's never been a better time 
To tell me
Do you love me,still wanting me like I need you, oh

There came a crossing on the road
If only there were signs to show me which direction I should go
I live my life with no regrets it hasn't caught up on me yet
But I never knew I was losing you

I wonder as you walk through the door are you gonna hurt me some more
Never took you for the kind who would play up on my mind

Tell me what are you looking for I can't play your games anymore
And when there's something on my mind I will always find the time 
To tell you
I still love you, still wanting you how I need you, oh

There came a crossing on the road
If only there were signs to show me which direction I should go
I live my life with no regrets it hasn't caught up on me yet
Well I never knew I was losing you; losing you

It's not for the first time
That someone else has hurt me by faking it too long
Where did we go wrong

There came a crossing on the road
If only there were signs to show me which direction I should go
I live my life with no regrets it hasn't caught up on me yet
Well I never knew I was losing you
Losing you
