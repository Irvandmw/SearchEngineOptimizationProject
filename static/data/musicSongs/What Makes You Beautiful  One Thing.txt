Lyrics:


You're insecure
Don't know what for 
You're turning heads when you walk through the door 
Don't need make up 
To cover up 
Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else on the world can see it 
Everyone else but you 

Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
They way you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know 
You don't know you're beautiful 
If only you saw what I could see 
you'd understand why I want you so desperately 
Right now I'm looking to you and I can't believe 
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful 

I tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you 
I can't ever be brave 
Cause you make my heart race

Shot me out of the sky 
You're my kryptonite 
You keep making me weak 
Yeah frozen and can't breath 

Something's got to give it now
Cause I'm dying to make you see 
That I need you here with me now 
Cause you've got that 
One thing 

So get out, 
Get out
Get out of my head 
And fall into my arms instead 
I don't 
I don't 
Don't know what it is 
I need that  
One thing  
And you've got that 
One thing 

Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair makes me overwhelmed 
When you smile at the ground 
It ain't hard to tell
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful 

So get out
Get out
Get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't 
I don't 
Don't know what it is 
I need that 
One thing
You've got that 
One thing
