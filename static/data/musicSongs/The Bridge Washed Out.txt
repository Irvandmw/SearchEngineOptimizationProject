Lyrics:


The bridge washed out
I can't swim
And my baby's on the other side

When I awoke this mornin'
The rain was pourin' down
I was gonna wed a little river girl
Just over the bridge across town
Now I'm runnin' up and down the river
And my nerves are drivin' me wild

Because the bridge washed out
I can't swim
And my baby's on the other side

Rain, oh rain stop a fallin'
Dark clouds hurry from the sky
The preacher warned my bride's a waitin'
And the weddin' bells are startin' to chime
I can't kiss and hold her
It's drivin' me outta my mind

Because the bridge washed out
I can't swim
And my baby's on the other side

And now I've got one foot in the water
But one foots solid on the ground
I'd try to swim that ragin' old river
But I know if I try I'll drown
There's not one boat around me
They've all gone out with the tide

Because the bridge washed out
I can't swim
And my baby's on the other side
'Cause the bridge washed out
I can't swim
And my baby's on the other side
