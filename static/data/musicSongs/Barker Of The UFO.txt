Lyrics:


Barker sing me a song
Instead of counting trees,
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr Barker
Clitheroe shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon,
Never before have I seen the like Mr Barker
Then the moment of depression fell around, Mr Barker
And the changes of expression to a frown, my friend Barker

There must be something there
Shadow of a light meaning men we are here, Mr Barker
Then the moment of depression fell around, Mr Barker
And the changes of expression to a frown, my friend Barker
There must be something there
Shadow of a light meaning men we are here, Mr Barker
Mr Barker sing me a song,
Instead of counting trees
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr Barker
Clitheroe shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon,
Never before have I seen the like, Mr Barker.
