Scum Gang
MJ
Feral

Slumped up, slumped up try not to get fucked up
Slumped up, slumped up try not to get fucked up
Slumped up, back up, 'fore you get your head bust
Slumped up, back up, 'fore you get your head bust

Got this FN on my body, if you feeling froggy
Got my gang right beside me, ready to catch a homi-
If you run up bitch I'm sorry, don't be moving wonky
Got this bitch all on my body, bitch get off my body
Get the fuck up out my whip
'less you tryna suck my dick
'less you tryna fuck my clique
'less you tryna stack this brick
'less you got shit I can sniff
'less you got shit I can taste
I might cut more off my waist
Get the fuck up out my face
When the k cock, it's a dirt nap
And if you catch me without that
Get hit in the cap
With a motherfuckin baseball bat
Dooby racks
4,5,6
That's a head cracked
That's a fact, that's a fact

Slumped up, slumped up try not to get fucked up
Slumped up, slumped up try not to get fucked up
Slumped up, back up, 'fore you get your head bust
Slumped up, back up, 'fore you get your head bust
