Lyrics:


We are the ones that walked to fire
And people said don't touch, yeah people say don't touch
We are the ones that never listen
We can't get burned enough, we can't get burned enough

And there's no boundaries
Can never hurt you, you can never hurt me
And we're so unique for falling in love and letting love be

You've gotta take me to that place
You let your guard down, yeah, you let your guard down, yeah
If you don't take me all the way
We'll let the world down now, can't let the world down, no

And there's no boundaries
Can never hurt you (now you've found me)
You can never hurt me (there's no boundaries)
And we're so unique for falling in love (now you've found me)
And letting love be (there's no boundaries)

If you don't take me all the way
We'll let the world down yeah
Can't let the world down, no
Can't let the world down, no
Can't let the world down, no

There's no boundaries
Can never hurt you (now you've found me)
You can never hurt me (there's no boundaries)
And we're so unique for falling in love (now you've found me)
And letting love be (there's no boundaries)
Letting love be, letting love be, letting love be, letting love be
Ooh yeah, just letting loveâ¦
