Lyrics:


Walking is an art, so is my body
Papi is a workaholic, I'm his little party
I'm Miss Parlor-Tricks, sips of the Bacardi
I can make you dope, sick from the naughtiness

He says, "Who the best?" You is!

I'm glamorous
Famous
Notorious
Dangerous, but you're crazy

I'm gonna leave you, he said, "You're not a real girl.
You're like a cartoon, all caught up in this fame game.
Yo, good luck, good luck, good luck.
May all the stars in the sky bow down to you.
We're through."

You gotta be smart, and I'm a little smarty
Papi is a gangster, I'm his little dolly
Party favour favourite of them all. He says,
"Baby doll is so sick, sick of your naughtiness."

Let's go to Vegas
They say, "Who the best?"
He said, "She is, she is but..."
Yo, she crazy, like in every single way
Like a hurricane, you gotta get out of the way

But she's hot and she's cold
And she's cool and she's bold
And she's full of rage like me
And I like the game yo

'Cause I'm glamorous
I'm famous
Notorious
Dangerous, but I'm crazy
Oh, glamorous
Dangerous
Notorious, famous but I'm crazy

He's gonna hate me, he wants a real girl!
I'm like a cartoon, all caught up in his fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck
He said, "We're through."
