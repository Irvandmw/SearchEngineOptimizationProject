Lyrics:


Here I go again
Standing in your arms crying
Here you go again
Make me forget everything
You keep me smiling

They say our love is just a phase
That it's just for some days
But I'm going so far
I wanna be where you are
He loves me
He loves me

Here I go again
Calling you every day
Here you go again
Make me forget the longing
I love everything that you say

They say our love is just a phase
Who believes that anyway?
But I'm going so far
I wanna be where you are
He loves me
He loves me

Here I go again
Standing in your arms crying
It starts all over again
Baby, I love you
I wanna be where you are
