Lyrics:


Turn to the six o'clock news, another soldier dies
Tried to hide it but I couldn't help it, I had to cry
When my little boy asked me daddy was he your friend
I said no, I didn't even know him

But he was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone

So I sat there in that chair and helped him understand
How this brave young man gave his life for our land
And although he's someone we'll never know
To you and me he is a hero

He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone

To the world he was a total stranger
Who kept us safe and out of danger
But now he's just a picture on TV
Somebody's memory

He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone
He was somebody's someone
