Lyrics:


I hate to say, I told you so
Though you deserve it, because you know
You left me crying for someone new
But all the heartache came back to you
Now youâre begging me to take you back
I told you so, I told you so

When you were king and ridding high
You thought your new love would never die
While you were laughing, I cried alone
You wouldnât hear from me a bomb
Now youâre begging me to take you back
I told you so, I told you so

I think youâre so, I know you shouldâve reap
I told you so, I told you so
You are alone and look before you leap
I told you so, I told you so
You canât win when youâre a jumpinâ jack
I told you so, I told you so

I hate to say, I told you so
We lived in closely and said it slow
When you were leaving I told you then
Youâre needing ever come back again
So let me tell you with a last goodbye
I told you so, I told you so
So let me, let me tell you with a last goodbye
I told you so, I told you so
