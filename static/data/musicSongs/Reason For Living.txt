Lyrics:


[Shane:]
I lie alone and thinking
How could this ever happen
Is it real, am I dreaming
And when your hearts been burned
How can someone learn
To get over their fears

[Nicky:]
You told me I should be strong
Oh I'm trying
I feel I can't go on
You left me here on my own

[Chorus:]
Without a reason for living
A chance for forgiving
A time to make it okay
And now I'm stuck with the vision
Of my indecision
Taking it all them away.. from me

[Bryan:]
With all the time you're taking
Slowly my hearts been breaking
You've been fine I've been bleeding
I'll have to wait my turn
Your respect I'll earn
No more joking or teasing

[Kian:]
You told me I should be strong
Oh I'm trying
I feel I can't go on
You left me here on my own

[Chorus:]
Without a reason for living
A chance for forgiving
A time to make it okay
(time to make it okay)
And now I'm stuck with the vision
Of my indecision
Taking it all away

[Mark:]
A thousand times before
I've been almost sure
This time I need to know
I've spent all my life
Chasing all my dreams
I'm not letting this
go ohhh.. yeah oohhhhh laeeee..
In my yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah ehh oooooohhhhh..

[Chorus:]
Without a reason for living
A chance for forgiving
A time to make it okay
And now I'm stuck with the vision
Of my indecision
Taking it all away
