Lyrics:


What you're doin'
Oh, baby, it's just not fair
The way you're lookin'
That little black dress you wear
Spinnin' around
Turnin' and, turnin' and, turnin'

Into motion, all the poetry in my mind
You've got me goin', a little closer every time
Don't slow down, never, no never, no never

Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you dancin' in the moonlight
You're so hot, tell you what, you're burnin' me up inside
So do whatever you want as much as you want, I'll be alright
Just don't hold back, don't play nice, baby, break my heart tonight

(Oh-whoa-whoa, yeah
Oh-whoa-whoa, yeah)

Shot me, shake me
Till I ain't got nothin' left
Just make me crazy
Till I'm callin' out for help

It's never too much, never, no never

And I just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you dancin' in the moonlight
You're so hot, tell you what, you're burnin' me up inside
So do whatever you want as much as you want, I'll be alright
Just don't hold back, don't play nice, baby, break my heart tonight

(Oh-whoa-whoa, yeah
Oh-whoa-whoa, yeah)

I know about me, I know about you
I know just what I'm gettin' into
Make it alright, make it all wrong
Just keep turnin' me on

Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you dancin' in the moonlight
You're so hot, tell you what, you're burnin' me up inside
So do whatever you want as much as you want, I'll be alright
Just don't hold back, don't play nice, baby, break my heart tonight

(Oh-whoa-whoa, yeah
Oh-whoa-whoa, yeah)
