[Romanized:]

Sou-sour candy
(Sou-sour candy)

I'm sour candy
So sweet, then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ask me to be nice, and then I'll do it extra mean
Tteutbakkui pyojeong hanae neon danghwanghagetji
Bissan cheogiran maldeullo nal pojanghan geon neoya, neoya
If you wanna fix me, then let's break up here and now
Georikkim eomneun nunbiche neon georil dunikka
Tuk kkabomyeon eogimeopsi sorijilleowa
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Oh)

I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside

I might be messed up
But I know what's love
You want a real taste
At least I'm not a fake
Come, come, unwrap me
Come, come, unwrap me
I'll show you what's me
Close your eyes, don't peek
Now I'm undressing
Unwrap sour candy
Come, come, unwrap me
Come, come, unwrap me
Come on, sour candy (Oh)

I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside

I'm sour candy
So sweet then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Take a bite, take a bite
S-sour candy (Sour candy)
Take a bite, take a bite (Uh)
S-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite
S-sour candy (Sour candy)
Take a bite, take a bite (Uh)
Sour candy
