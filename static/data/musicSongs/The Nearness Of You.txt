Song Name: The Nearness Of You
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this old sensation
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft light to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
The nearness of you
