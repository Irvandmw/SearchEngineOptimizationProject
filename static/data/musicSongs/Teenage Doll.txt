Lyrics:


Sweet as honey from a bee, all her lovin' is just for me
She's my girl, yes she's my teenage doll

My teenage doll, my teenage doll, oh how I love my teenage doll
My teenage doll, my teenage doll, oh how I love my teenage doll

With her hair curled on top and her dress in pink
She looks sad and mean with the cutest wink, I know she's the girl for me

My teenage doll, my teenage doll, oh how I love my teenage doll
My teenage doll, my teenage doll, oh how I love my teenage doll

We go ridin' in the pale moonlight, all the stars are shinin' bright
All alone in heavenly bliss, mmm that's when I get my kiss

My teenage doll, my teenage doll, oh how I love my teenage doll
My teenage doll, my teenage doll, oh how I love my teenage doll

Sometimes we have a little fight, then we make up following night
She and I make good company, later on she'll belong to me

My teenage doll, my teenage doll, oh how I love my teenage doll
My teenage doll, my teenage doll, oh how I love my teenage doll
