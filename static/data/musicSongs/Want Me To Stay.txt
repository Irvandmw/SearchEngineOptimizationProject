Lyrics:


I'm breaking down this wall
You can't see me at all
Just trying to reach out to you

I'll start this from the top
'Til the rain starts to drop
Out from the sky on to you

I won't pretend
Like the tension has all gone away
It's not that easy anyway
Please don't continue to see me and still walk away
Just want to hear you say

Why, can't I just go back in time
And erase it from my mind
'Cause I don't want to think of those nights
Why, can't it all just go away
I just want to give it up today
Please say you want me you want me to stay
You want me to stay

Yeah it's much harder
The what it really seemed
Can't tell the difference from real and make believe
But I'll make this story have the greatest ending
'Cause I still want your love, yeah there's no pretending

I won't pretend
Like the tension has all gone away
It's not that easy anyway
Please don't continue to see me and still walk away
Just want to hear you say

Why, can't I just go back in time
And erase it from my mind
'Cause I don't want to think of those nights
Why, can't it all just go away
I just want to give it up today
Please say you want me you want me to stay

And if you ask me to go
I won't say, no
But that is my last request
I hope you ask me to stay
Yeah, there ain't no other way
Please say you want me you want me to stay

Why, can't I just go back in time
And erase it from my mind
'Cause I don't want to think of those nights
Why, can't it all just go away
I just want to give it up today
Please say you want me you want me to stay

Why, can't I just go back in time
And erase it from my mind
'Cause I don't want to think of those nights
Why, can't it all just go away
I just want to give it up today
Please say you want me you want me to stay
