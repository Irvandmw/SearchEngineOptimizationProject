Lyrics:


Baby I'm a firefighter trapped in a burning house in a silent picture
& there is no way out except to watch the love between us die

That's called the Falling Angel
It's an amusement park ride
Some sort of rollercoaster
It takes you up & when it brings you down it gives you butterflies

& now I'm longing for your kiss
Bet you could read it on my lips

Waterfalls I'm jumping down

I know you're leaving baby
The birds are flying south
& there's nothing to say
I need you here 
I need your love inside of mine like I could die
