Lyrics:


It's the way you twist a curl into your hair
As you sit there unaware of how beautiful you are
It's the music that I always seem to hear
When you bring yourself to tears from laughing way too hard
And when we're slowly dancing and you slip off your shoes
Don't you know, baby, just like everything you do

That gets me, that just gets me every time
Right here inside this heart of mine
You open up your world and lay your love out on the line
That gets me, that just gets me every time

It's the way you say your prayers before you sleep
Then you curl up next to me and we hold each other close
And you tell me with your eyes that you'll never let me go
And that may be the moment that I love the most
When you make me feel like no other man exists
And when I taste the power and surrender of your kiss

That gets me, that just gets me every time
Right here inside this heart of mine
You open up your world and lay your love out on the line
That gets me, that just gets me every time

Right here inside this heart of mine
You open up your world and lay your love out on the line
That gets me, that just gets me every time
Oh that gets me, that just gets me every time

That gets me
It's the way you twist a curl into your hair
As you sit there unaware of how beautiful you are
It's the way you say your prayers before you sleep
Then you curl up next to me oh that gets me
That gets me
