Lyrics:


Well, it's been a while
Since I have smiled quite like this
And I think its all his fault
Cause he only tries to make me laugh

And my hearts all torn
Cause he's all that and more

But if only maybe he called me baby
Cause he only makes me feel alright
Through all the worries he kept me happy
I pray that he thinks of me tonight
Oh, if only maybe

I, I wish he could see
How much he really means to me
And I, I get all nervous
Not on purpose all the time

And my hearts all torn
Cause he's all that and more

But if only maybe he called me baby
Cause he only makes me feel alright
Through all the worries he kept me happy
I pray that he thinks of me tonight
Oh, if only maybe

(If only maybe, if only maybe)
If I was all alone, would you come on home
Would you be my baby
Well, what can I do, to make you see it too
I really need you

And if only maybe he called me baby
Cause he only makes me feel alright
Through all the worries he kept me happy
I pray that he thinks of me tonight

Cuz my hearts all torn
Cause he's all that and more

But if only maybe he called me baby
Cause he only makes me feel alright
Through all the worries he kept me happy
I pray that he thinks of me tonight
Oh, if only maybe
