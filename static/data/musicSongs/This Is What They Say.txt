Lyrics:


We're on the right track, I can feel it
I came alive first day that we met
I know what everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanna say it loud and proud
Got me feelin' confident
Yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)

You make my heartbeat work overtime (Work overtime)
I want your body right over mine (Right over mine)
So won't you cover me like full eclipse
Can't remember loneliness
Got me feelin' delicate
Yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)

This is what they say
Falling in love supposed to feel like
This is what they say
Falling in love supposed to feel like
Feels like
Never gonna be the same
Feels like
Never gonna be the same

This is what they say
Falling in love supposed to feel like

I like to give as good as I get (Good as I get)
Don't be surprised if this is the best (This is the best)
I'm always fallin' for your open mind
Love the way you open mine
Sweatin' like its summertime
Yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)

And when you hear me callin' your name (Callin' your name)
It's always different never the same (Never the same)
And every morning when I wake you up
Sugar you won't need a cup
You got me feelin' confident
Yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)

This is what they say
Falling in love supposed to feel like
This is what they say
Falling in love supposed to feel like
Feels like
Never gonna be the same
Feels like
Never gonna be the same
(Without cha now)

This is what they say
Falling in love supposed to feel like

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (This is what they say)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (This is what they say)

Can't look back the broken pieces
All the hearts we broke
We broke for reasons
No I can't look back at broken pieces
Of the hearts we broke
Broke for reasons

This is what they say (Can't look back the broken pieces)
Falling in love supposed to feel like (All the hearts we broke)
(We broke for reasons)
This is what they say (No I can't look back at broken pieces)
Falling in love supposed to feel like (Of the hearts we broke)
(Broke for reasons)

Feels like (Can't look back the broken pieces)
Never gonna be the same
Feels like (All the hearts we broke)
Never gonna be the same (We broke for reasons)
This is what they say (No I can't look back at broken pieces)
Falling in love supposed to feel like (Of the hearts we broke)
(Broke for reasons, no I)
