Lyrics:


Some people call me the space cowboy, yeah
Some call me the gangster of love
And some people call me Maurice
Cause I speak of the pompitous of love

People talking about me, baby
They say I'm doing you wrong, I'm doing you wrong
Don't you worry, don't you worry, don't you worry
Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home

I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover
And I'm a sinner
(Give up my life, my heart, my home)
I play my music in the sun

I'm a joker
I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
(Just to touch you once again)
I get my loving on the run

You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, Set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

People talking about me, baby
(Give up my life, my heart, my home)
They say I'm doing you wrong, I'm doing you all wrong
(I would give anything I own)
Don't you worry, don't you worry, don't you worry
(Just to touch you, just to touch you once again)
Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home

Is there someone you know
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I'm a picker
And I'm a grinner
And I'm a lover
And I'm a sinner
(Give up my life, my heart, my home)
I play my music in the sun, I play my music in the sun...

I'm a joker
A smoker
I'm a midnight toker
(Just to touch you once again)
I sure don't want to hurt no one

Some people call me the space cowboy, yeah
(Give up my life, my heart, my home)
Some call me the gangster of love
(I would give anything I own)
Some people call me Maurice
(Just to touch you once again)
Cause I speak of the pompitous of love
(Just to touch you once again)
Cause I speak once again
The pompitous of love
Just to hold you
Cause I speak once again
