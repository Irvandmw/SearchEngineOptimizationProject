Lyrics:


Home tonight
Rest my head
In my single childhood bed
Close my eyes
Count to three
Wish that you were here with me

Last year when my hands were cold,
You were always there to hold

So give me your warmest pair,
your strongest pair of mittens, please
Something to get me through, 
The loneliness of Christmas eve
I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair,
your strongest pair of mittens, please

By my table I survive,
Fix the makeup from my eyes,
Fake a smile so they will see
Wish that you were here with me

Last year when my hands were cold,
You were always there to hold

So give me your warmest pair,
your strongest pair of mittens, please
Something to get me through, 
The loneliness of winter
see, I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair,
your strongest pair of mittens, please

Shine your name,
Through the snow storm, baby,
You can break me, to the bone, oh
I was wrong, you were wrong to make me
feel like I was all alone,

Walking through my old home town,
No one else but me around,
Make an angel in the snow,
Pray that I can let you go

I fell for you, like crazy,
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair,
your strongest pair
your warmest pair
see, I fell for you, like crazy,
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair,
your strongest pair of mittens, please
