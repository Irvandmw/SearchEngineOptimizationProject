Lyrics:


I'm coming up slowly
I'm high on emotion
With waves of this feeling
As wide as the ocean
And then I see you
When I feel like I'm drowning
And then I see you
It's OK, it's OK, I'm OK, I'm alright again
It's OK, I'm OK, it's OK

Take me to that place where you always go
When you're sleeping or your day takes you low, so low
When I'm on and off again
On and off again
On and off again, oh

Take me to that place when I need someone
When I'm shaking or my mind starts coming undone
When I'm on and off again
On and off again
On and off again
You turn me on like

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

See me through this wild tide
Stay with me through all of time
If I'm drenched in madness, tangled blues
Won't you?
Oh, won't you?

Take me to that place where you always go
When you're sleeping or your day takes you low, so low
When I'm on and off again
On and off again
On and off again, oh

Take me to that space when I need someone
When I'm shaking or my mind starts coming undone
When I'm on and off again
On and off again
On and off again
You turn me on like

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You turn me on like
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You turn me on like
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You turn me on like
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You turn me on like
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You turn me on like
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Take me to that place where you always
Oh, won't you take me to that place
Take me to that place
Take me to that place
Take me to that place where you always go
Won't you take me to that place?
Won't you take me to that place?
Take me to that place
Take me to that place where you always go
Where you always go
Where you always go (Take me, take me)
Where you always (Take me)
Where you always (Take)
