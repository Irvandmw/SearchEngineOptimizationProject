Lyrics:


[ZillaKami:]
Drugs in my veins taking passage
Laid out trippin flipping addict with the habits
Paid a couple thousand for the casket
Niggas wanna sleep well after living savage
Vertical face split, skip the fuckin case shit
Bags in my eyes and my dreams in the hell pits
Burnin all my pictures from the scenes in the mansion
Using dirty dishes mentally I'm Charles Manson

[6ix9ine:]
Smooth nigga, false step you rise
Don't Move nigga, crosshairs in sight
The Zoo nigga, concrete both sides
Who you nigga, one step you die
Tekashi69 from that scum fuckin squad no doors break the walls scum gang till I fall

[ZillaKami:]
Zilla resurrect outta the crypts
The lochness off rip green yellow the piss
The Palm grip four fifth runnin round in the trench
Want shit talk shit might rip off ya lips
If you god I'm Kratos, the blackest of rose
The flower that bloomed at Selena it's thrown
The Yokai killer creepin in the grove
Y'all niggas pose I'm gone bake in the stove

[6ix9ine:]
Came to the god and ya jaw got bent
Big shit loud like the block got hit
Came outta jail still hitting them licks
Off on bail still flicking that wrist
Want Collabs ain't doin it for nuthin
Wanna meet up scum gang ain't trustin
Gettin beat up nah slick we bustin
Switchblade hip square up I'm cuttin

[ZillaKami:]
Acting like you scum but it ain't in ya veins
Acting like you scum but it ain't in ya brain
Lord of gauze and the God of the pain
Man I draw with force of the four horseman
Hundred to a thousand to the gold fuckin brick
You Fuckin with the rawest of the raw with the grip
With ya white tee cotton and the shit say rip
Ten toes never ever trip bitch
