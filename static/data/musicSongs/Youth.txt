Lyrics:


Growing older's like a sickness that you try but can't prevent
And I've been swallowing prescriptions like mental vitamins
And I've been travelling down the backroads on the corners of these streets
And everytime I saw those headlights I knew you were here for me

And hear me say "Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh"
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

If you need me you can find me on the roof
Where I pretend that all my problems are beneath me
And I'm worried that I'll jump but I never do
To be honest I just think I like the view
