Lyrics:


Hey, I got a secret
Sweetest daydream

You and me
I'm the land, you're the sea
Rushing me and tenderly kissing me
All along the shore
Love forever more

Just my daydream (daydream)
Though it may seem (may seem)
Vague and far away, I dream it every day
It's just my day dream (daydream)
Though it may seem (may seem)
Too good to be true, that's 'cause it's all about you

You're the night, and I'm on cloud number 9
A private place we can find in our mind, hey, I can share with you
I'm always there with you too
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Just my daydream, though it seem
Vague and far away, I dream it every day
Hee, just my daydream, though it may seem
Too good to be true, that's 'cause it's all about you

Crazy, crazy, crazy, that's what they call me
Lately I'm beginning to feel they may be right
'Cause anyone who's sane would have to be crazy to lie around
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night

You and me, I'm the land, you're the sea
Rushing in tenderly kissing me
All around the shore
Love forevermore

It's just my daydream (daydream)
Though it may seem (may seem)
Vague and far away, I dream it every day
Just my daydream (daydream)
Though it may seem (may seem)
Too good to be true, that's 'cause it's all about you

Ooh, crazy, crazy, crazy, that's what they call me
Lately I'm beginning to think they may be right
'Cause anyone who's sane would have to be crazy to lie around
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night

You and me, out of nowhere, suddenly
(In the nightfall, in the night)
And it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good
It's good to know you're there
Whatever's fair, sweet baby (in the nightfall, in the night)
(In the night) Thank you for the love
(Dream about you all the time) You set my way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(In the nightfall ... in the night ... in the night)
And I've got a secret (dream about you all the time)
Sweetest daydream (in the nightfall)
Said I've got a secret (in the night)
Sweetest daydream, oh, yeah
You and me, baby
Out of nowhere, suddenly, oh
Thank you for the love
Mmm, mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shabba-dabba-dwee-da-dwee...
