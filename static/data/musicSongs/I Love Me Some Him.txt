Lyrics:


I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do

I love me some him
Ooh, baby
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do

All those days and lonely nights have all gone away
I never thought the day would come that we'd be more than friends
You made me smile when I was down
You turned my world around
The way you give me love feels so right

You took the ease off my mind
And put it behind
You were there for all my needs
So baby please stay

I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do

I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do

Just like a dream come true
I wished for you
I have never been so happy 'bout love so new
You opened my heart
To a brand new start
My love's there wherever you are
I won't let no one take you away

You took the ease off my mind
And put it behind
You were thereâyes, indeedâ
For all my needs
Yes, you were baby

I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do

I love me some him
Ooh, baby
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do

'Cause you came along and changed my life
Told me things would be all right
And they were thanks to you baby baby
And now I have the strength to carry on
In my heart you have a home
And I never wanna be alone
'Cause I love me...
I love me some him

I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do

I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do
