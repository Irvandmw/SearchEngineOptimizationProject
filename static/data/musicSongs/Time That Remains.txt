Lyrics:


Donât do as I have done
Win where I have lost
Have where I have none
Donât let your demons drive
Theyâll just steer you wrong
You wonât get out alive

Because you canât unlive the pain
You canât rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place
In the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best is yet to come
In the time that remains for you

Donât get me wrong
The mistakes Iâve made along the way
Made me who I am today
The time is gonna come
You will wake up and realize
Just how fast your life goes by

Because you canât unlive the pain
You canât rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place
In the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best is yet to come
In the time that remains for you

Because you canât unlive the pain
You canât rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place
In the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best is yet to come
In the time that remains for you

The time that remains for you
For you
The time that remains
The time that remains
