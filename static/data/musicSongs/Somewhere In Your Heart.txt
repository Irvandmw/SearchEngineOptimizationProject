Song Name: Somewhere In Your Heart
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Somewhere in your heart, try to find a place for me
Somewhere in your heart, I won't care where it might be
One little corner may not mean so much to you
But one little corner would be enough to see me through

Somewhere in your dreams, let my lips come close to you
Though they're only dreams, someday they may all come true
Is it so much to ask for such a tiny part?
Won't you find a place for me, somewhere in your heart?

(Somewhere in your dreams), let my lips come close to you
(Though they're only dreams), someday they may all come true
Is it so much to ask for such a tiny part?
Won't you find a place for me, somewhere in your heart?
