Lyrics:


Thinking 'bout you, it ain't always about me
Don't make any sense in you being lonely
Hurry up and get here now but don't speed
I'll never get over you up under me

I'm available
Oh, yes I am
I'm available
Yeah, for you I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
I'm available
I'm available

Nothing like your hands on me
Regret the moments that they're off me and let it sink in
Hear me talking, don't ignore me
I was just about to call it what you thinking
Been thinking about you, can't get this vision out my head
Got a grip, I'm holding onto every thing you say
Ain't making this up just to get you in my bed
If you ain't left yet, you can go ahead

Thinkin' 'bout you, it ain't always about me
Don't make any sense in you being lonely
Hurry up and get here now but don't speed
I'll never get over you up under me

I'm available
Oh, yes I am
I'm available
Yeah, for you I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
I'm available
I'm available

Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)

I get frustrated when you're busy
Lately that's been more than often, baby, what is this?
It's like, do you even miss me?
Feeling less than priority, you got me convinced
Convinced I'm the only one, tripping in my head
Because in reality, you live in my bed
I'm supposed to hold on to every thing you said
Yes or no question, don't leave it unread

Are you available, now?
Oh here I am (Oh here I am)
Are you available? (Just tell me yeah)
Cause for you I am (You know I am)
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
Are you available?
Like I'm available

Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
