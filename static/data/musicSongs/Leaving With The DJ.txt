Lyrics:


(DJ Telemitry)

You drop that beat like fire, my new one and desire
You got me going higher, yeah, I'm getting higher
D-DJ, you are perfect, you show them why you worth it
You got them people raging, we're all just misbehaving

DJ, you're the one I'm thinking of
Because of you, I stopped to fall in love
No more bottles, so let's drink it up
I'm getting faded here with you

DJ, what you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
I've been waiting here for you every night and day
Won't make that mistake
Tell everyone I'm leaving with the DJ
What you gon' do?
Tell everyone I'm leaving with the DJ

We're about to turn the place out
Everybody in the crowd, there's no doubt
You can bring the beat back when the lights out
And that's when we begin to shout "Oh"
You're working it like a pro, I need it and you know
Baby, I can see us in love 'cause music makes me go

DJ, you're the one I'm thinking of
Because of you, I stopped to fall in love
No more bottles, so let's drink it up
I'm getting faded here with you

DJ, what you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
I've been waiting here for you every night and day
Won't make that mistake
Tell everyone I'm leaving with the DJ

Tonight, you're making me go insane
When the beat of the song pumps the blood through my veins
Like boom, boom boom, I feel that bass go boom, boom boom
You're like a drug I'm addicted to, got everything I'm attracted to
I think I'm going home with you
So I say, I think, I think I'm leaving with the DJ
Tell everyone I'm leaving with the DJ

You drop that beat like fire, my new one and desire
You got me going higher, yeah, I'm getting higher
(I'm leaving with the DJ, DJ)
D-DJ, you are perfect, you show them why you worth it
(I'm leaving with the DJ, DJ)
You got them people raging

DJ, you're the one I'm thinking of
Because of you, I stopped to fall in love
No more bottles, so let's drink it up
I'm getting faded here with you

DJ, what you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
I've been waiting here for you every night and day
Won't make that mistake
Tell everyone I'm leaving with the DJ
