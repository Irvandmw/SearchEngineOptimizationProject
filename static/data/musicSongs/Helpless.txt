Lyrics:


I wake up every morning and see your face 
lying right beside me it fills the space 
in my heart 
I can't live without you 
don't wanna figure right how to 
and every time I lay my head down to sleep 
the emptiness inside of me starts to beat 
so loud 
I can't hear the sound 
do you hear it? 
for you 

I fall in love all over again 
each time 
I lay my eyes on you 
I pretend 
I feel so helpless 
without you 
feel so helpless 
without you 
It takes a piece of me 
each time you leave 
I feel it in my chest 
so hard to breathe 
I feel so helpless 
without you 
I feel so helpless 
without you 

I witness every trick you got up your sleeve 
but still somehow you keep on surprising me 
I'm yours 
I can't live without you 
Don't wanna figure right how to 
Every time I see you I feel like I 
could be the luckiest man in the world 
Why try to fight it 
There's no need to hide it 
because 
you know 

I fall in love all over again 
each time 
I lay my eyes on you 
I pretend 
I feel so helpless 
without you 
feel so helpless 
without you 
Helpless 
It takes a piece of me
each time you leave 
I feel it in my chest 
so hard to breathe 
I feel so helpless 
without you 
I feel so helpless 
without you 

Feels like 
I fall apart 
every time 
Where do I start 
I'm so helpless 
without you 
without you 

Every time I close my eyes 
you're the first thing that runs to my mind 
Everywhere I go 
I see you 
hear you 
feel you 
I just wanna be near you 
and heal? you 
Last thing you said is how dare you 
First thing I said is I'm sorry 
Now I'm sitting here 
helpless 
man 
Same old story 

Now she's brokenhearted 
Time heals all the wounds 
She said 
Not this time 
It's true 
Everyone plays a fool 
And that fool is me 
Because I foolishly 
took advantage of a woman who loved me 

I fall in love all over again 
each time 
I lay my eyes on you 
I pretend 
I feel so helpless 
without you 
feel so helpless 
without you 
It takes a piece of me 
each time you leave 
I feel it in my chest 
so hard to breathe 
I feel so helpless 
without you 
I feel so helpless 
without you 

ohh yeah
