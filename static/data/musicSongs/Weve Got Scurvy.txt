Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Our gums are black
Our teeth are falling out
We've got spots on our backs
So give it up and shout

We've got scurvy
We need some vitamin C
We've got scurvy
We need a lemon tree
We've got scurvy
We just chillin' on the sea

Let's get this scurvy started!

A pirate ain't worthy
Till he got some scurvy
Since you got your scurvy on
You unnerve me when you sing that song

Scurvy! (Scurvy!)
We've got scurvy! (Scurvy!)
We've got scurvy! (Scurvy!)
We've got scurvy! (Scurvy!)
