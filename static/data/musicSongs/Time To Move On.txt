Lyrics:


Stripped off all these dirty sheets and burned 'em all
I think it's time to move on
Boxed up all your shit and donated it all
I think it's time to move on
Tough climb to come from rock bottom
But these high hopes are driving non-stop
Guess what? These chucks were made for walking baby
I think it's time to move on

Ooh oh, here I go
With the breeze at my back,
And a sail on my soul
Ooh oh, here I go,
And I'm going going going gone,
I think it's time to move on
I think it's time to move on

Erased all your numbers, and I'm changing mine
So I'm not tempted to call
Threw out every letter from you I could find
I think it's time to move on!

Break down, the tank is on empty
But these high hopes are driving non-stop
Guess what? These chucks were made for walking baby
I think it's time to move on

Ooh oh, here I go
With the breeze at my back,
And a sail on my soul
Ooh oh, here I go,
And I'm going going going gone,
I think it's time to move on
I think it's time to move on

Now every time I see you,
I still want you
I still need you
I know you need me, too
But we gotta stop,
We know we gotta stop!

I think it's time to move on, ooh oh ooh oh oh

Ooh oh, here I go
With the breeze at my back,
And a sail on my soul
Ooh oh, here I go,
And I'm going going going gone,
I think it's time to move on!
I think it's time to move on!
I think it's time to move on!
