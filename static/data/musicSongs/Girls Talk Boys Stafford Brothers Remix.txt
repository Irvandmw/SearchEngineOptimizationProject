Lyrics:


When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
Oh when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys

Hey!

Cause I've been talking to my friends
The way you take away my breath
It's something bigger than myself,
It's something I don't understand, no, no
I know we're young and people change,
And we may never feel the same,
So baby tell me what you say

Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell,
For you

When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
Oh when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys

Hey!

Cause I've been talking to my friends,
The way you take away my breath
It's something bigger than myself,
It's something I don't understand, no, no
I know we're young and people change,
And we may never feel the same,
So baby tell me what you say

Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell,
For you

Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell,
For you

(Hey!) (When the girls) [x6]
