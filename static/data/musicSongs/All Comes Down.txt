Lyrics:


I still hear the sound of that runaway train
Roll through my heart is lost lovers refrain
But I know in my heart I can never go back
To the way that we were on that runaway track

I see in my soul
That I know you were lying to me
I lose control
Oh I didnât know
Was I just too young?

Why do I feel so old?
âCause Iâm still so young

Yeah, but it all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you

If you see it
Why can you do it?
I am so alone tonight
And it's heartbreaking
Only choosing God would've saved you
Love is a battle oh oh oh
Everybody cries

It all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to you
(oh, oh, oh)

And if youâre wondering why
The vision in my soul
And I feel so alone
Like Iâm losing control, no
Am I just too young, oh, yeah

Why do I feel so old?
âCause Iâm still so young

It all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you
(all comes down to you)

When it all comes down to
When it all comes down to
(all comes down to you)
When it all comes down to
When it all comes down to
(all comes down to you)
All comes down to you
All comes down to you
All comes down to you
