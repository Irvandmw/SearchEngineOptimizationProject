Lyrics:


Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
You take my body
I give you heat
You say you're hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind

You blow my head
Make love (make love)
Inside your bed - everybody get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love

Every time I get hot
You wanna cool down
Every time I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Every time I get a - Get down, get down, get down
Make love

(Get down) I can squeeze - (make love) you can shake me
(Get down) I can feel (make love) when you break me
(Get down) Come on so heavy (make love)
(Get down) When you take me (make love)
You make love, you make love, you make love (get down), you make love (make love)

You can make everybody get down make love
Get down make love

Every time I get high
You wanna come down
Every time I get hot
You say you wanna cool down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Every time I wanna, get down, get down get down

Make love make love make love make love

Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love

Every time I get high
You wanna come down
Every time I get hot
You say you wanna cool down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Every time I wanna, get down, get down get down make love
