Lyrics:


I don't wanna dream about you
Every single night
And I don't wanna get all shook up
When I hold you tight
I don't wanna settle down
I'm just not ready to
I don't wanna love you, but I do
Yes I do

I don't wanna count the hours
'Til you're by my side
And I don't wanna get so jealous
I forget my pride
I don't want this heart of mine
To be so doggone true
I don't wanna love you, but I do

I made up my mind to stay as free as can be
But no matter how I fight it
You've got something that gets me, yeah

I don't want my world to crumble
When I make you mad
And I don't wanna feel like cryin'
Everytime you're sad
But no matter what I want
I can't stop wanting you
I don't wanna love you, but I do
No I don't wanna love you
Aw but I do
No I don't wanna love you
Aw but I do
