Lyrics:


Pop open this, this magic pink capsule
I'm in heaven, just throw me one, I'm full
I haven't slept, I never eat, I'm full
Eyes wide open, I cannot sleep, I'm dull
Pop open this, this magic pink capsule
I'm in heaven, just throw me one, I'm full
I haven't slept, I never eat, I'm full
Eyes wide open, I cannot sleep, I'm dull

Pop open this, this magic pink capsule
I'm in heaven, just throw me one, I'm full
I haven't slept, I never eat, I'm full
Eyes wide open, I cannot sleep, I'm dull
Pop open this, this magic pink capsule
I'm in heaven, just throw me one, I'm full
I haven't slept, I never eat, I'm full
Eyes wide open, I cannot sleep, I'm dull

This will make you feel better
This will make you feel better
This could be the antidote or gateway drug
Either way baby you know it's temporary fun
And you don't have to sip none from the cup
Lick it up (tender, tender)
Tender to the touch
She still frequent fender benders
Now she slender in the butt
Chop it up more, baby
Chop it up

Pop open this, this magic pink capsule
I'm in heaven, just throw me one, I'm full
I haven't slept, I never eat, I'm full
Eyes wide open, I cannot sleep, I'm dull
Pop open this, this magic pink capsule
I'm in heaven, just throw me one, I'm full
I haven't slept, I never eat, I'm full
Eyes wide open, I cannot sleep, I'm dull

Pop open this, this magic pink capsule
I'm in heaven, just throw me one, I'm full
I haven't slept, I never eat, I'm full
Eyes wide open, I cannot sleep, I'm dull
Pop open this, this magic pink capsule
I'm in heaven, just throw me one, I'm full
I haven't slept, I never eat, I'm full
Eyes wide open, I cannot sleep, I'm dull
