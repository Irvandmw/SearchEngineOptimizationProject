Lyrics:


Tail lights and runways
We put on a brave face
We write down the details to make us feel safe
Cold on the mattress
Sad and alone
I think it's ten thousand minutes 'til I get home
Someday we're gonna get to do all the things that we wanted to

Never wanna say goodbye
You always see through my disguise
You're the one who breaks my heart right
You tear me up and wreck my dreams
I hold your hand when I'm asleep
I don't mind falling for a lifetime
'Cause you break my heart right

Be tender and honest
And sometimes say words that hurt
I hold all your troubles
Even if you won't
And someday we're gonna get to do all the things that we wanted to, yeah

Never gonna say goodbye
You always see through my disguise
You're the one who makes my heart right
You tear me up and wreck my dreams
I hold your hand when I'm asleep
I don't mind falling for a lifetime
'Cause you break my heart right

Don't say you're sorry
Stay in my head
Don't protect me, show me real love, not pretend

Never wanna say goodbye
You always see through my disguise
You're the one who breaks my heart right
You tear me up and wreck my dreams
I hold your hand when I'm asleep
I don't mind falling for a lifetime
'Cause you break my heart right

I don't mind falling for a lifetime
'Cause you break my heart right
