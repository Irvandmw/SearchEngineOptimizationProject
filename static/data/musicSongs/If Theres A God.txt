Lyrics:


If there's a God
Where does He go to
When disease and hunger
Knock on the door?

And if there's a God
How does He decide
That she'll be born rich
But he'll be born poor?

I don't know
Can you tell me? Oh
Can you tell me? Oh

If there's a God
Why does He let
People die slowly
Racked by pain?

And if there's a God
Who blesses with children
Why does He steal
Some back again?

I don't know
Can you tell me? Oh
Can you tell me? Oh

If there's a God
Why is He letting
Violence and murder
Be done in His name?

But if there's no God
Why am I lying
Here in the dark
Saying his name?

I don't know
Can you tell me? Oh
Can you tell me? Oh

I don't know
Can you tell me? Oh
Can you tell me? Oh
