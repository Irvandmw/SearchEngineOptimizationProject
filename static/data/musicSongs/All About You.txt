Lyrics:


Friday night, gonna pick you up
Where it goes from there, it doesn't matter much
'Cause it's all about you
Yeah, it's all about you

Heading out or hanging in
Movie on the couch or a hillbilly band
Girl, it's all about you
Yeah it's all about you

I don't care what we do, what we don't girl
I'm just freaking digging living in your world
You got the hot, I gotta get next to
Where we go, where we get, how we get down
Don't matter girl, as long as we're getting around
Just messing around, baby ooh, baby ooh
Yeah, it's all about you

Bust my butt for every cent
Just to spend all them dead presidents
Yeah, it's all about you
Girl it's all about you

All my buddies giving me lip
Saying that there boy's just a little bit whipped
Well, maybe that's true
'Cause it's all about you

I don't care what we do, what we don't girl
I'm just freaking digging living in your world
You got the hot, I gotta get next to
Where we go, where we get, how we get down
Don't matter girl, as long as we're getting around
Just messing around, baby ooh, baby ooh
Yeah, it's all about you

Find me a banjo I can bang on
Just might write me a little love song
Going ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, yeah, it's all about you

I don't care what we do, what we don't girl
I'm just freaking digging living in your world
You got the hot, I gotta get next to
Where we go, where we get, how we get down
Don't matter girl, as long as we're getting around
Just messing around, baby ooh, baby ooh
Yeah, it's all about you
Yeah, it's all about you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, yeah, it's all about you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's all about you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, yeah, it's all about you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's all about you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
