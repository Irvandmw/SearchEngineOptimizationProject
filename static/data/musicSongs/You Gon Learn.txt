Lyrics:


'Cause each and every day that you stay away
Breaks my achin heart in two
And it's causing to pray oh baby, baby

Let me talk to my congregation
They tell me the money talk so let's get some communication
It took forever but you've been patient
The negative liars tryin to hint at the reputation
Just know your troubles won't be forsaken
They tell me the money talks so just pay me with conversation
Everything has a price if you don't know what you pay for your life
You don't know what you pay for your life
You gon learn tonight

[Hook:]
This is where you learn how to win
The congregation is here, let the conversation begin 
(Amen)
Turn your scriptures to page ten
'Cause loyalty is everything and flip floppin should be a sin 
(Amen)
Pass the offer and play the game
If you supportin the movement then prove it by what you spend
Everything has a price if you ain't learn anything in your life
Just do whatever you like, you gon learn tonight

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Tell em you sippin purple
While smoking and getting faded
Lying ainât really lying, the rappers is entertainment
When you get imitated that's when you know that you made it
Rappers go after women that every rapper done dated
Open the candy gates so she told me she Athiest
This vehicle heavenly I just hope that you make the list
There isn't a man alive that can say he created this
Keep going until your pockets and dropping cremated chips
Give me your dead prezzies I'mma roll with the dezzie
Eagle that's just so people who evil will know Iâm ready
Pretty women who skeamin and cobin me at the telly
That's easy as tryna take off a condom with a machete
My congregation is heavy conversation is skill
Put money inside the plate that I'm offering until is pill
Blasphemy if you actually got gangsta after a deal
The book of Bernard Friedman say thou is not trill

[Hook]
This is where you learn how to win
The congregation is here, let the conversation begin 
(Amen)
Turn your scriptures to page ten
'Cause loyalty is everything and flip floppin should be a sin 
(Amen)
Pass the offer and play the game
If you supportin the movement then prove it by what you spend
Everything has a price if you ain't learn anything in your life
You gon learn tonight

[Verse 2: Saigon]
I've been knowing for attacking the preacher
Who doesnât practice what he preach
Slapping the rapper to keep inaccuracies in his speech
Say pack it when he reach 
It ain't for nothing but for the jack 
That only back him cause heâs sweet
Yappin about a rap sheet,
When he ain't' even got one
Nigga was an athlete
Never touch the shot gun
Hurt cause heâs too fake
Worst than the two fate
Tough when he be on TV 
But in personâs a fruitcake
Our Father who art in heaven
Hollow be Thy name
Thatâs what he gon scream
If some hollows in his frame
But he ainât to blame
He gon be in a lot of pain
Different between rappers and gangtsaâs, 
Itâs not the same
Yet I bow my style is holier than thou
We good God gangbangers 
We hold each other down
You, you a bitch, 
You can probably do a full split
So come off of the pulpit with that bullshit

[Hook]
This is where you learn how to win
The congregation is here, let the conversation begin 
(Amen)
Turn your scriptures to page ten
'Cause loyalty is everything and flip floppin should be a sin 
(Amen)
Pass the offer and play the game
If you supportin the movement then prove it by what you spend
Everything has a price if you ain't learn anything in your life
You gon learn tonight

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Where do you go when you see the road in the forks split
Hope its some soldiers you're walking into that door with
Lucky to beat but I always though I would forfeit 
Have me as twisted as dispruted I open corpse with
Off course itâs the switching 
Off course itâs in my vision
Thought I would shooting blanks
But I pop a clip and I listen
Devas just keep on coming and master their repetition
Try to kill off my spirit no time for a exorcism
All of this âAmmunitionâ 
Time for a revelation 
Always was trigger-happy 
I never had hesitation
They ainât upon my level 
Me and them ainât adjacent
I'm the original and they just some interpolations
Livin inside a world that we know is unfair
Rewind to the times when a mother told me that notice was there
Then she told me donât just be ready 
Be overprepared
And always keep God first 
Well you bout to owe him a prayer 
You almost there

[Hook]
This is where you learn how to win
The congregation is here, let the conversation begin 
(Amen)
Turn your scriptures to page ten
'Cause loyalty is everything and flip floppin should be a sin 
(Amen)
Pass the offer and play the game
If you supportin the movement then prove it by what you spend
Everything has a price if you ain't learn anything in your life
You gon learn tonight
