Lyrics:


Give you all the lovin' that your heart...
Give you all the lovin' that your heart desires

One day you say you love me
The next you tell me you don't
One day you say you will
But the next you tell me you won't
Hey little baby
There ain't much point me hanging around (yeah)

(Give you all the lovin' now)

One day you make me feel that your love is in my hands
One day you say you'll stay
But the next you're changing your plans
Hey little baby
Ain't much point in hanging around (yeah)
There ain't much point in hanging around (yeah)
Cause' if you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy

It's kind of funny that you think
That I'm the boy to make you cry
I can make you happy
If only for a while
Little baby, ooh little baby
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy

I said, it could be the price of love
Could be the price of hate
What am I guilty of?
Why do you make me wait so long?
I don't know your intentions
Look to the skies above
I'm in the hands of fate
Push 'til it gets to shove
I've got to know for heavens sake
Is this love, is this love
Is this love or invention
Baby can't you see I'll find another fantasy

Give you all the lovin' that your heart... oh yeah
Give you all the lovin' that your heart...
(Baby, I'll make you feel)
Give you all the lovin' that your heart (so sexy) ...desires
Baby can't you see I'll find another fantasy

You hang around the people who are sure to make you cry
I can make you happy if only for a while
Little baby, ooh little baby
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart...
You take, you take someone's heart
And you kick it around
Keep on picking it up
So you can watch it come down
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
While I wait for you to make up your mind
Could you please be so kind
When you know what to do
I'll be in the next room
But if you leave it too late
I may be in the next state

If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy
