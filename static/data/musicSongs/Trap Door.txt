Lyrics:


You say youâre a minute from the deep end 
They cut cold the courtesy, its sink or swim now 
And your bodyâs aching for a breath, Iâll give it to ya 
With a trapt door to take care of all of them 

Come away, come away now 
You wonât stand from afar 
When you hear me sayin 
Come away, come away now 
Cause youâre too close for me to call 

Iâve seen the foolish shame the wise 
You just kept quiet with his own surprises 
And your Trojan horse is big enough to save them all 
And youâre not a foolish one at all 

Come away, come away now 
You wonât stand from afar 
When you hear me sayin 
Come away, come away now 
Cause youâre too close for me to call 

Lost to found, do you know 
Youâre the victim ofâ¦ 

Kick-slide your pose, let it go 
You donât need them 
Only flesh, blood, and bones 

Weâre the same, you and I 
Far too young to die 

Come away, come away now 
You wonât stand from afar 
When you hear me sayin 
Come away, come away now 
Cause youâre too close for me to call
