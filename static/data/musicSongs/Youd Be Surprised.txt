Lyrics:


She's not so good in a crowd but when you get her alone
You'd be surprised
She isn't much at a dance but then when I take her home
You'd be surprised
She doesn't look like much of a lover but don't you judge a book by its cover
She's got the peace of an angel but there's a devil in her eyes
She's such a delicate thing but when we start-a to squeeze
You'd be surprised
She doesn't look very strong and though she's weak in the knees
Surprise surprise surprise
At a party or at a ball I got to admit she's nothing at all
But in a Morris chair you'd be surprised

You'd be surprised

You'd be surprised

She doesn't look like much of a lover but don't-a judge a book by its cover
She's got the peace of an angel but there's a devil right in her eyes
She's such a delicate thing but when we start-a to squeeze
Oh oh surprise
She doesn't look very strong and though she's weak in the knees
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball I got to admit she's nothing at all
But in a Morris chair you'd be surprised
