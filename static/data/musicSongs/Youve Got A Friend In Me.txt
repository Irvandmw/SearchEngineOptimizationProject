Lyrics:


You've got a friend in me
You got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
You've got a friend in me

You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got troubles, I got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and see it through
'Cause you've got a friend in me
Yeah you've got a friend in me

Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
But none of them will ever love you
The way I do
It's me and you

And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
Yeah you've got a friend in me
