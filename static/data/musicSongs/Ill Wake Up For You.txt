Lyrics:


I'll wake for you
In an hour or two
Just promise me you won't do what you used to
I'm following you to the dangerous nights
Hoping that I'll wake up tonight
And I won't be long, just wait for me
Don't go nowhere, just wait as I dream

I'll wake for you, if you want me to
Don't pull away too soon
I'm listening to what you say
I'll wake up real soon, I'll wake up for you

Yeah, I'll wake up for you,
If you really want me too
Cause you that I, I'd do anything for you
I would give it all just to see you smile
Cause to know you're OK
Makes things worth while
And I won't be long, just wait for me
Don't go nowhere, just wait as I dream

I'll wake for you, if you want me to
Don't pull away too soon
I'm listening to what you say
I'll wake up real soon, I'll wake up for you

Yeah I've been sleeping for a long long time
So now I don't dare to even look behind
And if you want me to awake
A simple kiss is all that it takes
You want me to wake, wake, you want me to wake up

I'll wake for you, if you want me to
Don't pull away too soon
I'm listening to what you say
I'll wake up real soon, I'll wake up for you

I'll wake up for you
I'll wake up oo, yeah
