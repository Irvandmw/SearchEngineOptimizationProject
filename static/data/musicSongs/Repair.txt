Lyrics:


You learn to walk, you learn to run
And they said, "Not enough"
They said, "Bring me the sun"
You gave your best, you gave them all
But they paid no attention
And they showed you the door

Heart on your sleeve is bleeding, don't stop now
Perfectly incomplete, just don't stop now
Go with this energy, just don't stop now
Don't stop now

When your head is broken
Take my shoulder
Hide your worries there
Yeah, my arms are open
Dreams get stolen
Know that someone cares
I'll stay up with you
By your side 'til you repair

You'll never rest, no second-best
No escaping the pressure
Of the weight on your chest
I never felt a love like yours
So let me give what you give me
When you're down on the floor

Heart on your sleeve is bleeding, don't stop now
Perfectly incomplete, just don't stop now
Go with this energy, just don't stop now
Don't stop now

When your head is broken
Take my shoulder
Hide your worries there
Yeah, my arms are open
Dreams get stolen
Know that someone cares
When you're thunder, lightning
Screaming, fighting
Drowning in despair
When you're howling, hurting
Lightning surging
Know that I'll be there
I'll stay up with you
By your side 'til you repair

When you're thunder, lightning
Screaming, fighting
Drowning in despair
When you're howling, hurting
Lightning surging
Know that I'll be there
I'll stay up with you
By your side 'til you repair
