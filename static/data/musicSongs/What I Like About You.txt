Lyrics:


[Luke:]
That's what I like about you
You hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
Wanna come over tonight?

[Michael:]
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true
That's what I like about you

[Calum:]
What I like about you
You really know how to dance
When you go up, down, jump around
Think about true romance

[Michael:]
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true
That's what I like about you

[Luke:]
That's what I like about you
What I like about you
That's what I like about you
What I like about you
That's what I like about you
What I like about you
That's what I like about you
What I like about you

[Ashton:]
What I like about you
You keep me warm at night
["You hold me real tight" at live version]

[Ashton & Calum:]
Never wanna let you go
Know you make me feel alright
... three, four

[Michael:]
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true
That's what I like about you

[Luke:]
That's what I like about you
What I like about you
That's what I like about you
What I like about you
That's what I like about you
What I like about you
That's what I like about you, you
That's what I like about you
