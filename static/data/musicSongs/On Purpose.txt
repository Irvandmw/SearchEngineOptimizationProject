[Chris Brown:]
She said can I vibe with you baby
For a night
I cannot say no to you baby
You know I can't do that
You have my eyes, they glued to you, ooh yeah
Baby, you're so damn fine, I'll prove it to you
Yes, I'll prove it to you

Ooh, I'll show you
It isn't more (I'll be there more)
I see what you be going through
You ain't gotta hurt anymore
'Cause I love you baby

I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose
Stop, I know that you nervous
But you the only one that's worth it
I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose
I promise, I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose

[Agnez Mo (Chris Brown):]
If I get a mirror, would it clear up your view (a little better)
And when I smoke clear up, I'm still stuck on you (it's on purpose)
I haven't felt like this in a while
Don't feel like I'm in down
You're love's around
Boy, I feel you

[Agnez Mo:]
You know that is more
You see what I've been going through
I ain't gotta hurt anymore
'Cause you love me baby

[Chris Brown:]
I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose
Stop, I know that you nervous
But you the only one that's worth it
[Chris Brown & Agnez Mo:]
You said I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose
I promise, I got this, don't worry
And I know God put you here on purpose

I got this, don't worry
Don't worry
Ooh

[Chris Brown:]
Ooh, I'll show you
It isn't more (I'll be there more)
I see what you be going through
You ain't gotta hurt anymore
'Cause I love you baby

[Chris Brown & Angez Mo:]
'Cause I love you baby
You're my baby, yeah
Oh baby
You got this, don't worry
You got this, don't worry
