Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I put my name on a Christmas card
with love from me to you
âCause I believe if weâre strong enough
our wishes will come true

[Chorus:]
Theyâre dreaming of a white Christmas
Iâm dreaming of you
I just need you by my side
upon a Christmas night

I put a coat on I go for a walk
and let the others talk
Flashing starlight when I look up
they know that Iâm in love

[Chorus:]
Theyâre dreaming of a white Christmas
Iâm dreaming of you
I just need you by my side
upon a Christmas night
