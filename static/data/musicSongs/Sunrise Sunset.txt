Lyrics:


Sunrise, Sunset
Never needed anyone now I need a rest
The illusion of you training my soul
At the same time filling me up
Making me whole

I wish there was a word to express the way I feel about you
But the way I hope you feel about me
You've got me where you want me
Can't you see?

Listen
I love you
I really do
There's no one else for me but you
I love you
I really do
There's no one else for me but you

Sunrise, sunset
Light enters darkness with no regrets
You give yourself into the unknown
