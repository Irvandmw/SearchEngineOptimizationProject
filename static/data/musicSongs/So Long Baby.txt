Lyrics:


(So long baby so long)
So long baby you better go now
So long baby I guess I know now
Well you didn't care for me the way I cared for you
Yeah you took my loving heart and broke it in two
So long baby let's say goodbye now
So long baby I better cry now
All I can tell you even though I might be wrong now
So long baby so long
Well you didn't care for me the way I care for you
Yeah you took my loving heart and broke it in two
So long baby let's say goodbye now...
Cause so long baby so long
Cause so long baby goodbye
