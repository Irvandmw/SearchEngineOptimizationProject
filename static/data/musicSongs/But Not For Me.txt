Song Name: But Not For Me
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


They're writing songs of love - but not for me, a lucky star's above - but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play  - can guarantee
I was a fool to fall - and get this way;
Hi ho alas and also lackaday
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not - she's not for me
Old man sunshine - listen you never tell me dreams come true
Just try it - and all start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare ever tell me she will care
I'm certain - it's the final curtain
I never want to here from any cheerful Polly-Anna's
Who tell you fate supplies a mate - it's all bananas
It all began so well - but what an end, this is the time - a fellow needs a friend
When every happy plot, ends with a marriage knot
And there's no knot, no (k)not for me
