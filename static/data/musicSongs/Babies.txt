Lyrics:


Pour the lean feel lazy (mmm)
Drop the coupe, hit a race, I'm crazy
Bad lil bitch wanna have my baby
But I never let a bitch come and date me

Sauve said he goin' and I know that nigga blown away
In another planet, you ain't never been to my place
I be, ridin' foreign, slidin' out the freeway
Midget hold the choppa and JD spray the paint away
I stopped taking shit, but that bitch, she wasted
And I got a lot of bands that's why they hatin'
When I went to Miami all my fans was waitin'
Stupid dumb bitch can't fuck 'cause she basic
[?] that's for my nigga Kari (Kari)
Put that nigga six feet, but, no, not sorry
Spend it for my nigga, put a Glock in my Rarri
Lookin like a [?], let her [?] out my closet (gang)

Pour the lean feel lazy (mmm)
Drop the coupe, hit a race, I'm crazy
Bad lil bitch wanna have my baby
But I never let a bitch come and date me

Nigga back then, when they used to try to play me
Now these niggas mad, 'cause these pussies gotta pay me
Walk up in the club, showin' love, it get rainy
She give me top, yeah, she swallow my babies
She vegan, she on a dick diet
I wear a jacket no matter the climate
No TSA 'cause we only fly private
Roll up a backwood, we smoke with the pilot
Bitch this standout, we lookin' for some handouts
Smokin' 'till it's ran out, so how y'all cannot limo
Boof, that's comin' down, choppa lay him mass out
Used to be a class clown, shooters [?]

Pour the lean feel lazy (mmm)
Drop the coupe, hit a race, I'm crazy
Bad lil bitch wanna have my baby
But I never let a bitch come and date me
