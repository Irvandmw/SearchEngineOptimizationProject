Lyrics:


Nights are long since you went away.
I think about you all through the day.
My buddy, my buddy.
Nobody quite so true.

I miss your voice, the touch of your hand.
I long to know that you understand.
My buddy, my buddy.
Your buddy misses you.

I miss your voice, the touch of your hand.
I long to know that you understand.
My buddy, my buddy.
Your buddy misses you.
