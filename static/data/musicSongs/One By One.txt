Lyrics:


Have you ever been so down
Everytime you looked around
Despair is like a silent clown beside you
Well centuries fly and decades pass
Buildings fall and mountains last
Today is not to give you but to guide you

But you can't look back
What is done is done
And the time that you spent on yesterday
Today is halfway gone
And we learn to live our days one by one

Have you ever loved so hard
You opened up and dropped your guard
And fell to earth, your feelings burned and branded
Well love is like a ladies song
It takes you in and leads you on
And in the morning leaves you high and stranded

But you can't look back
What is done is done
And the time that you spent on yesterday
Today is halfway gone
And we learn to live our days one by one

But you can't look back
What is done is done
And the time that you spent on yesterday
Today is halfway gone
And we learn to live our days one by one
And we learn to live our days one by one
