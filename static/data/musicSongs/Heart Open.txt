Lyrics:


This is not a sad song, it's about the ones you love
One in every small crowd, too afraid to open up and talk
Feeling like a lost child crying for mother's love
No one really knows what happens to the best of us

Tell me it's a long way down
Tell me 'cause I'm with you now
Man, you're not broken
So keep your heart open now
Tell me that you lost yourself
Wishing you were someone else
Man, you're not broken
So keep your heart open now

People on the outside, they don't understand what's up
How can they understand when you don't even know enough, enough
Feeling like a lost child crying for mother's love
Always on the outside, too afraid to open up and talk

Tell me it's a long way down
Tell me 'cause I'm with you now
Man, you're not broken
So keep your heart open now
Tell me that you lost yourself
Wishing you were someone else
Man, you're not broken
So keep your heart open now

Keep your heart open now
Keep your heart open now

Tell me it's a long way down
Tell me 'cause I'm with you now
Man, you're not broken
So keep your heart open
Tell me that you lost yourself
Wishing you were someone else
Man, you're not broken
So keep your heart open
