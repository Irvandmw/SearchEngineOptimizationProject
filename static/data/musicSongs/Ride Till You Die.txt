Lyrics:


[Bebe Rexha:]
Take me to some city, where the lights are bright
When I with you sugar it's like paradise
Take me thousand miles, a thousand miles away
We'll be so far gone just like a runaway

Baby hold me tight
No more lonely nights
Where we'll end up, no one really knows
As long as I'm in your arms

We'll be all right
Rebels of the night
Like Bonnie do with Clyde
Will you ride until you die?
Will you ride until you die?
Rebels of the night
Like Bonnie do with Clyde
Will you ride until you die?
Will you ride until you die?

[Voli:]
Cadillac convertible pushing on the gas
Wind blowing through your hair, your foot up on the dash
My heavenly angel with a devilish laugh
We lit the world on fire that's a hell of a match
Lets let the sunset swallow us, we against the world
I hold your body close to me, that's me against my girl
No religion, I'll believe in you
If they don't give you no credit, baby, I'll pre-approve
Hey doll, you dim the stars, I'll give you my eyes so you see who you are
Just tell me when
Let's drive forever
Two loners in the night but we shine together
Hey doll, let's break the law, 'cause I'm your rebel and your my cause till the end
Ride together, die together
Even if we broke, we spend out lives together

[Bebe Rexha:]
We'll be all right
Rebels of the night
Like Bonnie do with Clyde
Will you ride until you die?
Will you ride until you die?
Rebels of the night
Like Bonnie do with Clyde
Will you ride until you die?
Will you ride until you die?

And do you hear my heart?
Do you feel it beating?
This love is indestructible
Do you hear my heart?
Do you feel it beating?
This love is indestructible

We'll be all right
Rebels of the night
Like Bonnie do with Clyde
Will you ride until you die?
Will you ride until you die?
Rebels of the night
Like Bonnie do with Clyde
Will you ride until you die?
Will you ride until you die?
