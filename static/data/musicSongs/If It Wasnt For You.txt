Lyrics:


Canât help but think sometimes
Baby about you and Iâ¨
What if weâd never metâ¨
That thought scares me to death
Rewind to that first look

And that little chance you took
You sure walked out on a limb
Oh Thank God you did
Knowing what Iâd do

[Chorus:]
If it wasnât for you
I wouldnât know what love isâ¨
Iâd still be walking roundâ¨
Looking into strangers faces part of a lonely crowdâ¨
Iâd still be dreaming dreams that never come true
If it wasnât for you

I wouldnât know what it meansâ¨
To have everythingâ¨
Someone that has my heart
No matter where they are
I wouldnât know what itâs likeâ¨
To go to sleep each nightâ¨
Lying here in the darkâ¨
The whole world in my armsâ¨
Feeling the way I you do

[Chorus:]
If it wasnât for you
I wouldnât know what love isâ¨
Iâd still be walking roundâ¨
Looking into strangers faces
Part of a lonely crowdâ¨
Iâd still dreaming dreams that never come true
If it wasnât for you
If it wasnât for you

This house wouldnât be a homeâ¨
Itâd just be doors and wallsâ¨
I wouldnât know the sound of laughterâ¨
Running up and down these hallsâ¨
Iâd still dreaming dreams that never come true
If it wasnât for you
