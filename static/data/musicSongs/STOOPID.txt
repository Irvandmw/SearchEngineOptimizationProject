Bitch, I'm silly
Up the chopper, shoot your shit up, let's get busy
Drinkin' Henny, goin' brazy, poppin' pillies
Sex Money Murda, shoutout all my blazing Billies (on Billy)
We in yo' city! (we in yo'!)

[6ix9ine & Bobby Shmurda:]
Shoutout my apes in the fuckin' roof (for real), for mayo they gon' shoot
Spin a hoop, who the fuck is you?

Niggas killed your cousin, you gon' smoke, nigga? (stupid!)

Shoutout my Bloods, shoutout my Crips

You know you like a nigga shmoney dance
You gon' love a nigga when I swerve out

[6ix9ine:]

Up the chopper, shoot your shit up, let's get busy
Drinkin' Henny, goin' brazy, poppin' pillies
Sex Money Murda, shoutout all my blazing Billies (on Billy)

Hold up, hold up, hold up gang
