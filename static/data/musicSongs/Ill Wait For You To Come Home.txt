Lyrics:


Love is sterling threads of gold
Treasure 'til the heart grows old
When my love you stole from me
You said I'd wait patiently

And wait for you to come home
I'll wait for you to come home
I need you so

With my heart you went away
Leaving your heart in its place
Flying softly in the breeze
I can hear you sing to me

I'll wait for you to come home, yeah
I'll wait for you to come home
I need you so

I need your love with me
If you are here or across the sea
Love me as I love you
And girl I know we'll see it through, yeah

Though we cry so far away
Tears of joy we'll see one day
In my dreams, you're close to me
I can hear you say to me

I'll wait for you to come home, yeah
I'll wait for you to come home
I need you so

They can't keep you away
I'll find the road to you someday
And baby, the day I do
I'll make our every wish come true, oh yeah

I will never say goodbye
Even though my heart may cry
Oh, wait, the world must be a fool
I will sit and dream of you

And wait for you to come home, yeah
I'll wait for you to come home
I need you so

I need you so
Need you so
