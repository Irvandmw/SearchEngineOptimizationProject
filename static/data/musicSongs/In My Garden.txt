Lyrics:


I don't even deserve it
What I get, I can't believe I earned it
What you said I can't believe I heard it
Been a fact, no matter what the verdict
I'm all I ever needed
If you cut my hands like I'm defeated
They grow back if I'm mistreated
In my garden, in my garden

Where I come from, we don't cry over none
I come from where a few get a chance to be loved
Travel the world
Where I come from I just don't have the time to be miserable

Can't you just smile for me
Can't you just smile, baby, for me
Smile, baby, for me
Smile
Smile
Smile
Smile

Patiently
I wait for the sun to rise, to rise
I ain't goin' after perfect
Every broken wing is not a burden
Baby, don't complain about your hurtin'
'Cause we know there's always room to worsen
When your roots are bein' eaten
Just know it's good to be receedin'
In my garden, in my garden
In my garden, in my garden oh

Where I come from, we don't cry over none
I come from where a few get a chance to be loved
Travel the world
Where I come from I just don't have the time to be miserable

Can't you just smile for me
Can't you just smile, baby, for me
Smile
Smile
Smile
Smile
Smile
Smile
Patiently
Wait for the sun to rise
