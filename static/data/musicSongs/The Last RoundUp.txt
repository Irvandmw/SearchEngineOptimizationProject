I gonna saddle old pink for the last time and ride
So long old pal it's time your tears withdry
Well I'm a headin' for the last roundup
Now git along little doggie git along git along little doggie git along
Yeah git along little doggie git along git along little doggie git along
Well I'm a headin' for the last roundup
Git along little doggie...
I gonna saddle old pink...
