Lyrics:


Went to O'Malley's but the place was gone
No tables open at the other restaurant
Drove to the movie, it was all sold out
So, I said, "Baby, where to now?"

Line at the bar was just too damn long
That DJ wouldn't even play our song
You pulled your lips away from mine, and said
"Come away with me, run away with me"

And the moon is high
And the salt on your skin tastes sweet
And the firelights
Got nothing on you and me
Look around, it's all we could ever need
It's going down and we got a front-row seat
We got a front-row seat

Let's breathe it in, take it all in slow
Let's ride it high above the world below
This is my idea of wasting time
Now you're mine, yeah, you're all mine

And the moon is high
And the salt on your skin tastes sweet
And the firelights
Got nothing on you and me
Look around, it's all we could ever need
It's going down and we got a front-row seat
We got a front-row seat

It's going down, going down, yeah, it's going down
Look around, look around, baby, look around
It's going down, going down, yeah, it's going down
Oh, oh, oh

And the moon is high
And the salt on your skin tastes sweet
And the firelights
Got nothing on you and me
Look around, it's all we could ever need
It's going down and we got a front-row seat
We got a front-row seat

It's going down, going down, yeah, it's going down
Look around, look around, baby, look around
It's going down, going down, yeah, it's going down
Oh, oh, oh
