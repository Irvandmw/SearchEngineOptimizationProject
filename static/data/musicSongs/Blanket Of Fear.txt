Lyrics:


I am awake under this blanket of fear, and I must say, none of the people I see belong here, now everyone's asleep, I am
awake and I am dreaming, I believe it's time for a rude awakening

[Chorus]
So hold on to your dreams, Because your nightmares might seem like they're your reality Hold on to your dreams, Because
your nightmares might seem like they're your reality

I believe, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, and the man behind the curtain, I heard him say, "Dreamers have
become an endangered species, and I am aware of the rude awakening

[Chorus]

I'm falling in my dream I finally hit the ground,I'm falling in my dream I finally hit the ground, I hit the ground,
because I, I can't keep my mind from going into dark places, because I, I can't keep my mind from going into dark places

[Chorus]

I'm falling in my dream I finally hit the ground, I'm falling in my dream I finally hit the ground!
