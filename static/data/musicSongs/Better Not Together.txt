Lyrics:


Uuuhh Uuuhh Uuhmm
Love is lost, where is it to be found?
My heart is still here
Do we have to go round and round?
And all the time I was loving you faithfully
And you took my love, and you turned it around on me

Now I donât wanna fight with you
Iâve done everything I can do
Donât you leave me like that
I just want my girl back
Can we work it out?, or was it over ?

What are we doing? [x2]
Why canât we seem to work things out?
What are we doing? [x2]
Did we forget what love was about?
Feels like Iâm losing [x2]
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize
We are just better not together

Itâs hard to let go
Girl weâve been through so many things
But for you to grow
You have to go and spread your wings
I see your tears
You are searching for a brighter day
And you should have thought it through
When you gave my love away

Now I donât wanna fight with you
Iâve done everything I can do
I hate to leave you like that
But I thought you had my back
We tried to work it out, but itâs over

What are we doing? [x2]
Why cant we seem to work things out? (Was you and me together)
What are we doing [x2]
Did we forget what love was about?
Feels like Iâm losing [x2]
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize
We are just better not together

Girl itâs just too much for me to say
You to tell me that you love me
And then to watch you walk away
But girl the way we fight
It just ainât right
Thatâs why itâs better this way (Yeah yeah yeah)
Now no what else to say
But girl you know that
I still love you
yeahhhhh

What are we doing?
Why cant we seem to work things out?
What are we doing? [x2]
Did we forget what love was about? (Come on baby)
Feels like Iâm losing [x2]
But that was everything for me
But now I realize
We are just better not together

Iâve realized
We are just better
Not together
