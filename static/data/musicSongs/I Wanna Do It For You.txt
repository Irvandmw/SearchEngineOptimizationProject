Lyrics:


You've been trying to find your true love
On the verge of giving up
Tired of your heart breaking
You've almost had enough
It's not supposed to be that hard
Maybe love is closer than you think

You could keep on looking for the rest of your life
I'll be what you're looking for

I'll give you something more
Take you to a place you never been, never been
Show you something true that's what you deserve
Whatever I have to do, I wanna do it for you
Yeah

Remember I'm the one to get you on your feet
Ain't it funny how you turned to me
When you're feeling incomplete
I always helped you take a breath
Now I just wanna take your breath away

I've heard you saying that you need someone like me
Baby, open up that door

I'll give you something more
Take you to a place you never been, never been
Show you something true that's what you deserve
Whatever I have to do, I wanna do it for you
Yeah

I won't hold nothing back, baby, nothing at all
Catch you with loving arms if you're ready to fall

I'll give you something more
Take you to a place you never been, never been
Show you something true that's what you deserve
Whatever I have to do, I wanna do it for you
I wanna do it for you

I won't hold nothing back, I wanna do it for you
Listen, baby, I'll give you everything
I wanna do it for you
Do it for you
