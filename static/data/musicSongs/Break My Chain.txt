Lyrics:


Oh won't you break my chain, don't turn me down
I got a body full of pain, I'm tired of being your clown
Oh there's a whole lotta fishes
In the deep blue sea, blue sea, blue sea
Baby don't keep 'em waiting, 'cause they're waitin' for me

At the drive-in-movie, every place in town
People see you with another, out runnin' around
Oh well the coal in the fireplace
Ain't gonna burn no more, no more, no more
Won't you break my chain, baby open that door

Oh won't you break my chain, baby set me free
'Cause I've had about enough of this misery
You've been spendin' my cash, talkin' that trash
All over town
Won't you break my chain, don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Baby don't turn me down
