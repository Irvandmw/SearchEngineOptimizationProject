Lyrics:


Oh-whoa

You don't know where you're going 'til it's gone
And you don't realize the damage 'til it's done
Think you got time, runnin' 'round, you just having fun
All the while, know the demons that harmed you won't leave you alone
I've been by myself, tryna heal my wounds
It ain't all about me, know you got yours too (Yours too)
Take another shot, tryna get my mind right (Oh, oh)

I've been praying and bleeding
And begging and pleading to find out, yeah
With my back to the wall, all my fears
Need to hear from God now

'Cause when it all comes crashing down on me, yeah
And when the world turn they back, it's up to me, yeah
All my flaws and sins, that's all they see, yeah
And when it all falls down, it's all on me
It's all on me, it's all on me (Yeah)

All these wrongs that I've done, I'm just tryna make it right
But my insecurities keep me laying up at night
Nobody's perfect but I do my best
To keep a smile for the camera, but I'm a mess (Oh-oh)

I've been praying and bleeding
And begging and pleading to find out (Find out), yeah
With my back to the wall, all my fears
Need to hear from God now

'Cause when it all comes crashing down on me, yeah
And when the world turn they back, it's up to me, yeah (Oh-oh-oh)
All my flaws and sins, that's all they see, yeah (That's all they see, yeah)
And when it all falls down, it's all on me (Oh-oh)
It's all on me (It's all, it's all, it's all)
(Girl, bring it all on me)
It's all on me, yeah (Oh, it's always on me, on me)

No-no, no-no, no
Yeah, it's on all night
