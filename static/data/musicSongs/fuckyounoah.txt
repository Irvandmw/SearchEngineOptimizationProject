Lyrics:


(We got London On Da Track)

I'm a narcissist
I can't co-exist
One plus one equals me
And truth is I'm in love with it
'Cause I'm a narcissist
That's just what it is
No one fucks with me
'Cause no one ever fucking loves a bitch

I ain't no good at love
I always fuck it up
I keep on going and going
Until they've had enough
I ain't so good at love
I always fuck it up
I keep on going and going
Until they've given up

I ain't no band aid for your heart
'Cause I'm the one that's leaving all your scars and
I can't revive you 'less I say bye to you
I ain't no band aid for your heart

Yeah, I'm a hypocrite
I'll probably never quit
I never practice what I preach
I do the opposite
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit
It makes me hard to miss
No one wants to be around
Another fucking hypocrite

I ain't no band aid for your heart
'Cause I'm the one that's leaving all your scars and
I can't revive you 'less I say bye to you
I ain't no band aid for your heart

I ain't no good at love
I always fuck it up
I keep on going and going
Until they've had enough
I ain't so good at love
I always fuck it up
I keep on going and going
Until they've given up

I ain't no band aid for your heart
'Cause I'm the one that's leaving all your scars and
I can't revive you 'less I say bye to you
I ain't no band aid for your heart

I ain't no band aid for your heart
'Cause I'm the one that's leaving all your scars and
I can't revive you 'less I say bye to you
I ain't no band aid for your heart
