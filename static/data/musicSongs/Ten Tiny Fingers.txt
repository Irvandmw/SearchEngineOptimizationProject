Lyrics:


Ten tiny fingers, ten tiny toes
I thought I knew about love
But I didn't know
No no, I didn't know

My newborn daughter
Lay in my arms
And I was a fool for all her charms
But no no no, I didn't know

I was a patsy, I was a dupe
I couldn't think
My brains had turned to soup
I couldn't speak, but my heart
Began to whoop
It's the age-old story

Ten tiny fingers, ten tiny toes
Let you know that, you don't know
No no, you don't know

Now I've been a father
For twenty one years
And any time I thought
I could hold love
It disappeared, it disappeared

And while I'm thinking
How far I've come
I find I'm back where I started
Oh no, I didn't know

Ten tiny fingers, ten tiny toes
Your daddy's ears and your mummy's nose
That's as far as my knowledge goes
What I see before me are

Ten tiny fingers, ten tiny toes
Let you know that you don't know
No no, you don't know
