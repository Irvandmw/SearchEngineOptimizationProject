Lyrics:


It's dark in the day
And I'll say
Now don't complain
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away
You're so afraid to cry
But your heart be feeling dry
It's time to change

But you keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering
Why you keep thundering
Won't you just rain and get it over with

When I feel the pain
Now, babe, I won't complain
I hear you say
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away
And now we're so afraid to cry
But when you need a wave to ride
That's the way

You keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering
Why you keep thundering
Won't you just fucking rain and get it over with

And get it over with
I see you rolling in (the clouds)
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again (in the clouds)
Roll up and go again
I see you rolling in (the clouds)
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again (in the clouds)
Roll up and go again

It's alright we can roll in the clouds
Getting high we can float in the clouds
It's alright we can roll in the clouds
Getting high we can float in the clouds
It's alright we can roll in the clouds
Getting high we can float in the clouds

You keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering
Why you keep thundering
Won't you just fucking rain and get it over with

And get it over with
And get it over with

No, no, no, we should be lighting it up
No, no, no, we should be lighting it up
No, no, no, we should be lighting it up
No, no, no, we should be lighting it up
Start it with lightning

(It's alright we can roll in the clouds
And get it over with
Getting high we can float in the clouds
And get it over with)

We should be lighting it up
We should be lighting it up
We should be lighting it up
Start it with lightning

It's dark in the day
And I'll say
Now don't complain
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away
