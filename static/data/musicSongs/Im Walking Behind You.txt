Lyrics:


I'm walking behind you on your wedding day
And I'll hear you promise to love and obey
Though you may forget me, you're still on my mind
Look over your shoulder, I'm walking behind

Maybe I'll kiss again with a love that's new again
But I shall wish again, I was kissing you

'Cause I'll always love you where ever you go
And though we are parted, I want you to know
That if things go wrong, dear and fate is unkind
Look over your shoulder, I'm walking behind

So if things go wrong, dear and fate is unkind
Look over your shoulder, I'm walking behind
