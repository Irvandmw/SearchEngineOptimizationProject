Lyrics:


[Hook: Future]
Itâs over 25 girls in my section
Lets make a movie tonight, you wonât regret it
Fo real, Fo real
You know the money bring the cars, the cars bring the hoes
Rockstar life, thats how it goes
Fo real Fo real

[Bridge: Future]
We got that drink, hell yeah we got that drink
They wanna pop champagne, yeah they wanna drink
Fo real, Fo real

[Verse 1: Future]
They wish they were rockstars like us
I bet you wishing they could get fly like us
The same gang of niggas in here with money on us
We got them mollies in here, they mix that Xan and that Tuss
Ainât go to church this Sunday but I had church
I paid my tithes with them strippers, bought the bitch a purse
Iâm on a whole other planet, never on the Earth
I brought my whole hood with me and we goinâ berserk

[Bridge: Future]

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Even though I used to act, man, this shit is not a act, nigga
I have never lied on a track, only facts, nigga
A lot of people willinâ to back that, and if you backtrack
I spoke about this cominâ to fruition in my raps, nigga
Yeah; then it happened, nigga, wassup, nigga?
You just jealous, you just bitter, shut the fuck up
This that I been on a roll shit, Iâm back on my old shit
416, we know your bitch, that Free Band OVO shit, foâ real.

[Verse 3: Future]
I be splurginâ, Christian Dior, I got Chanel on order
I met that girl and had to spoil her âcause that girlâs so loyal
I met her when she was a dime and turned into a quarter
We drank champagne just like itâs water, drink that liquor like water
Nigga told me: ho bitch â thatâs when I went hard
I bought some guns, I bought some ice and bought some more lawyers
You try and take what I done sacrificed and worked hard for
Iâm in that mode, Iâm in that zone like when a nigga raw
Iâm celebratinâ every day, goddamn it I could be starvinâ
Letâs have a toast to all my niggas runninâ up in apartments
We had a good year this year, we made a lot of fortunes
And we very fortunateâ¦

[Bridge: Future]
