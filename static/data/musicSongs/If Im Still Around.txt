Lyrics:


And so we meet again
So we meet again
My young learned friend
Did you mean to take this path?
'Cos I meant to take this path
I know it makes you laugh

I know it makes you laugh 
When we meet here on this path
So I choose to take this path
And you choose to take this path

Does beauty fill your world?
Does beauty fill your world?
My beautiful girl
'Cos I can see the world
I can see the world
When I watch you swirl

Does beauty fill your world?
My beautiful girl
'Cos I can see the world
When I watch you swirl

You're dancing rings round me
You're dancing rings round me
I think we both agree
So I lie here on the floor
I lie here on the floor
So I can watch you more

You're dancing rings round me
I think we both agree
So I lie here on the floor
So I can watch you more

Ten years from today
Ten years from today
You'll be far away
And if I'm still around
If I'm still around
I'll walk this blessed ground
Ten years from today
You'll be far away
And if I'm still around
I'll walk this blessed ground

If I'm still, if I'm still
If I'm still, if I'm still around
If I'm still, if I'm still
If I'm still, if I'm still around
