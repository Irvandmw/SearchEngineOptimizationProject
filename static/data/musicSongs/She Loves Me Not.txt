Lyrics:


When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize
That she could see inside my head

So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate
So I don't have to lose my head

This situation
Leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I don't know
If I care
I'm a jerk
Life's not fair

Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers
And watched my fears
Fly away

And until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say
Sometimes she says she loves me not

But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over

I don't know
If I care
I'm a jerk
Life's not fair

Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Life's not fair
I'm a jerk

Line for line
Rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fightin' all the goddamn time
It's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid
Mad on the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl
We're tearing up each other's world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's alright baby we can scream and shout

I don't know
If I care
I'm a jerk
Life's not fair

Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Life's not fair
Life's not fair
Life's not fair

I'm a jerk

Life's not fair

She loves me not
Loves me not
