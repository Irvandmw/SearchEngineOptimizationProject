Lyrics:


I don't wanna be no soldier - I don't wanna shoot no gun
I don't wanna drop no bomb - I don't wanna hurt no one
I don't wanna fight no battles - I don't wanna settle no score
I don't even understand - what we're fightin' for
No it ain't my war

That's the way of the world - that's what they tell me
That's the way of the world - they can't sell me
That's the way of the world - I can't explain it
That's the way of the world - but we can change it

We're burnin up the ozone layer - we're walkin' on a real thin wire
Stirrin' up a hurricane - playin' with the devil's fire
Got a lot of dirty water - got a lot of dirty air
Got skeletons in the closet - but nobody looks in there
'Cause they're all scared

That's the way of the world - that's what they tell me
That's the way of the world - they can't sell me
That's the way of the world - I can't explain it
That's the way of the world - but we can change it

I just wanna live in peace now - with my guitar and my girl
Raise a little family - that's way it's supposed to be
That's the way of the world - yeah
That's the way of the world
That's the way of the world

That's the way of the world - that's what they tell me
That's the way of the world - they can't sell me
That's the way of the world - I can't explain it
That's the way of the world - but we can change it

That's the way of the world
That's the way of the world
