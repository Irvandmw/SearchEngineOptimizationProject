Lyrics:


Today tomorrow forever (ooo ah)
You are the one girl I love (tatatatatatata uuh)
As long as stars shine above (the stars that shine, the stars that shine)
This is no mere infatuation (1234 we love your voice so sing some more)
This time it's real the sweet sensation (uuh uuh uuh uuh)
Always and always together (tatatatatatatata)
That's how it's fated to be (bong bong bong bong)
Today tomorrow forever
You are the one girl for me
(You are my one love)
