Lyrics:


I know

Now it only seems like yesterday
When the dreams I had were all wrapped up in you
And it's funny how much a love can change
But some things never leave your heart, it's true

Ooh, right out of nowhere
Ooh, I hear that song again

And in a flashback
Suddenly I'm with you
I know that
I never had a love so true
And in that moment
Everything hits so hard
I'm broken
Trying to get over you

I was walking around with my chest up high
Spring in my step and a gleam in my eye
I was over you, so over you
Now they go round and around and around my head
Three simple words that I should've said
I should've let you know, but I let you go

Do you know how much you meant to me?
If I could turn back time, I'd tell you every day
This wasn't how it was meant to be
And deep inside my heart, I still feel the pain

Ooh, I didn't want to go there
But they're playing that song,
they're playing that song again

And in a flashback
Suddenly I'm with you
I know that
I never had a love so true
And in that moment
Everything hits so hard
I'm broken
Trying to get over you

I was walking around with my chest up high
Spring in my step and a gleam in my eye
I was over you, so over you
Now they go round and around and around my head
Three simple words that I should've said
I should've let you know, but I let you go

I tried so hard to hide it
Keep it all locked up inside
Still I can't forget you
No matter how hard I try

And in a flashback
Suddenly I'm with you
I know that
I never had a love so true
And in a moment
Everything hits so hard
I'm broken
Trying to get over you

I was walking around with my chest up high
Spring in my step and a gleam in my eye
(I know) I was over you, so over you
Now they go round and around and around my head
Three simple words that I should've said
I should've let you know
But I let you go
