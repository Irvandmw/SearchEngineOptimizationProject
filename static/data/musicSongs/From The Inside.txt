Lyrics:


Iâm searching for the cure
An antidote to heal me
Oh desperately I try to chase
Away the lines that haunt my face
But the truth wins every time

The lights are coming on
All the glitz is gone
Iâm staring at the view from the inside

So this is the real me
I donât like what I see
Staring at the view from the inside

So welcome to my world
The ultimate illusion
Iâve hidden in words and melodies
Now theyâre coming back on me
Yeah, the hand they bite is mine

The lights are coming on
All glitz is gone
Iâm staring at the view from the inside

So this is the real me
I donât like what I see
Staring at the view from the inside

Trying hard to just get by
But blessedly Iâm failing

The lights are clearly on
All the glitz is gone
Iâm staring at the view from the inside

So this is the real me
Do you like what you see
Staring at the view from the inside
From the inside
