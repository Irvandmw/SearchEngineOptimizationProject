Lyrics:


Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire ohhhh I'm on fire
Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do oh
I can take you higher ohhhh I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire ohhhh I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire ohhhh I'm on fire
Ohhhh I'm on fire
Ohhhh I'm on fire
Ohhhh I'm on fire
