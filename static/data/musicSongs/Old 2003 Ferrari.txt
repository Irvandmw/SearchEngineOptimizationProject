Lyrics:


[Chorus:]
Niggas say they like my old shit
So I give them some old shit
What the fuck do I care, its old
Shit Iâll give them some old shit
No, Iâll give them some new shit
Iâll just use my old flow
Looky here muthafucker Iâm not playing
Look, look
Looky here muthafucker Iâm not playing
Look, look

[Verse 1:]
Wassup,
Itâs âO11 why that Maybach an â06
This nigga boo booed up with my old bitch
I put paper before hoes, thats why Iâm so rich
I paved the way, long dick, now we all fit
Doc check my temperature, why Iâm so cold?
The hood left the left side of my chest froze
Iâm more about pimpinâ gettinâ bank rolls
Sitting watch em trickinâ on them stank hoes
We can share love like Kanye and Khalifa
From runways in Milan to big bags of reefer
She alright for a night but donât keep her
Ask Nas, Kelis was the illest Ether

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
My belt buckle YSL, my denim vintage
My AP all iced out, my shit authentic
My bread come in by the boat load, thats how I get it
The cops come, say I aint do what you know I did it
I aint trippinâ, na-na-na-na I aint trippinâ
I am just putting the clip in
I aint at the window looking bitch
I am legend, I am lethal with the weapon
I am 50, Iâm putting an end to niggas fucking with me
Yeah, I am back, I am ruler with a iron fist
I am strapped, what yâall niggas gon do with this
Wordplay all day, they say I got a gift
One shot from the fifth, niggas career shift

[Chorus]
