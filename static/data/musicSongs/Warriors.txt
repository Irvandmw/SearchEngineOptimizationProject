Lyrics:


We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 

It feels like we are headed for a meltdown
I'm sweating as the seconds start to run out
I know that there's a glitch in the system
We're breaking down the walls of this prison 

We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 

Shine your light 
Push the enemy back
When you're under attack
It will protect you
Kill the night 
All we need is a spark
We can bury the dark
Ignite â Come on and shine your light

We throw our misery in the inferno
Illuminate our lives we are eternal
United in a head on collision 
We sacrifice ourselves for the mission 

We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 

Shine your light 
Push the enemy back
When you're under attack
It will protect you
Kill the night 
All we need is a spark
We can bury the dark
Ignite â Come on and shine your light
Come on and shine your light

Madness karma  
Surrounds me as a follower
Bad shit happens to all of us
Is actually a fabric â a garment 
You know I didn't last this long 
Being anything less than a warrior
Average â no â Savage 
Better that than a has been â a goner
Look up the lord tell em shine your light

We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 

Shine your light 
Push the enemy back
When you're under attack
It will protect you
Kill the night 
All we need is a spark
We can bury the dark
Ignite â Come on and shine your light 

We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
Come on and shine your light 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
We are the warriors 
Come on and shine your light
