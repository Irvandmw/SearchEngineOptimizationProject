Lyrics:


I found your picture looking through a book
It was the one I took
When we were driving on Sunset
Descendents playing on a mix CD
That you just made for me
You wrote ââFor when you miss meâ on it

I canât stop myself when I listen
I always sing along
Reliving every minute
And I just canât take it

I wish that I could forget you even exist
And find a way to, be without you
âCause I miss you and I hate feeling like this
Itâs making me sick
Feeling nostalgic
Every year when October comes around
And it gets colder out
I grab my favourite hoodie
Thereâs still a hole from when you borrowed it
You used to sleep in it
âCause it reminded you of me

Canât stop myself when Iâm thinking
I only see your face
Reliving every minute
And I just canât take it

Maybe someday my heart will be over it
Maybe someday Iâll be ok
But I miss you and I hate feeling like this
Itâs making me sick
Feeling Nostalgic
