Lyrics:


Fat man lookinâ in a blade of steel
Thin man lookinâ at his last meal
Hollow man lookinâ in a cotton field
For dignity

Wise man lookinâ in a blade of grass
Young man lookinâ in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookinâ through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Yearâs Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchinâ high, searchinâ low
Searchinâ everywhere I know
Askinâ the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breakinâ out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopinâ to find one circumstance
Of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary Lou
She said, âI donât want nobody see me talkinâ to youâ
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I wouldâve gone deeper, but there wasnât any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasnât any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinkinâ man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Lookinâ into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said heâd give me information if his name wasnât used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

Footprints runninâ âcross the silver sand
Steps goinâ down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the bordertowns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat
Iâm on the rollinâ river in a jerkinâ boat
Tryinâ to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man lookinâ for the doctorâs cure
Lookinâ at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combinâ his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, Iâm at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what itâs gonna take
To find dignity
