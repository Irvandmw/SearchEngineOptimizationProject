Lyrics:


1, 2, a 1, 2, 3, 4
Oh, I've got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rockin' she's a queen
Love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone, I can hold her tight
But she lives on a twentieth floor up town
The elevator's broken down

So I climbed one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I started to drag
By the fifteenth floor I'm ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

She called me up on the telephone
She said c'mon over, Cause I'm all alone
I said baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in the bed with a-achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days
(But I) But I couldn't stay away

So I claimed two, three, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I'm starting to drag
By the fifteenth floor I ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

Sent to Glasgow for repairs
'Till it's fixed I'm using the stairs
I hope they hurry up before it's too late
Because I don't want my baby too much to wait
All this climbin' is gettin' me down
You'll find my corpse draped over the rail

But I climbed two, three, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I'm starting to drag
By the fifteenth floor I ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

Yeah, I climbed two, three, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I'm starting to drag 
By the fifteenth floor I ready to sag
Get to the top, but I'm too tired
Get to the top, but I'm too tired 
Get to the top, but I'm too tired to rock
