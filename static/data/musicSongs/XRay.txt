Lyrics:


[Hook:]
Iâm looking through you like an x-ray
Iâm trying to figure if your loveâs fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

Beaming through your door
I see right through your faults
Eyes tryna feed me more lies
Girl Iâm on top, of all your little side plans
All your little side mans
All in for your waist and I must have been out my mind

[Pre-Hook:]
Girl you had to be so slick to go through all them
Bad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause

[Hook x2]

Running through them boys
You play me like a toy
And 'bout to here that noise
When I find out your thoughts girl
Sweating on the outside shaking on the inside
Girl Iâm reading your mind (and it's filled with lies)

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook x2]

Girl you're out of love
(Girl You Know you're out of love so)
Packed up all your stuff
Girl you had your chance but
This time, this time was your last

[Hook x2]
