Lyrics:


All the things that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now, baby, I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to upset our happy home

Oh, don't get so excited
When I come home a little late at night
Cause we only act like children
When we argue, fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me

We've all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman you've got yours, too
Just trust in me, like I trust in you
As long as we've been together, it should be so easy to do

Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye?

If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me

If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me
