Lyrics:


It was you, made me cry
Made me wait through those long lonely nights
Every tear from my eyes
Was a waste, till I ran out of stars in the sky

Honey you know that I ain't got no patience
Baby I'd wait a hundred years and more

'Cause you're worth waiting for
You're worth waiting for
And I'm grateful I ain't got to wait no more
You're worth waiting for
No more crying anymore
And I'd do it all again for a love like yours
You're worth waiting for

Baby you're worth waiting for
Baby you're worth waiting (waiting)
Baby you're worth waiting for
Baby you're worth waiting

How could you even know?
I was mad, you weren't there when I needed you most

Now honey you know that I ain't got no patience
And baby I'd wait a hundred years and more

'Cause you're worth waiting for (waiting for)
You're worth waiting for
And I'm grateful I ain't got to wait no more
Baby you're worth waiting for
No more crying anymore (anymore)
And I'd do it all again for a love like yours
You're worth waiting for

And it's about time, it's about time baby (woo, oh yeah, say)
Said it's about time, it's about time baby (hey, he is so fricking cool, oh, say)
Said it's about time, it's about time baby (he's so cool right?, uh)
Said it's about time, it's about time baby (oh, woo)

And honey you know that I ain't got no patience
Baby I'd wait a hundred years and more

'Cause you're worth waiting for
You're worth waiting for (waiting for)
And I'm grateful I ain't got to wait no more
Baby you're worth waiting for (waiting for)
No more crying anymore (no more)
And I'd do it all again for a love like yours
You're worth waiting for

Baby you're worth waiting for
Baby you're worth waiting (waiting, oh)
Baby you're worth waiting for (waiting for)
Baby you're worth waiting (oh no, no)
Baby you're worth waiting for
Baby you're worth waiting (you're worth waiting for)
Baby you're worth waiting for (no, no)
Baby you're worth waiting
You're worth waiting for
