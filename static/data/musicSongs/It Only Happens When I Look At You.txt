Lyrics:


It happens every time I look into your eyes
I can almost see in your heart
How can I explain, when time and time again, it starts?

It only happens when I look at you... oh, baby
Oh, it only happens, yeah, yeah, when I look at you, oh, oh

I wonder if you know things I'm going through
Can't you see my love depends on you?
Believe me when I say it gets stronger everyday - oh, heart is true

Oh, oh, it only happens, oh, baby, when I look at you
You're looking good to me, baby
It only happens, oh-ah, when I look at you, yeah

Play it pretty now... what you feelin'

Oh, oh, it only happens, ooh, baby, oh, baby, when I look at you
Ooh-wee, baby, ooh-wee, baby
It only happens, oh! when I look at you, yeah

Well! I guess you know the way that I feel about you now
I wonder if you feel the same way too
Oh, baby, now no matter what you say, let me get to you someday - oh, heart is true

Oh, oh, it only happens, oh, oh, when I look at you
Oh, baby, oh, oh, baby, it only happens, oh, oh, when I look at you
Ooh-wee, baby
It only happens, oh, baby, when I look at you, when I look at you, when I'm lookin' at you, ooh, baby it's true
It only happens, oh, oh, oh, when I look at you
What I mean is don't you be so doggone mean, I mean
It happens... oh! every time I look at you
Yeah, baby, oh, baby, ooh, baby
It happens... Oh! Oh! Oh
Oh! Oh! Oh
It only happens... Lord have mercy now - when I look at you, yeah
Would you lay it on me, baby?
It only happens... oh, baby, oh, baby, when I look at you, when I look at you, when I'm lookin' at you, don't you know it's true?
It only happens, every, every, every, every time I look at you
Oh, baby, oh, oh, baby
It only happens
