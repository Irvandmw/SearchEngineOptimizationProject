Lyrics:


Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon
Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon
We could float among the stars together you and I
For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away in my beautiful
My beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky
For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away in my beautiful
My beautiful balloon

Suspended under the twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hide us
People lean beside us

Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Away up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you hold my hand we'll chase a dream
Across the sky for we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away in my beautiful 
My beautiful balloon

Yes, my pretty balloon
My balloon, my balloon
