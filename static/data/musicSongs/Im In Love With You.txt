Lyrics:


[DM] I'm in love with you
[DM] But you're in love with Jim [MW] I am huh-uh
[MW] Jim's in love with Joan
[MW] But Joan is gone on Slim
[DM] Slim just goes for Mae
[DM] And Mae idolizes Fred
[MW] But Fred dreams of the day that he and Kay will wed

[DM] We're on a carrousel turning at a busy pace
[MW] Well everyone's in love and no one's getting any place
[DM] What's this I hear about Kay
[MW] Oh Kay's in love with Dan
[MW] But Dan's in love with Sue
[DM] Sue says I'm her man [MW] says I'm her man
[DM] But I've got news for Sue
[DM] I'm in love with you

[DM] I went out with Sue
[DM] So Dan went back to Kay
[MW] Fred became so blue
[MW] That he went back to Mae
[DM] Then Mae got on the phone
[DM] To kind of patch things up with Slim
[MW] Slim went back to Joan
[MW] But she'd gone back to Jim
[DM] Jim figured you and Joan complicated normal life
[MW] I know what you mean
[MW] So he said goodbye and then he went back to his wife
[DM] Then when you could see that you and Jim were through
[DM] You came back to me
[DM] And I've got news for you
[Both] I'm in love with you yes I'm in love with you
