[Intro]
Oh yeah
DaBaby, ayy
DaBaby, ayy
Yeah
Firzt on the track

[Chorus]
Come fuck with me, I'm drippin' flavor (I'm drippin' sauce today)
I turned it up on all my haters (I turnt up all the way)
You know I'm all about the paper (I'm all about the cake)
And if you're not I'll see you later (Get up out the way)
I had to stay down for a minute, now I'm rocking gold like I'm African (Now I'm rocking gold)
I'm always on the road with my savages (Always on the road)
Pourin' out my soul, I'm so passionate (Out my soul)
While you were splurging on them hoes, I was stackin' it (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1]
I do this thing when they met me, I swear to God, they be in love with lil' Baby
They all keep on jockin' my style, I got so much flavor it's gettin' contagious
Fell off and went broke for a while, now I'm right back up and this shit is amazing
You know I smoke that shit out the pound, you fuck around, think a young nigga Jamaican
And we gon' go all out to get it, no we never had it, the squad we the realest
You spending your money on all of them bitches
You splurge on them hoes, I'ma stack it and flip it
Now I got 'em mad and they all in they feelings
I'm countin' up cash, I'm just laughing, they chillin'
Back in '94, knew I wanted a million, nigga

[Chorus]
Come fuck with me, I'm drippin' flavor (I'm drippin' sauce today)
I turned it up on all my haters (I turnt up all the way)
You know I'm all about the paper (I'm all about the cake)
And if you're not I'll see you later (Get up out the way)
I had to stay down for a minute, now I'm rocking gold like I'm African (Now I'm rocking gold)
I'm always on the road with my savages (Always on the road)
Pourin' out my soul, I'm so passionate (Out my soul)
While you were splurging on them hoes, I was stackin' it (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
I just flew out to Las Vegas to fuck up some change on a little vacation
I had to stay down for the squad, the ones that stay loyal when niggas was hatin'
They heard that lil' Baby got robbed, well somebody gave them the wrong information
You know they couldn't finish the job, I lit his ass up, thought that boy was a gangster
They must've forgot I went rockin', ran off on the plug, hit the mall and go shopping
Keep runnin' from bitches, got so many options 'cause that what you get when you finally poppin'
Everybody switchin' but I'm never stoppin'
Niggas act like bitches, I can feel them watchin'
Niggas just pretending that they got a problem, pussy

[Chorus]
Come fuck with me, I'm drippin' flavor (I'm drippin' sauce today)
I turned it up on all my haters (I turnt up all the way)
You know I'm all about the paper (I'm all about the cake)
And if you're not I'll see you later (Get up out the way)
I had to stay down for a minute, now I'm rocking gold like I'm African (Now I'm rocking gold)
I'm always on the road with my savages (Always on the road)
Pourin' out my soul, I'm so passionate (Out my soul)
While you were splurging on them hoes, I was stackin' it (Oh yeah)
