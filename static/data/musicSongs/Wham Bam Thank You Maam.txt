Lyrics:


(Wham bam thank you ma'am I hope you're satisfied)
I never knew what love would do 'til I saw your smile
And when I did I flipped my lid and almost went plum wild
But now I know I'll never show my love to anyone
'cause wham bam you broke my heart and I hope that you had fun

(Wham bam thank you ma'am) Hope you're satisfied
You took my heart and tore it apart you hurt me deep inside
I'll never be a fool again you really crushed my pride
(Wham bam thank you ma'am) Hope you're satisfied

I looked at you and thought I knew just how the game was played
My shirt tail ran right up my back just like a window shade
I cross my heart I'll never start to pal for anyone
'cuz wham bam you broke my heart and hope that you had fun
(Wham bam thank you ma'am) Hope you're satisfied
You took my heart and you tore it apart you hurt me deep inside
I'll never be a fool again you really crushed my pride
(Wham bam thank you ma'am) and I hope you're satisfied

I made a mess of things I guess but now I'll recognize
The next young thing that tries to say its a love-light in her eye
The love light that you spoke about was only just a flame
'cuz every tome you meet a man it lights right up again
(Wham bam thank you ma'am) Hope you're satisfied
You took my heart and you tore it apart you hurt me deep inside
I'll never be a fool again you really crushed my pride
(Wham bam thank you ma'am) I hope you're satisfied
