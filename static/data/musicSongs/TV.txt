Lyrics:


You're all invited by
By something as good as me
You're frightened by my sentiment
What do you want to be?

You want to be my TV
Change your format 'til I say when
You want to feel my breathing
Take a dive into this deep end
And you walk across my ceiling
Trip and fall until I say when
You want to be my TV
Take dive into it

You're all divided by
Something as good as me
You're frightened by my sentiment 
What do you want to be?

You want to be my TV
Change your format 'til I say when
You want to feel my breathing
Take a dive into this deep end
And you walk across my ceiling
Trip and fall until I say when
You want to be my TV
Take dive into it

This soul is undecided...
This soul is undecided...

What do you want from me?
What do you want to be?
What do you want to be?
What do you want from me?
What do you want me to say? 
What do you want from me?
