Lyrics:


Every time you go away
It actually kinda makes my day
Every time you leave you slam the door

You pick your words so carefully
You hate to think you're hurting me
You leave me laughing on the floor

'Cause I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that

You know I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

I thought we were just hanging out
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth
You thought the way you taste would get me high

You went to all your friends to brag
Guys are always such a drag
Don't you know the reason that I kissed you was to say goodbye

'Cause I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that

You know I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

Hanging, hanging out
I am simply hanging, hanging out
I am simply hanging
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?

Why'd you kiss me?

Don't you know that I

I don't give a damn about you
I don't give a shit about you
I don't give a damn about you
I don't give a shit about you

I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
