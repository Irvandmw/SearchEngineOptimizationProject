Lyrics:


I wonder who's kissing her now? 
Wonder who's teaching her how? 
Wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs an' telling lies? 
I wonder who's buyin' the wine, for the lips that I used to call mine? 
Wonder if she ever tells him of me? 
I wonder who's kissing her now? 

I wonder who's buying the wine, for lips that I used to call mine? 
Wonder if she ever tells him of me? 
I wonder who's kissing... 
her now?
