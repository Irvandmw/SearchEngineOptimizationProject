Lyrics:


I liked where we were going
That feeling was a-growing
Everything started changing
In ways there's no explaining

Our love is sinking fast
I know that it can't last
White water

I thought it was forever
And you would leave me never
Love's fire is never burning
In my mind, bad thoughts are turning

And our love is sinking fast
I know that it can't last
White water

The world won't stop if we should ever part
Just two lost souls with a broken heart
No one will care if we go separate ways
So sweetheart hear what I say

It's time to do some talking
Before we both start walking
So let's stay together
Our lives will be better

Start right from this very day
To keep our love so far away from
White water
White water
White water
