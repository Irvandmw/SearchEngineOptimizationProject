Lyrics:


Out of a season
And into the cold
A new situation
And everything's old

It feels like I'm reaching
The end of the line
Cause we are running
Out of time

Traffic and stars
One in a million, all alone
We are so far away
Cause I never know how to
Handle the impossible you

I bend over backwards
Because of you
But you never showed me
The right thing to do

Roses and diamonds
You gave them right back
I fade like a shadow
Into the black

Traffic and stars
One in a million, all alone
We are so far away
Cause I never know how to
Handle the impossible you

What if I told you
You are the one
The one who can make me shine
I just wanna hold you
One more time

Traffic and stars
One in a million, all alone
We are so far away
Cause I never know how to
Handle the impossible you
Traffic and stars
One in a million, all alone
We are so far away
Cause I never know how to
Handle the impossible you
