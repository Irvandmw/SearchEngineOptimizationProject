Lyrics:


I may be wrong, but,
I think you're wonderful!
I may be wrong, but,
I think you're swell!

I like your style, say,
I think you're marvellous,
But I can't see
So how can I tell? 

All of my shirts are unsightly,
All of my ties are a crime,
If dear in you I've picked rightly,
It's the very first time!

You came along, say,
I think you're wonderful!
I think you're grand, but,
I may be wrong!

[instrumental bridge]

I may be wrong, but,
I think you're swell!

[instrumental bridge]

But I can't see
So how can I tell? 

All of my shirts are unsightly,
All of my ties are a crime,
If dear in you I've picked rightly,
It's the very first time!

You came along, say,
I think you're wonderful!
I think you're grand, but,
I may be wrong!
