Lyrics:


Hiding Away
Losin' the day
As if it doesn't really matter
Saying Goodbye
Scared to say why
Afraid it will shatter our world
Show me some faith now
Trust me somehow

Why are we keepin' our secret
Why are we hiding ourselves away
Anyway we can hide away
I dont wanna fake it
I wanna make you believe, what I say
I wont let you...hide away

Where do we go
How do we know
What we're ever really after
Sometimes it's clear
When you are here
Nothing can shatter our world
I need some faith now
To trust you somehow

Why are we keepin' our secret
Why are we hiding ourselves away
Anyway we can hide away
I dont wanna fake it
I wanna make you believe what I say
I wont let you...hide away

Maybe i, maybe i, maybe i'm losin'
Maybe i, maybe i, maybe i'm OK
Turn around, look around, go around in circles
Dont run away, drift away, dont hide away

Why are we keepin' our secret
Why are we hiding ourselves away
Anyway you can, hide away
I dont wanna fake it
I wanna make you believe what I say
Ohh what I say
Believe what i said
I wont let you hide away, hide away

Hiding away, losin' my day
As if it doesn't really matter
