Lyrics:


My life is a conversation
Between my body and my soul
No maps just destinations
To a place that can't be bought and won't be sold
In the darkness only questions
Still looking for the light of day
Every scar taught me a lesson
Yeah, I need you by my side to light the way

Come on let's go higher
When the ground around me crumbles
Come on let's go higher
I'm at the bottom of my heart
Come on let's go higher
I might fall and I might stumble
But right here and now is where the journey starts
Come on let's go higher

Entitlement like a cancer
God owes nothing to my soul
I keep looking for the easy answers
But it's the questions and the pain that makes you grow
The first time that I held my daughter
I heard angels down the hall
Like a tree digging for the water
It's the deeper you kneel down that makes you tall

Come on let's go higher
When the ground around me crumbles
Come on let's go higher
I'm at the bottom of my heart
Come on let's go higher
I might fall and I might stumble
But right here and now is where the journey starts
Come on let's go higher, and higher, yeah
Say it out loud, say it out loud
We are more than just our past mistakes
Say it out loud, say it out loud
More than the goods we accumulate
Say it out loud, say it out loud
I am more than just a number, priceless, born device-less and viceless
Born for more than just surviving this crisis
Singing Hallelujah nevertheless
Hallelujah nevertheless
Hallelujah nevertheless
Hallelujah nevertheless
Hallelujah nevertheless
Hallelujah nevertheless
(Through the flood and through the fight, you're still leading me singing)
Hallelujah nevertheless
Hallelujah nevertheless

Come on let's go higher
When the ground around me crumbles
Come on let's go higher
I'm at the bottom of my heart
Come on let's go higher
I might fall and I might stumble
But right here and now is where the journey starts
Come on let's go higher

Come on let's go higher
You're the river that's inside me
Come on let's go higher
You're the fire in my heart
Come on let's go higher
You're the compass left to guide me
And right here and now is where the journey starts
Come on let's go higher
