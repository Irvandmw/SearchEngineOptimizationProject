Lyrics:


You want to know if I care for you
You ought to know by now
How can you stand there just pretending
When you know how I feel?

Oh baby, you're my love
And I love everything you do to me, yeah
You're my love
And I love when you're around
You're my love
And I'll never let you down

You want to know what I see in you, oh
I can't really say for sure
All I know is that I need you, oh
More than I've ever needed anyone else before

Oh baby, you're my love
And I love everything you do to me
You're my love
And I love when you're around, yeah
You're my love, I love when you're around

Seasons changing faster than they did when we were young
It's funny but we didn't seem to care
The only thing we cared about was keeping our love strong
And as long as you're there, I'll always care

You're my love
I love what you do to me
You're my love
I love when you're around, oh baby

Honey, my love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stop your pretending, you know how I feel
I love you babe, love you babe, love you babe
Love you, love you, love you, yeah, yeah
Love you, I love you
I love you
I love you, I love you
I, I, I love you
You're my love, you're my love, yeah, oh yeah
