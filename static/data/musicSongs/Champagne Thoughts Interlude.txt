Lyrics:


I would like to make an announcement
To everybody that said I wouldn't amount to anything
In the minds of music
I told you, what did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you
Cause I told you
Mmhmm
And when did I tell you
A long time ago
And what did I say
What happen when I told you
Exactly what just happened

I love to jump up on the track
So poetic with the champagne
I'm sipping got me spitting moetic
The second I aim I det it
Now give me the credit
Cause I envision myself living in wealth
Breakfast at Tiffany's
Lunch at Louis V's
Now excuse me please
I got dinner plans overseas
Killin' with ease
Young Sinatra got your girl
And now she a Bobby Soxer
Girl with nice clothes
And thick curls
