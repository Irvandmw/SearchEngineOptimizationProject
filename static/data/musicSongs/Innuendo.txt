Lyrics:


One, two, three, four

While the sun hangs in the sky, and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars, and the rainbow
'Til the mountains crumble into the plain

Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying. Yeah
Just passing our time

While we live according to race, color or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on

Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying
We'll tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time

Through the sorrow, all through our splendor
Don't take offense at my innuendo

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be

Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego. Be free, be free to yourself

Ooh, ooh

If there's a god or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears, release your mask

Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey! Tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling. Yeah!
And whatever will be, will be

We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time
