Lyrics:


Oh, 
Some say that love isn't fair, 
But they don't know you and me, 
And when they tell me that love doesn't last that long, 
Thats when I look at you, 

And it's alright, 
Just let me lead you, 

It's okay if you close your eyes, 
I'll be standin by your side, 
I'm gonna love you the best that I can, 
You're my heart and you're my best friend, 
And I promise til the end, (yeah), 
I'm gonna love you the best that I can (that I can), 

Time cannot tear us apart (no, no, no), 
Were stronger than yesterday (yeah), 
And though we've travelled so far you're still close to me, 
Love changes everything, 

I know that it's alright, 
Just let me lead you (let me lead you), 
(Yeah) 

It's okay if you close your eyes (it's okay), 
I'll be standin by your side, 
I'm gonna love you the best that I can, 
You're my heart and you're my best friend, 
And I promise til the end (yeah), 
I'm gonna love you (gonna love you) the best that I can, 

You're the views and the valleys, 
You're not alone, 
And when the worlds upside down, 
You know, I'm there, 
And anytime I feel afraid, 
Thats when I look at you, 

With the best that I can, 
I will love you (I will love you), 
The very best I can 
(The best that I can), 
(With every breath I take) 
From this moment, til the very end, 
I'm gonna love you (gonna love you) the best that I can (the best that I can), 

It's okay if you close your eyes, 
I'll be standin by your side, 
I'm gonna love you the best that I can, 
You're my heart and you're my best friend (yeah), 
And I promise to the end, (yeah), 
I'm gonna love you the best that I can, 
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you), 

The best that I can
