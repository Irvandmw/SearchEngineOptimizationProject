Lyrics:


Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

That's the nice one 
Yeah
Sure
That's the one I like best
