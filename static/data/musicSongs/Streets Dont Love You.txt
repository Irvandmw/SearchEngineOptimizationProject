Lyrics:


I was there and I ain't never
I was hurtin' but I ain't need you
Streets never, mhm
Streets don't love you, they turn they back on you
Streets don't love you, they turn they back on you
They turn they back on you

Streets don't love you, they killed Quado
Streets don't love you, they killed Beasty
Let my niggas come home tomorrow
Don't just let them see me on TV
Let my niggas up out that you know
You don't even know how I be thinkin' that shit crazy
Let my broski know now, my bros, yeah
Let my niggas come home tomorrow
Free V12, yo
I remember when we was like 12 we went through hell, yo
Back when niggas was gettin' they biggies and they Pells took
Bitches used to curve me, used to swerve me, nigga, now look
They ain't never want me now they askin' to get they nails done
I know I smell like dope, they gassin' me tellin' me I smell good
Passin' me the pussy, I passed it to my homie real quick
Audacity to ask me 'bout the bitches that I still fuck
The audacity to ask me 'bout the bitches that I still fuck
Your ass is lookin' fat, them Fashion Nova jeans look real good
I'm glad that I came up 'cause I ain't know where I would end up
The 30 clip is on me but the hoodie cover my extendo
And niggas act so tough
But I just swear they don't wanna start, though
Lemme tell you 'bout this young nigga from the Bronx though
Everybody want his head but nobody had his heart though
Robbin' everybody like he don't believe in karma
Somebody told the feds what he did, they lined him
Told 'em where that nigga lived, yeah, they really lined him
He still sleepin' at his crib like fuck it if they find him
Prices on his head 'cause he hit a opp up
Money on his head got him moving wiser
Hoodie on his head, it woulda been his poncho
Pulled up to the crib he living wit' his moms though
But they don't even care they like hit 'em all up
His eyes turned red and his fists balled up
Voices in his head saying kill them all but
Bullets hittin' glass goin' through the wall though
All he heard was screaming, he feel like his time's up
He ain't had no time to go reach for a glove
He just grabbed the pump, start squeezin' at the door
And then he seen his moms laid out on the floor
He dropped down to his knees he ain't hide to the law
Ain't the type to cry but his mom he really loved
Tears from his eyes dropped beside of the blood
He wishing it won't hurt but he cried because it does
Then, he put his own pump right to his heart
