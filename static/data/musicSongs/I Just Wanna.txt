[Logic - Verse 1]
Somebody let me know right now..
Cause honestly I don't know right now..
And I could be high right now..
But I still feel low somehow..

Do you ever feel, like you don't even know?
Which direction you should go?
If so homie, take it slow,
Pop a bottle with some dro,
Let all of your worries go
-Consume yourself within this flow..

Whether your girl is actin' up,
Or your man was cheating on you,
Or you can't pay your bills
-and you can't take it no mo'
Or somebody done passed away,
Be strong and live another day..

[Logic - Hook]
I said, I just wanna smoke,
I just wanna drink,
There's so much on my mind that I don't even wanna think
[X4]

[Logic - Verse 2]
This is Shakespeare's mind state,
808 and heartbreak,
They feelin' so alone,
Can someone relate to their heart sake?
Used to walk into the room,
And that would make their heart race,
But you ain't seen that person for some time,
And now your heart aches

Now do you even know,
Where you really wanna go?
You been down that street befo',
Maybe you should take it slow,
Think about the life you livin',
But don't think so hard it hurts,
Life is truly a gift,
But at the same it is a curse

Now, you gotta persevere,
Get over any fear,
You let go of the wheel,
But I think now it's time to steer,
So show em that you ready,
And show em that you strong,
But not tonight cause you gon' get your good time on

[Logic - Hook]
I said, I just wanna smoke,
I just wanna drink,
There's so much on my mind that I don't even wanna think
[X4]
