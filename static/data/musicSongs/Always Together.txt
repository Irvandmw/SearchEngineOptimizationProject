Lyrics:


Always together until forever living with dreams that we shared
Two hearts together until forever showing the world that we cared
You won't be lonely I'll love you only I'll live my life just for you
Always together until forever our love will always be true
(Always together until forever) living with dreams that we shared
(Two hearts together until forever) showing the world that we cared
You won't be lonely I'll love you only I'll live my life just for you
Always together until forever our love will always be true
(Always together until forever we'll be true)
