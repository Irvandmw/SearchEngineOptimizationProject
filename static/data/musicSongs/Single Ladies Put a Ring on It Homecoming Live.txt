Lyrics:


(Ladies on the floor) Touch your body
(Ladies on the floor) Touch your body
(Ladies on the, ladies on the) Touch your body
I touch your body, hey!

Give it up for my sister!
Alright now
Everybody put your hands together
Do we have any single ladies in the house tonight?

(Now put your hands up) Sing
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
(Now put your hands up)

Up in the club (Club)
We just broke up (Up)
I'm doing my own little thing
We decided to dip (Dip)
And now you wanna trip (Trip)
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him (Him)
He up on me (Me)
Don't pay him any attention
I cried my tears (Tears)
Yeah, for three good years (Years)
You can't be mad at me

'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(Whoa-oh-oh) 'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it

Now wait
I want y'all to get nice and stinky with me
Where I'm from
We do things nice and stanky
We do things nice and funky
Can y'all repeat after me
You ready?

Say
Hey-ey-ey-ey (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
Hey-ey-ey (Hey-ey-ey)
Hey-ey-ey-ey (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
Hey-ey-ey (Hey-ey-ey)
Hey-ey-ey-ey (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
Hey-ey-ey (Hey-ey-ey)
Hey-ey-ey (Hey-ey-ey)
Hey-ey-ey (Hey-ey-ey)

Now wait
You still ain't stankin' enough for me

Say whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh
Sing whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Put your hands up)
Say whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh (Put a ring on it)
Way whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh (Sing)

If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it (I see you)
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a, a ring on it
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa-oh-oh

I love y'all
