Lyrics:


Strange dear, but true, dear, when I'm close to you, dear
The stars fill the sky, so in love with you am I.
Even without you, my arms fold about you,
You know darling why, so in love with you am I.
In love with the night mysterious, the night when you first were there.
In love with my joy delirious, when I knew that you could care.
So taunt me, and hurt me, deceive me, desert me,
I'm yours till I die, so in love, so in love so in love with you, my love, am I.
