Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Boy what you lookin' for? You know where them cookies are
Yeah, I caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar
Boy what you lookin' for? You know where them cookies are
Yeah, I caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar

Brookie, he rookie, he want the cookie, the cookie
I think you thirsty, you milkin' it, tryna crook me, mistook me
For something sweet, and you're right, but I can't be that tonight
Love had her shavin it clean, but now that pussy on Wookie, boy
Go and handle your part, caught you with hands in that jar
Suckin' that sweet tooth, that canker sore, too long, need to crank it more
And you know you've been savin' for all them bitches who pay you more
He call me Oreo, break it and lick the flavor off, and

Boy what you lookin' for? You know where them cookies are
Yeah, I caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar
Boy what you lookin' for? You know where them cookies are
Yeah, I caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar

Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Yeah, I caught yo ass red-handed in that
Baby

Everybody like, "Notice me, Senpai," y'all niggas all wow with me
Roll with me on the billboard, that's me Senpai y'all niggas ain't cold as me
Hold my hoops, knock it out cold, all these hands tied
I fight for the cause, and tight with ya brawd
Never can afford that, drama come, I ignore that
Fuck talkin', she record that, PokÃ©mon, boy you Snorlax
Swear they been sleepin' on me, I give you Hollywood tease
Breakfast at Tiffany's, ain't got a reason to be seein' me
You seein' all that's to see, baby, yeah yeah yeah

Boy what you lookin' for? You know where them cookies are
Yeah, I caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar
Boy what you lookin' for? You know where them cookies are
Yeah, I caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar

Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar, yuh

Boy I know that you need that chocochip
I got extra taco but you better bring that macho grip
Not gon' fuck around, you had me fooled, thinkin' you not gon' slip
It's my modern life, make me wanna find some Rocko nig
I will dig it up and bring that shit back like some moccasins
You don't want these problems, Coco's promise, I will not forget
I thought love was blind but you lookin', tryna find a trick fine as this
You won't get these sweets again, like violet, you try your bitch

Boy what you lookin' for? You know where them cookies are
Yeah, I caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar
Boy what you lookin' for? You know where them cookies are
Yeah, I caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar

Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Oh ooh oh, and what you lookin' for it?
Caught yo ass red-handed in that cookie jar, yuh
