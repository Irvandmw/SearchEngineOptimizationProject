Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Gone is the romance, that was so divine
It's broken and can not be mended
You must go your way, and I must go mine
But now that our love dreams have ended

What will I do?
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do?

What'll I do?
When I am wondrin' who
Who's kissing you
What'll I do?

What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my little troubles to?

When I'm alone
Alone with only dreams of you
That can't come true
What'll I do?

When I'm all alone
Alone with only dreams of you
Dreams that will never come true
What'll I do?
