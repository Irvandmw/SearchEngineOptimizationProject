Lyrics:


[Chorus]
Face the music you've got hope
Face it face it and you'll chase it far away
Come face the music and make your worry hurry scurry not a care will dare to stay
The drums are drumming you should be humming
Joy is coming coming for to make you gay
So blow the trumpets bang the cymbals when they start to play
Face the music play the music
Every day's a happy day

[JL]
I want to march
Face the music when you've got trouble
Face it face it and you'll chase it far away
Just face the music you'll make your worry hurry scurry not a care will bear to stay
The drums are drumming you should be humming
Joy is coming coming for to make you gay
So blow the trumpet bang the cymbal when they start to play
Face the music face the music
Every day's a happy day

Fall in

[Chorus]
Face the music play the music
Every day's a happy day
