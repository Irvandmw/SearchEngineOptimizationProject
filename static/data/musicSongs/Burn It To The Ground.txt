Lyrics:


Well it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight
I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me

That shit makes me bat shit crazy
We've got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going 'til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground at night

We're screaming like demons, swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties, tequila just hit me

We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced
We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going 'til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground at night

Ticking like a time bomb, drinking 'til the night's gone
Well get your hands off of this glass, last call my ass
Well no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going 'til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground at night

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We're going 'til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground at night
