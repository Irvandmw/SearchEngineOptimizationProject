Lyrics:


(Daytrip took it to 10)
Hey Panini
Don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna' keep me teenie? Ah!

It's a dream, he
Wished it on a genie
I got fans finally
Ain't you wanting them to see me

I, I thought you want this for my life
For my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive
You lied

Just say to me
What you want from me
Just say to me
What you want from me

Baby, let's go, uh
Okay this song right here, reminds me of my ex
I be declining all her calls
And I don't respond to none of her texts
I be like, "Girl, hush your mouth"
"You know I ain't got time for nothing but sex"
"You know I injured my right hand
"So when I get behind I use my left"
She watch the Walker Texas Ranger say I remind her of Nas X
I'm talking Old Town Road, all my hoes down low
They like girls and I like girls, three at a time, sometimes four
And if my bag is not all hunnids
Then there ain't no time that I don't go
I be like...

Say to me
What you want from me
Just say to me
What you want from me

Hey Panini
Don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna' keep me teenie? Ah!

Now, now they need me
Number one on streaming
No, yeah you used to love me so what happened
What's the meaning?

I, I thought you want this for my life
For my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive
You lied

Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need a sit down, don't mean to make demands

But I need you to

Say to me
What you want from me
Just say to me
What you want from me
