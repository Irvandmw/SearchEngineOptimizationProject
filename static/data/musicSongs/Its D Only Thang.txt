Lyrics:


[Chorus:]

Winners, everybody wants to be a winner
Winning is everything uh, nah, winning itâs the only thing

Winning ainât everything, winning itâs d only thang
When youâre living life in the game
Winning ainât everything, winning itâs d only thang
When youâre living life in the game,
Winning ainât everything, winning itâs d only thang
When youâre living life in the game,
Winning ainât everything, winning itâs d only thang
When youâre living life in the game,

[Verse 1:]
I can jump out the jet, I can run, I can swim
I am heavy on the case, I stay in first place
Mud on my shoes, taste blood on my face
Out of town, touch down never out of bounds
I train for the gold, I can go twelve rounds
Steal city baby, we are super bowl bound
Recollect a stack while I check a checker flag
All this winning got me grinning
All this losing got you mad

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
No more Chuck Tâs on my feet, itâs just Adidas
Man they kept it true to the streets
And like he C, Iâm on a 50 game win streak
I canât be beat, I am the real heat
Real king real rings, thatâs what we say
I threw a shirt out and cut out Iâm on my way
PGA car under he may play?
Itâs what amazing happens in the NBA, eh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Eo, we donât take them on the west side
Yeah, I was born to be the best right
Rest and sleep is for the weak
The last shot yâall can go and put it on me
The last swing, the last throw, double U is all a dog know
W-I-N, W-E-S-T OG, Snoop D-O Double G

[Chorus]

Winning ainât everything, winning itâs d only thang
When youâre living life in the game
Winning ainât everything, winning itâs d only thang
When youâre living life in the game,
Winning ainât everything, winning itâs d only thang
When youâre living life in the game,
Winning ainât everything, winning itâs d only thang
When youâre living life in the game,

No matter what game it is, winning it ainât everything, itâs the only thang
And make sure you go hard, blood sweat and tears
Shout out to all the winners out there
Thatâs all I do is win, ya digg? It ainât easy
Congratulations, winner.
