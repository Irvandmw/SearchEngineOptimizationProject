Lyrics:


Back in the day
When I was younger
I wasn't afraid
Of giving my heart to you

Now and again
I get sentimental
But I know it's just a phase
I'm going through

And every time I start to slip
I just remind myself
I need only think of it
I went through so much hell

You say ya wanna get things back
The way they used to be
Can you give me one good reason
Why I should darlin'?

Why should I care?
Why should I care for you?
Why should I care?
Why should I care for you?

Why should I care?
Why should I care for you?
Oh darling why should I care?
Why should I care?

Back in the day
I should've been wiser
But what can I say
I should've been onto you

But I was afraid
That you'd break my heart in two
Fate would have it
That you broke it anyway baby

Every time I close my eyes
I just remind myself
You told about a million lies
You put my heart through hell

And now you wanna get with me
Just for old times sake
Well I am not about to make
That same mistake

Why should I care?
Why should I care for you?
Why should I care?
Why should I care for you?

Why should I care?
Why should I care for you?
Oh, darling, tell me why should I care?
Why should I care?

You see a girl that you gave all your love
I see a girl you took advantage of
You see a girl that you cannot forget
I see a man that I cannot forgive

Tell me why...
Why should I care for you?
Why should I care?
Why should I care for you?

Why should I give a damn baby?
Why should I care for you?
Why should I care, should I care?
Why should I care?

Back in the day
When I was young
I wasn't afraid to love
Back in the day
You were the one
What was I thinking of?

Back in the day
Should've been wiser
Should've been onto you
But I was afraid,
Made a mistake
No one knows

Tell me why should I care for you?
Why should I care?
Why should I care for you?

Why should I care?
Why should I care for you?
Why should I care?
Why should I care?
