Lyrics:


Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans?
I miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's gettin' stronger
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss covered vines, the tall sugar pines
Where mockin' birds used to sing
And I'd like to see the lazy Mississippi
Hurryin' into spring

The Mardi Gras, the memories
Of Creole's tunes that fills the air
I dream of old [unverified] in June
And soon I'm wishin' that I were there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where I left my heart?
And there's something more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans
