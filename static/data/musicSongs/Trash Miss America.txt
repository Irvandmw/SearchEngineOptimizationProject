Lyrics:


Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?

I'll do my hair up all high and wide, wild flowers tied
Green swimming pool pink flamingos, high christmas lights
Blue bedspread and silver tinsel, my hearts delight

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?

Do you like my fake nails daddy?
Black palmtree pink tiger-stripes
Used to go to the kamfreena
Will you buy me a slice of cherry pie?
We didn't know much, just worked at night
Sweet trailer light

1,2..
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?

He said: Lana Rey, will you serve me lemonade?
And I said: yes, Bill, I will, it's the day of the parade
And you look even more handsome than you did
On the day that I left you
How do you spend your nights, honey?
Still watchin' TV? I long to be in your arms, honey
Come back to me
Please

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?

All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good, you know?

Come on now if you want to
If you want to if you want to
It's been a long time

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?
