Lyrics:


Iâll say goodbye to all that old friends
Just for you, just for you
If we can be together, just we two

Iâll stay at home all week and weekends
If youâll be there with me
Our lust will be a drift, you just wait and see

Iâll forget the old days
When running around was fun
Through the years and always
Youâll be the only one

Iâll save my love and my affection
Just for you, Iâll be true
As long as I may live, Iâll live just for you
