Lyrics:


I've been as far as you can go, I've learned a lot and now I know, you're never gonna get me
on the floor again, I'm prepared to take you to the end, never gonna play your games again
bring your whole team and all your friends, but I hope you're listenin. 

Haunt me if you want me, but I'll warn you, If you ever step to me..

I sometimes wish that I could fly, hold me tight in your arms tonight, I'm sick of livin
inside a lie, Alright I can't count the time I've tried, stand alone just to lift you high,
you're my answer to the question why 

I'm sick of letting you control me and all the places I go, I'm never givin in to you again,
take another look at me and tell me what you see, all of these kats tryin to get under my skin
but they can't step over me. You try to control me but ya can't hold me, you don't own me, if
you ever step to me

I sometimes wish that I could fly, hold me tight in your arms tonight, I'm sick of livin
inside a lie, Alright I can't count the time I've tried, stand alone just to lift you high,
you're my answer to the question why

I know it's not me , take a look inside me, I'm sick of these ways, so sick of these games,
couldn't see it 'til I multiplied you, call me a freak, but I don't want to hear the words you
speak, I'm takin control, just letting you know, that I won't get sucked in by you

I sometimes wish that I could fly, hold me tight in your arms tonight, I'm sick of livin
inside a lie, Alright I can't count the time I've tried, stand alone just to lift you high,
you're my answer to the question why

Haunt me if you want me, but I'll warn you, If you ever step to me again, you try to control
me, but ya can't hold me, you don't own me, if you ever step to me.
