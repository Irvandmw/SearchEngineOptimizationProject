Lyrics:


Why you wanna tell me how to life my life?
And who are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Momma can you help me try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy live to die that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life just slaving away

Ooh, if there's one thing I could give you
To get you through the night
Ooh, a little something to hang onto
To make you feel alive
Brighter than a diamond, sharper than a knife
Standing on the ledge, it might save your live
If there's one thing I could say
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Living in a broken home of hopes and dreams
Take a look around you nothing's what it seems
Who are you to tell me where a flower grows?
Who are you to tell me that a child don't know?
Innocence has died out on a dead end street
Looking for forgiveness, down on his knees

Ooh, if there's one thing I could give you
To get you through the night
Ooh, a little something to hang onto
To make you feel alive
Brighter than a diamond, sharper than a knife
Standing on the ledge, it might save your live
If there's one thing I could say
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Ooh, if there's one thing I could give you
To get you through the night
Ooh, a little something to hang onto
To make you feel alive

Ooh, if there's one thing I could give you
To get you through the night
Ooh, a little something to hang onto
To make you feel alive
Brighter than a diamond, sharper than a knife
Standing on the ledge, it might save your live
If there's one thing I could say
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
