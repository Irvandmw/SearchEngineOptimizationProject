Lyrics:


Hey, hey, hey
If I can only make you see 
That you were only meant for me 
Our love will be free
And I'll be your destiny 
Your destiny, your destiny

If I can make you understand 
Treat me right and love me 
Then I will be your man 
Your one and only man 

These are the words that I have to say 
Live by them each and every day 
And as the time pass I know our love will last
Our love will last, our love will last 

Take me blue and understand them 
Live by them and love me 
Then I will be your man 
Your one and only man 

These are the words that I have to say 
Just live by them each and every day 
And as the time pass I know our love will last
Our love will last, our love will last 

Take me blue and understand
Live by them and love me 
Honey I will be your man 
Your one and only man 
Your sweet lovin' man
I will be your man 

(Your one and only man)
(Your one and only man)
(Your one and only man)
(I will be your man).
