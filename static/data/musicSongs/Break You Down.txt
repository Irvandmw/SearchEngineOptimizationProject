Lyrics:


[Intro]
Break you down
Break you down

[Verse]
In you âcause your life
And just feel aside all the things you like
Baby âcause weâre gonna do it tonight
Weâre gonna do it tonight
So tell me all the lies
Gotta get it right
On the candle light
Girl, Iâm gonna do it tonight
Weâre gonna do this all night

[Bridge]
You gotta get your body ready when you get off in the step
âCause Iâmma give it to you like you never ever had it before
Give it to you til you canât take it no more, take it no more

[Chorus]
Tell me where you want me
Baby, tell me where you want me
Girl itâs your body Iâm craving, Iâm needing you baby
I donât wanna wait, I wanted you to tell me
âCause baby and I know you like it
So donât you even try to fight it

[Interlude x3]
Girl I break you down
Girl I girl I break you down
Girl I break you down
Girl I girl I break you down

[Verse]
Iâm gonna put your legs behind my head
I knew my down, you ainât gotta feel no less
âCause we gotta do it tonight, do it tonight

[Interlude]
I want your body on my body, body on my body girl
Body on my body, body on my body girl
Do it tonight, do it tonight

[Bridge]
You gotta get your body ready when you get off in the step
âCause Iâmma give it to you like you never ever had it before
Give it to you til you canât take it no more, take it no more

[Chorus]
Tell me where you want me
Baby, tell me where you want me
Girl itâs your body Iâm craving, Iâm needing you baby
I donât wanna wait, I wanted you to tell me
âCause baby and I know you like it
So donât you even try to fight it

[Interlude x3]
Girl I break you down
Girl I girl I break you down
Girl I break you down
Girl I girl I break you down
