Song Name: Are You Growing Tired of My Love?
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You never seen, seen to have
The time to listen to what I say
How can I know just
What goes in your mind?
If you always walk away

So, what's the good of trying?
What's the good of trying?
Hanging around bagging for you love
When it seems there's someone
Else in your dreams and I can't be
Sure of you anymore

Are you going tired of my love?
Have you had too much of my love?
Are you going tired of my love?
Where is the love you once gave me?

And when we meet
(And when we ever meet)
Things are not the same now
You always carry away
And all the plans that once
You used to share with me
Are ignored now and I'm bored now

I guess this is but still I go on for me
'Cause you never couldn't get into it
Oh, can you see? You should be
Honest with me and I've got to find
What is in your mind

Are you going tired of my love?
Have you had too much of my love?
Are you going tired of my love?
Where is the love you once gve me?

Are you going tired of my love?
Have you had too much of my love?
Are you going tired of my love?
Where is the love you once gave me?

Tired of my love?
Where is the love you once gave me?

Are you going tired of my love?
Have you?
