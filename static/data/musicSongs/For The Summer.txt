Lyrics:


God damn, here we go again
She fallin' in love and I'm just tryna be her friend
Know she got a man, hope she understand
That after August thirty-first, won't hear from me again
'Cause I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer, hey

I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm a dog, I fuck who I wanna
I'm smoking on some real good marijuana
I bump into your bitch, then she's a goner
And she fucking with me 'cause I'm the man
And I don't care about her, I keep it player 'bout her
I fuck her real good, I pull her hair up out her
You blow her phone up, that's why it stay on silent
I be like baby let me fuck you on the camera
Snapchat, throw that ass back
And she a good freak, she let me have that
We smoking good weed, you need to pass that
Now we high and we just lying on the bed
Thought I was tired but she fire with the head
Take her in public, show her off like I'm her man
Wait till the fall and then go holler at her friend

'Cause I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer, hey

I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you front your mama
I'm just tryna fuck you, fuck your brother
He can run up on me if he wanna, hey
And I'm just tryna fuck you front your sister
Should call her on the FaceTime while I hit it
And she gon' eat that dick like it's for dinner
I fucked around and ate her, taste like Skittles, ayy
When we go out I act like I'm her nigga
Her friend keep flirting with me, I'ma hit her
I make her feel amazing when I'm with her
But you a ho about it, so what you know about it?

God damn, here we go again
She fallin' in love and I'm just tryna be her friend
Know she got a man, hope she understand
That after August 31st won't hear from me again
'Cause I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer, hey
'Cause I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer, hey
'Cause I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer
I'm just tryna fuck you for the summer, hey
