Lyrics:


They call me the breeze, I keep blowing down the road
They call me the breeze, I keep blowing down the road
I ain't got me nobody, I ain't carrying me no load

Ain't no change in the weather, ain't no change in me
Ain't no change in the weather, ain't no change in me
I ain't hidin' from nobody, ain't nobody hidin' from me

I got that green light, babe, I got to keep moving on
I got that green light, babe, I got to keep moving on
I might go out to California, might go down to Georgia, might stay home
