Lyrics:


Iâm here now nigger yeah, youâve been waiting on me to bust on this beat.
So let me go ahead and do my thing.

Iâve got one all ready. 
You can smoke on the jeezy
Imma smoke on the bleezy
Nigger take it easy
Big Snoop heezy all-in the place let the beat go bang and turnup the bass
Imma give it to you live and direct on stage 
cuz imma different nigger when I hit that stage
My name is Snoop Dogg and you can turn the page
Kick that shit like a 12-gage

Motherfucker get close to the shit that I bang like
Snoop Dogg is on the microphone and I came like
This is that good shit straight from my brain like
Nigger gettinâ close try to pitch in frame like

Donât get close cuz I represent the coast
Burn a nigger like a breakfast toast
Yes indeed I procceed 
And Iâm in Amsterdam blowing weed
With my niggers

We gettinâ money, money, money, money, money, money, money
We gettinâ money, money, money, money, money, money, money

Let me break it down like this

See, see to get money is a small thing for me
To get money is a big thing for you
But you donât get it like I get it cuz your name ainât Snoop
And you donât roll around in a 78â coupe

With the windows lay that
Laidback
With a bad bitch holding on my
Litt that
Yeah I'm bout to do that
And rear that
And clear that
And do it to you just like did that 

Boom bam
Cuz I go like that 
I make a motherfucker wanna flow like that
I take it back to the store like that
Bust your bitch and make her wanna hold like that
Cuz Iâm all about cheese
Snoop Dogg D O dubble G
I am the one and only S N dubble O P D O dubble G why from the LBC

And I get money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money

Let me break it down for you one time

Green is for the money
Green is for the book
Green is for the shit Iâve been doing in the club
Green is for the people that been down with me
And green is for the motherfucking DPG

We get it all the time
Never ever faking the font
And green is for the shit Iâve been put in my blunt
And green is for the motherfucker standing on the side ones Snoop gets a touchdown 
And screamout East-side

money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
