Lyrics:


I've come to feel that you're a blessing in disguise,
find a way of making sure.
Is what you show to me the devil in your eyes,
are you the killer or the cure.

I could be the fire you start
at just the mention of your name.
I rise and I rise up to heaven my love,
and let you shoot me down in flames
you don't take me serious,
too insane to see you're just too good to be true,
and I don't sympathise with those
who crawl home to you.

Your head is on the line, you find no other love
and I would go through hell for you,
tell me will you ever let me in.
Tell me, will you ever let me in?

Maybe the trick is to be
Taken by surprise
And lady be wise, beware
The way to make you make that
Final sacrifice
The dream is real for those who dare.

I will redefine your life
We remember till we die
When love is in motion who needs
More than this
And soon we know what passion is
All is fair in love and war
It's what I'm fighting for, but you're just too good
to be true,
and I don't sympathise with those
who crawl home to you.

Your head is on the line, you find no other love
and I would go through hell for you,
tell me will you ever let me in.
Tell me, will you ever let me in?

I will be the fire you start
at just the mention of your name.
All is fair in love and war,
you know what I'm fighting for,
love has shot me serious,
right between the eyes,
you're just too good
to be true,
and I don't sympathise with those
who crawl home to you.

Your head is on the line, you find no other love
and I would go through hell for you,
tell me will you ever let me in.
Tell me, will you ever let me in?

Tell me will you ever let me in
Tell me will you ever let me ...
