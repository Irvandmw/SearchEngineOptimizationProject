Lyrics:


The time was twenty past
Our meeting was delayed
I watched you move
Over Edinburgh concrete
I hid behind the wall
And as you approached
I tried to guess
At what you were thinking
Then memory, took me away
Two miles from here
And three decades ago
Then all at once, so soon
You were inside the room
And that was Tuesday afternoon

This love is old and new
This love is happening now
This love is mine
And I give it you gladly
If you don't want it, say
I'll take it away
And put it back in the place
Where I found it
And every now and then
I'll take it out again
Turn it in my hands
And look upon its madness
Then lead it from the room
And show it to the moon
And remember Tuesday afternoon

I remember Tuesday afternoon
I recall the sweet scent of your skin
And if I try hard I begin
Almost to draw a trace
Of your glistening lips upon my face
I never regret you
But sometimes I forget you
Like when I'm tired
And I make bad decisions
But you come back to me
Your lovely melody
Sings to my soul
And lifts me to heaven
And as I'm rising up
A yellow buttercup
Illuminates your chin
And causes gentle laughter
Yours is the song I croon
I know I'll see you soon
I love you, Tuesday afternoon
