Lyrics:


I know I said some things I didn't mean to last night
Another argument over something so light
You said that you would leave, with a tear in your eyes
And I so selfishly fell asleep to your cries

I woke up to your photograph
Reminded me of all the silly things we did that made us laugh
Wishing we were right back where we fell in love without a care
I let you get away
Away from me
I'm broken and afraid
I'm on my knees

You've been away for days, I wonder where could you be
I can't imagine life without you and me
Your photos fading fast from my memory
Can you forget the past and coming home to me?

I cry each time I fall to sleep
I wake up nights and call your name out loud and hope that you're hearing me
And somewhere in the darkest nights I wish that I could hold you tight
I let you get away
Away from me
I'm broken and afraid
I'm on my knees

Baby come to me, baby can't you see
Got a deep burning love that's inside
I let you get away
Away from me
