Lyrics:


Please start dirty
Itâs 7:30
Loss of mind and
Cat alertly
My best, your rest
Send your call
And then I nest

Perversity in features
Adversity that teaches
Some call love more
Soon Iâll call the rhythm song

Itâs over
Itâs over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
Itâs over
Itâs over now
I dare not get a look

Be yourself
Some let her call
Never fall
See yourself
Sit alone and wait
To my own call

Go ballistic
Anarchistic
Smack my mouth and
Then you kissed it
So long, my gun
Simple run and
Letter bum

Things are looking good on paper
Once when I was in your favor
This kiss from a mess
Send my girl riddle less

Itâs over
Itâs over now
So long to riddle songs
Itâs over
Itâs over now
I dare not read a song

See yourself
Sad, alone and wait
To my own brawl
Free yourself
Thereâs an only count
This stands for all of them

Just play at any tempo
Going mad and going mental
All balm, said no
Just to let him put it wrong

Itâs over
Itâs over now
It's time to get along
Itâs over
Itâs over now
Itâs over
Itâs over now
