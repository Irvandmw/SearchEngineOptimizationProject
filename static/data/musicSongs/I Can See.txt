Lyrics:


I'm so close I can taste it
The man on the moon keep playing
Practical jokes, planet of mirrors and smoke
That I fade away in
You be complaining
And I can't explain it
I guess, nothing compare to the feeling of feeling amazing
Now I'm switching location
'Cause Heaven too far when you live a basement
I'm looking for balance, I'm in an oasis

Well, I need somebody to save me
Before I drive myself crazy
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see

Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep going until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hitting the ground, I'm hitting the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop so hold on, boy
That's just the way it goes, your God don't wait for no one
And when that's all your know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go but look at where you came from

And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see
