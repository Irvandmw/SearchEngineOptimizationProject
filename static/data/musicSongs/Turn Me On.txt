Lyrics:


I'm a boy, she's a girl
We're gonna do this around the world
Catch her eye and count to five
And remember everybody dies, you know

I'm not her friend no, not second best
I'll send her home unless they're both in it together
And they're both on each other
That's my kinda party
That's my kinda party

'Cause I'm a boy, she's a girl
We're all doing this around the world
Around the world
Around the world
Around the world

So, why get complicated?
You know you wanna turn me on
Why get complicated?
You know you wanna turn me on

Underwater, with someone's daughter
Gonna make you a dirty woman
And when we're both in it together
And we're both on each other

That's my kinda party
That's my kinda party
I'm a boy, she's a girl
We're all doing this around the world
Around the world
Around the world
Around the world

So, why get complicated?
You know you wanna turn me on
Why get complicated
You know you wanna turn me on

Why get complicated?
You know you wanna turn me on
Why get complicated?
You know you wanna turn me on
Why get complicated?
You know you wanna turn me on
Why get complicated?
You know you wanna turn me on

I'm a boy she's a girl
We're all doing this around the world
Around the world
Around the world
Around the world
