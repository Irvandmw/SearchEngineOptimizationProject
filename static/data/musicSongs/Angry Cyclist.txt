Lyrics:


For me I feel this era has been kissed, kissed. Mmmm...
By the aura of an angry cyclist, list. Mmmm...
Black loathing so sincere,
Red anger born of fear,
There's nothing half as queer as today.

I take a few steps back to gain perspective, perspective. Mmmm...
And kid myself that I can be objective, objective. Mmmm...

Watch bigotry advance,
Give ignorance a chance,
With fascists we will dance by and by.

Old prejudice hasn't gone.
New energy drives it on.

Again I feel this era has been kissed, kissed. Mmmm...
By the aura of an angry cyclist, list. Mmmm...
Black loathing so sincere,
Red anger born of fear,
There's nothing half as queer as today.

Watch bigotry advance,
Give ignorance a chance,
With fascists we'll now dance, my oh my.
