Lyrics:


I was born an only son
Didn't take to the rules, like a normal child
Prisoner of things I've done
It's the price you pay livin' fast and wild
I've spent too many nights
Lookin' over my shoulder
And the ways of the world make a heart
Grow colder
Got nowhere left to hide
The fight in me has died
So I must wait for the sunrise
Friend to fear and loaded gun

Live life like the owner of a heart of stone
No one touches, touch no one
But the road gets weary when you're all alone
I've spent too many nights
Lookin' over my shoulder
And the ways of the world make a heart
Grow colder
Got nowhere left to hide
The fight in me has died
So I must wait for the sunrise
Too much done to undo
No one I can run to
I need one more chance to live my life again
I've spent too many nights lookin'
Over
My shoulder
And the ways of the world make a heart
Grow colder
Got nowhere left to hide
The fight in me has died
So I must wait for the sunrise
