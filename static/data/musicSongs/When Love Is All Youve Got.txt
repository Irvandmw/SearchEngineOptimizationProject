Lyrics:


Saw a man out on the street today, his whole life in a box
Someone must've loved him once, right now, he just feels lost
I don't know where he's headed, can't tell where he's been
God, I wish that I could say to him, you can start your life again

If you can find somebody
You can love more than you
You gotta hold on, hang on, whatever you do
And when it feels like you've got nothing
And your world is all but stopped
You still have everything, when love is all you've got

A family praying beneath a bridge, I don't know how they do it
Their shoes and clothes were all but gone, but their faith will get them through it
You know there's somethin' special, about a mother and a father
Who can teach their kids to love, when others might not bother

So when you find somebody
You can love more than you
When the rain stops raining and the sun shines through
And when it feels like you've got nothing
And your world is all but stopped
You'll still have everything, when love is all you've got

Maybe there's a miracle, your name's been written on
Maybe it's been standing right beside you all along

So when you find somebody (find somebody)
You can love more than you (more than you)
You gotta hold on, (hold on) hang on, (hang on) whatever you do
And when it feels like you've got nothing
And your world is all but stopped
You still have everything
You still have everything 
When love is all you've got
