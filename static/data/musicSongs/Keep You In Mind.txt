Lyrics:


[Chris Brown & Bryson Tiller:]
I like your bad attitude
Pull up on me, baby, with everything off
Tonight it's all about you (oh, yeah)
What I want, baby, all night
Your sex game strong
Girl, I been too excited
Going 'bout it all wrong
Yeah, yeah
I need to step it up, yeah, and turn them lights off
Bring your body here to me. You know I like learning
We gon' break the bed, we gon' break the bed
You gon' get this head, girl
Just spread your legs

[Chris Brown:]
I know you like it, and, girl, I love your perfume
Girl, it's all about you, girl. Let's light this fire up
If it's room for two, baby
Can I keep you mind
Baby, tell me, can I, can I
Baby, tell me, oh, yeah, yeah
Can I keep you in mind (in my mind)?

[Bryson Tiller:]
You got em' wasting your time, wasting your time
What must I do to make you mine?
But you ain't even gotta say it, nah, nah
Tell me I'm wasting my time
Even though we ain't together whenever they ask me
I say that you're mine
But you've been out here saying different
So why should I say you're mine?
Girl, you must've said "No", must've said "Oh, no".
But you don't feel the same, oh, no
(no, no)

[Chris Brown:]
I know you like it, and, girl, I love your perfume
Girl, it's all about you, girl. Let's light this fire up
If it's room for two, baby
Can I keep you mind
Baby, tell me, can I, can I
Baby, tell me, oh, yeah, yeah
Can I keep you in mind (in my mind)?
Can I keep you in mind?
Baby, tell me, can I, can I
Baby, tell me, oh, yeah yeah
Keep you in mind (in my mind)?
