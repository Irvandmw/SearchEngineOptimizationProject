Damn DJ Plugg, you just killed this

[Offset:]
I get the dope and I make it do magic (dope)
I fucked the thot and she straight out of magic (thot)
You work with the fed boy, I hear all that static
I used to sleep on the pissy ass mattress
Now I sleep on a bad bitch and she plastic (bad)
Throw me the brick and you know I'ma catch it (hey)
Dick on extend, nigga go in a casket (brrp)
Poppin' that shit, he been poppin' that shit (hold up)
I just paid a lil' 40 to go and go get it (pop it, pop it, pop it)
They diggin' that shit, how I'm livin' and shit
I've been gettin' money like I'm [?]
You ain't take nothin' but a quarter, nigga (huh?)
We get the bricks over borders, nigga (borders)
I took a bitch to the mansion
I kicked the bitch out because she tried to record a nigga (yah)

[Hoodrich Pablo Juan:]
I got more water than Florida, nigga
Diamonds dancing, doing jumping jacks
I flip it, double back, make it do acrobats
[?] every letter in the alphabet
Bust down the Rollie, can't see where the time's at
Cut with the sack like I should have played lineback
Drunk me a 4 in the 20, that Pineapp'
[?] with my neck, I think I hear a [?]
Serving the junkies I grew up a [?]
Smoking moonrocks, I'm going to NASA
Bands on me like I'm having a battle
[?] the cookie, it don't even matter
Get to poppin' pills, you would think I have cancer
In the foreign gettin' road head from a dancer
I'm in designer made from a [?]
I come in this bitch lit like a candle

[Quavo:]
Too many bricks, gotta sort 'em (bricks)
Nigga, come and place your order (brrp)
Look at my wrist, it's water (water)
Your favorite top model a snorter (wooh)
Cost on my ears, a quarter (ears)
Fuck how you feel, abort 'em (fuck it)
I'm in the field, Portis (field)
Look at the shell, tortoise (rah)
Give me the bail, ornament (bail)
Name a lil' bitch I ain't goin' to get (bitch)
Police tryna [?] like the Hornets [?]
Send me ten bricks and have fun with it (ten)
If it ain't clean, I don't want it (clean)
Drop me a ten for appointments (ten)
You get a mule or a donkey (mule)
Just give me the extras, I want it (wooh)
I'm with your broad and all, I'm taking her phone, denying your calls (brr)
I'm with my dogs and all, we pulling up on you and tie-dyeing the walls (whoa)
I got the 9, the uzi, the big bazooka, it's just for a cause (wooh)
Look at my wrist, the Patek, the 1970 disco ball (ice)
