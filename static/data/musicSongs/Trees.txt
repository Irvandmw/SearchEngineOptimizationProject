Lyrics:


I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Silent in the trees.
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly.

I can feel your breath.
I can feel my death.
I want to know you.
I want to see.
I want to say hello.

Hello. Hello-oh-o. Hello.

Na na, na na na nah na na. [4x]

I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Silent in the trees.
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly.

I can feel your breath.
I can feel my death.
I want to know you.
I want to see.
I want to say hello.

Na na, na na na nah na na. [2x]
Hello, hello.
Na na, na na na nah na na. [2x]
Hello, hello.

Hello, hello. [2x]
