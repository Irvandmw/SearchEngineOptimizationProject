Lyrics:


Old soul, your wounds they show
I know, you have never felt so low
But hold on, head up, be strong
Oh, hold on
Hold on until you hear them come
Here they come oh

Take an angel by the wings
Beg her now for anything
Beg her now for one more day
Take an angel by the wings
Time to tell her everything
Ask her for the strength to stay

Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh [repeat]

You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything
You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything

You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything
You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything

Look up, call to the sky, oh
Look up, and donât ask why
Oh
Just take an angel by the wings
Beg her now for anything
Beg her now for one more day
Take an angel by the wings
Time to tell her everything
Ask her for the strength to stay

Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oooooooh [repeat]

You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything
You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything

You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything
You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything

You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything
You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything

You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything
You can, you can
Do anything, anything
You can, do anything
