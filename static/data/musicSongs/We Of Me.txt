Song Name: We Of Me
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


My squeezed heart divides
Into two wide wings
The world is
A sudden place
If you don't
Belong to anything

Noah may have got it wrong
There's one more
That could belong

This must be the
Irony of Fate
That I and the world
Are always separate

All other people
Have a we to claim
Except for me
And my own name

I belong to be
With the two of you
And we make three
As a family
That is why
You're the we of me
We of me

I belong to be
With the two of you
And we make three
As a family
That is why
You're the we of me
We of me

Noah's ark admitted, only two by two
We know this isn't always true
Noah may have got it wrong
There's one more that could belong

I belong to be
With the two of you
We make three
As a family
That is why
You are the we of me
The we of me

That is why
You are the we of me
The we of me

That is why
You are the we of me
The we of me
