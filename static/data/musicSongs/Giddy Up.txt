Lyrics:


Gotta giddy up...
Gotta giddy up...
'N Sync - giddy up... like this
Gotta giddy up..
C'mon...just drop the verse
Gotta giddy up... 
Tried to get a hold of you last night
Called you on the phone
Thinkin' to myself something ain't right
Girl were you alone? 

Letting little things come between us
All we do is fuss
When all I wanna do is show you love 

So I say, Hold up!
I'm tired of all these lies...yeah, yeah
Hold up!
And if you wanna make things right
That's right
Hold up!
I'm tired of all these lies
Hold up!
Cause if you wanna make things right, you got to.. 

Giddy up, Giddy up, Giddy up now (giddy up, giddy up)
I Gotta giddy up
Giddy up, Giddy up, Giddy up now (giddy up, giddy up)
Gotta giddy up
Giddy up, Giddy up, Giddy up now (giddy up, giddy up)
I gotta giddy up, giddy up 
Giddy up, Giddy up, Giddy up now (giddy up, giddy up)
Gotta giddy up 

Remembering the way we used to be
Everything was cool
And now you've gone and done all this to me babe (to me]
