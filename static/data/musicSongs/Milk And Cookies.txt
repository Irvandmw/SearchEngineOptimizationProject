Lyrics:


1, 2,
Melatonin is coming for you
3, 4,
Baby, won't you lock the door?
5, 6,
I'm done with this
7, 8,
It's getting late,
So close your eyes, sleep for days

Hush, little baby,
Drink your spoiled milk
I'm fucking crazy,
Need my prescription filled

Do you like my cookies?
They're made just for you
A little bit of sugar,
But lots of poison, too

Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh-ooh, honey, do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end

9, 10,
Never want to see you again
11, 12,
I pull off black so well
Shit behind the curtain
That I'm sick of sugarcoatin'
Next time you're alone,
Think twice when you grab the phone

Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh-ooh, honey, do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end

Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh-ooh, honey, do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
