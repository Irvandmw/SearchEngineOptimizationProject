Lyrics:


Last week I saw you out and I knew we would be a match in heaven
Just the coolest kind of team
I. I know there ainât now way that we wonât
cause we wonât stop till we go
go the distance weâre a distance
baby I believe it
I still believe it
and you know wonât be defeated
in my heart I believe it yeah
you and me are gonna win it

baby Iâm gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
weâre gonna show this town what I know weâre about
shoot it run it whatâs it called?
everybody loves it, football.
shoot it run it whatâs it called?
everybody loves it, football.

Iâve got the feeling that this year could be the one
weâre gonna tear it up and burn out every one
I I know there ainât now way that we wonât
cause we wonât stop till we go
go the distance weâre a distance
baby I believe it
I still believe it
and you know wonât be defeated
in my heart I believe it yeah
you and me are gonna win it

baby Iâm gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
weâre gonna show this town what I know weâre about
(shoot it run it whatâs it called?
everybody loves it, football. [x4])

new york, london, paris, munich
everybody talk about pop music

I still believe it
and you know wonât be defeated
in my heart I believe it yeah
you and me are gonna win it
baby Iâm gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
weâre gonna show this town what I know weâre about [x2]
