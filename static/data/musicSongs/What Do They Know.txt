Lyrics:


[Bryan:]
All they know
Is when we fight
They never see us in the loving times
What do they know
They don't know
A thing

[Mark:]
And they don't know
How laughter flies
Only the stories 
Most of which are lies
What do they know
They don't know
A thing

[Shane:]
How can you understand
A love so strong
When you never shared that with someone
And when all the lies are dead and gone
We'll still be here
We'll prove them wrong

[Mark:]
Cause they don't feel 
Your touch at night
The way your head falls in the morning light 
What do they know
They don't know 
A thing

[Bryan:]
How can you understand
A love so strong
When you never shared that with someone
And when all the lies are dead and gone
We'll still be here
We'll prove them wrong

[Shane:]
Cause all they know is how to criticize
They'll never take a chance in their own lives
What do they know
They dont know 
A thing
And all I know
Is they don't know a thing
