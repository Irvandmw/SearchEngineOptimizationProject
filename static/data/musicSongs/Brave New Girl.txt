Lyrics:


Sheâs gonna pack her bags
Sheâs gonna find her way
Sheâs gonna get right out of this
She donât want New York
She donât want L.A.
Sheâs gonna find that special kiss
She donât want no sleep
She donât want no high
Oh, like peaches ânâ cream
Sheâs gonna wish on stars and touch the sky
Ah, you know what I mean

She wants a good time
No need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet
Wonât take a back seat
Thereâs a brave new girl
And sheâs cominâ out tonight

Sheâs gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.âs changed
She donât wanna behave
Ainât it good to be a brave girl tonight

Tonight, itâs alright
A brave girl tonight

So she met this man 
He was kinda rough
He said, girl, whatcha lookinâ for
She said, I donât know
I go with the flow
He said, letâs get on the floor
He said, you look real cute with your low ride jeans
And your pink little baby tee
Letâs get a room, girl
Come and ride with me

She wants a good time
No need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet
Wonât take a back seat
Thereâs a brave new girl
And sheâs comin' out tonight

Sheâs gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.âs changed 
She donât wanna behave
Ainât it good to be a brave girl tonight

Tonight, itâs alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, itâs alright
A brave girl tonight

[Digital:] I must keep on moving
Who knew she could feel so alive

Sheâs gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.âs changed
She donât wanna behave
Ainât it good to be a brave girl tonight
Tonight itâs alright
A brave girl tonight

Tonight, itâs alright
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight
