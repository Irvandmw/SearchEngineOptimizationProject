Lyrics:


Can I do something else off my new album please?
Can I sing something else off my new album?

This next song
This next song is my favorite song to sing
About the love of your life
And how I first said hello
Talking about meeting the man of your dreams for the first time
It's called Hello
Let me sing it to you

I love the way you walk into the room
Body shining lighting up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what to say
And the way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

You had me at hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
'Cause you had me at hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
'Cause it was many years ago
Baby when you
Stole my cool
'Cause you had me at hello
Hello
Hello

I get so excited when you travel with me
Baby, while I'm on my grind
Never would I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time
Keep me humble out of this hype
'Cause you know there's more to life
If I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Wanna feel you wanna be near you
You're the air that I breathe to survive
I wanna know you, wanna show you
That without you my sun doesn't shine

You don't have to try so for me to love you
Boy, without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so for me to love you

'Cause you had me at hello
Hello
Hello
'Cause you had me at hello
Hello
Hello
Baby, it was many years ago
When you
Stole my cool
Baby you had me at hello
Hello
Hello

Everybody say hello to Nicki on the drums
Say hello to Nicki on the drums
Say hello to Nicki on the drums
Play, play, play
Nicki, Nicki, play, play, play

Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello (hello)
Hello, hello
Hello
