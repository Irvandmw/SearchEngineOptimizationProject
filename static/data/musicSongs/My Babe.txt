Lyrics:


Well, my babe, don't stand no kissin', my babe
Oh yeah, she don't stand no kissin', my babe
Well, my baby don't stand no kissin'
'Cept when I'm the one she's kissin'
My babe, true little baby, my babe

Oh, my babe I know she love me, my babe
Oh yeah, I know she love me, my babe
Well, my babe I know she love me
She don't do nothin' but kiss and hug me
My babe, true little baby, my babe

Woe, babe

Yeah, my baby don't stand no foolin', my babe
Oh yeah, she don't stand no foolin', my baby
Well, my baby don't stand no foolin'
When she's around she's so darn coolin'
My babe, true little baby, my babe

Hey, baby

Well, my baby don't stand no foolin', my babe
Oh yeah, she don't stand no foolin', my baby
Oh yeah, she don't stand no foolin'
When she's around she's so darn coolin'
My babe, true little baby, my babe

Well my babe, true little baby, my babe
Well my babe, true little baby, my babe
