Lyrics:


It's amazing
When this song comes on
I just lose control
Got to sing along
It takes over me
Like a hurricane
It's got me dancing loud
I'm 'bout to go insane

I feel the raindrops on my head
But that don't mean I'm going to bed no no
It's got me feeling so alive tonight

And I know I'm not the only one who dances in the rain
I hear it like the thunder
Music in my brain
It's got me going dancing in the moonlight, tonight, again, again
I'm not the only one who dances is the rain
The only one who dances in the rain

No I'm not alone
I know you feel it too
Even if it pours
The song takes over you
So let the thunder roll
Let all the rain fall
We'll just keep on dancing to the same song

I feel the raindrops on my head
But that don't mean I'm going to bed no no
It's got me feeling so alive tonight

And I know I'm not the only one who dances in the rain
I hear it like the thunder
Music in my brain
It's got me going dancing in the moonlight, tonight, again, again
I'm not the only one who dances in the rain
I hear it like the thunder
Music in my brain
It's got me going dancing in the moonlight, tonight, again, again

So let the speakers blow
It's time to lose control
I'll give it all I got
'Cause either way I know
I'm not alone

I'm not the only one who dances in the rain
I hear it like the thunder
Music in my brain
It's got me going dancing in the moonlight, tonight, again, again
Oh I'm not the only one who dances in the rain
I hear it like the thunder
Music in my brain
It's got me going dancing in the moonlight, tonight, again, again again, again
I'm not the only one who dances in the rain
I hear it like the thunder
Music in my brain
It's got me going dancing in the moonlight, tonight, again, again
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
