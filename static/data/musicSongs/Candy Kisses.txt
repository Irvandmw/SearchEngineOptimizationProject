Lyrics:


(Candy kisses wrapped in paper)

Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than any of mine
Candy kisses wrapped in paper you'd rather have 'em any old time

You don't mean it when you whisper those sweet love words in my ear
Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than mine do dear

(Oh candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than any of mine
Candy kisses wrapped in paper)

Once my heart was filled with gladness now there's sadness only tears
Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than mine do dear
Mean more to you than mine do dear
(Candy kisses)
