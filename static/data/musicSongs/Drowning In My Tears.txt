Lyrics:


I've cried so much over you and I'm drowning in my tears
Oh it's no wonder I'm going under drowning in my tears
You hurt me so in many ways and I spent so many years
Walking and thinking so now I'm a sinking drowning in my tears
I keep on crying for help but you turned your back on me
I'm over my head in misery
I guess I'll go on this way till all of me disappears
Live in a bubble and in my trouble drowning in my tears
(I keep on crying for help but you turned your back on me)
I'm over my head in misery
I guess I'll go on this way till all of me disappears
Live in a bubble and in my trouble drowning in my tears
