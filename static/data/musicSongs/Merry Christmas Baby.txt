Lyrics:


Merry Christmas baby
You sure do treat me nice
Merry Christmas baby
You sure do treat me nice
Bought me a high five of Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

I'm feelin' mighty fine
I've got music on my radio
Feelin' mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
I wanna hug and kiss you
Underneath the mistletoe

Santa came down the chimney
At half past three
Left all his presents
Yeah for you and me
Merry Christmas baby
You sure been good to me
You know I love you baby
And I'm happy as a man can be
