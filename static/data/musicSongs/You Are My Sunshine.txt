Lyrics:


You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

The other night dear as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke dear I was mistaken
And I held my head and cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear how much I love you

Please don't take my sunshine away
Please don't take my sunshine away
Please don't take my sunshine away
Please don't take my sunshine away
