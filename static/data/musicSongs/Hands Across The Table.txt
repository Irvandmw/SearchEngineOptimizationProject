Lyrics:


Hands across the table
While the lights are low
Go you hush your lips your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know

Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way
That you belong to me

Hands across the table
While the lights are low
Go you hush your lips your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know

Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way
That you belong to me
