Lyrics:


I took you for my bride in a brand new world
I'll keep you by my side in a brand new world
Whatever fate may yield
I'll be your sword and shield
I'll keep you by my side in a brand new world

The weather may be cruel in a brand new world
Man may be the fool in a brand new world
Fashion sure will change
Science may go strange
But I'll keep you by my side in a brand new world

Our children will be born in a brand new world
Friendships may be torn in a brand new world
Whatever comes to be
I know you'll stand by me
I'll keep you by my side in a brand new world

We won't take a plane into a brand new world
We won't ride the train into a brand new world
We won't ride the bus
The world will come to us
I'll keep you by my side in a brand new world

We might be unphased in a brand new world
We'll surely be amazed in a brand new world
Whatever comes to be
I know you'll stand by me
I'll keep you by my side in a brand new world
