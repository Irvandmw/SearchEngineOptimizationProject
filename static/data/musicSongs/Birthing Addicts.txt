Lyrics:


Pupils begin to observe
Watching the waste on this earth
Mamas don't love their kids like they used to
Letting them smoke their herbs

Nails bitten down to the nub
Palms out of fire as they rub
Soup never reaches its boil
Dinner ain't the only thing they spoil

Let the maggots and worms infest your brain
Got your memory of all fall, times begin
Let that hell of a drug emerge in your veins
And I will claim that I love you
And I am the one who birthed you

Skin tearin' down to the bone
Freckles fall off as they're told
You realize soon your identity changes
No longer the person you were
No longer the person they adore

Let the maggots and worms infest your brain
Got your memory of all fall, times begin
Let that hell of a drug emerge in your veins
And I will claim that I love you
And I am the one who birthed you

Thank you, mama
For all you've done
Gave me cancer
And thick black lungs
Left me rotting
On the street
Rather shoot up
Than have food to eat

Let the maggots and worms infest your brain
Got your memory of all fall, times begin
Let that hell of a drug emerge in your veins
And I will claim that I love you
And I am the one who birthed you
And I am the one who birthed you

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do [2x]

Mamas don't love their kids like they used to
Letting them smoke their herbs
