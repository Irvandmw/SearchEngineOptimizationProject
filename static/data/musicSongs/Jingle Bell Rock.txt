Lyrics:


Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
The jingle bell hop has just begun

Jingle bell time
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell rock

Itâs the right time; itâs the bright time to rock the night away
Jingle bell time itâs a swell time to go riding in a one horse sleigh

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square
Throw âem up, throw âem up, in the air

Jingle bell time
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell rock

Watch it go [8x]
Hey [2x]

Jingle bell time
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell rock
