Lyrics:


Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy on me.
Lord have mercy,
Lord have mercy on me.
Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord,
Have mercy if you please.

I used to have plenty of money,
The finest clothes in town,
But bad luck and trouble overtaken me,
Bound to get me down.

Please have mercy,
Lord have mercy on me.
Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord,
Have mercy if you please.

Keep on working now, child.
Lord every morning.

Well if I've been a bad boy, baby,
I declare I'll change my ways.
I don't want bad luck and trouble
To follow me all my days.

[Chorus]
