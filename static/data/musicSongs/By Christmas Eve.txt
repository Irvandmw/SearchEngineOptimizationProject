Lyrics:


I'm a thousand miles away
It's not snowing in L.A.
But I'm phoning just to say
I'm sorry

All the flights have been delayed
I've got nowhere here to stay
But if I can find my way
I'll hurry

Just hang up the Christmas lights
And I'll do the rest tonight
Just tell the kids I'm coming
I swear that I'll be running

And under the Christmas tree
Together, yeah, we will be
I promise

I'm gonna walk
If I have to run
I'll stand on the highway
And stop someone
I'll cross the deserts, an ocean
A river that's frozen
I'll follow the stars
Just to find where you are

You can count on me
Make a wish, close your eyes and believe
I'll be home, home, home, home, home
By Christmas Eve

And I know it's all on you
Keep it together like you're glue
And everything you do
I notice

So I'll bring presents, I'll bring wine
Mistletoe for you and I
And I'll be there just in time
To show it

Just hang up the Christmas lights
And I'll do the rest tonight
And tell the kids I'm coming
I swear that I'll be running

Under the Christmas tree
Together, yeah, we will be
I promise

I'm gonna walk
If I have to run
I'll stand on the highway
And stop someone
I'll cross the deserts, an ocean
A river that's frozen
I'll follow the stars
Just to find where you are

You can count on me
Make a wish, close your eyes and believe
I'll be home, home, home, home, home
By Christmas Eve

I'll find my way back to California
I'll follow the map, yeah, to somewhere warmer
I'll carry my bags just until I can hold you again

I'm gonna walk
If I have to run
I'll stand on the highway
And stop someone
I'll cross the deserts, an ocean
A river that's frozen
I'll follow the stars
Just to find where you are

You can count on me
Make a wish, close your eyes and believe
I'll be home, home, home, home, home
By Christmas Eve
