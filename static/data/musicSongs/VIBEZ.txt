Let's go
You know it's baby, nigga
(Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)

She wanna fuck with me but I don't got the time
I just hopped off a private plane and went and hopped on 85
Go call my chauffeur bitch, cause' I don't like to drive
We in suburban's back to back and we gone fill em' up with vibes

Fill em' with vibes
Get in the ride
And no, a nigga not blind
But I keep that stick and I'm firing
Ain't met a nigga in life
That's fucking with me
Say he did then he lying
We got so many vibes stuffed in the car
We can fuck them hoes six at a time
I make them hoes say that nigga so fine
Girl he got that D you can feel in yo spine
Yeah that's what they say about Baby
You know them bitches don't play about Baby
Baby should go run for president
Look what God did, took his time with me

Got a red and white hoe like a peppermint
Pull up to the hotel, take the vibes in
She gone fuck me and fuck on my brethren
My brother and them
Having three hoes in the king size
I ain't finished yet, get another bitch
Got her riding dick and screaming "He-hah"
Make me proud girl, you a cowgirl
She did a handstand, I'm like wow girl
Got me fucking her upside down
Yeah, we going dumb, say she wanna cum
I'm looking like when? She looking like now
Some mo' came in, say they want it too
I tagged in my brother, bitch I'm out

I know
She wanna fuck with me but I don't got the time
I just hopped off a private plane and went and hopped on 85
Go call my chauffeur bitch, cause' I don't like to drive
We in suburban's back to back and we gone fill em' up with vibes

She wanna fuck on me but I don't got the time
I just hopped off a private plane and went and hopped on 85
Go call my chauffeur bitch, cause' I don't like to drive
We in suburban's back to back and we gone fill em' up with vibes

Look, let's get on a jet
Come give me some neck
She ain't picking up
And her nigga just called, she gone send em' a text
I don't need no doc
Bitch, you know I'm a dog
Better send me the vet
Ever made you a million?
I tell em' riddle me that
Ain't offended me yet
My bitch drink Bacardi
I'm in this bitch feeling like Set
Quarter-mill on my neck
Over two on the crib
Fo' hundred thou on the whip
Dicking down yo lil' bitch
I'm 'bout to go buy me a coupe
Pull up, make the doors raise the roof
Louis V army fatigue
I'm 'bout with a pole like a troop
Baby Ray Allen from three
You leave me open, I'm shooting
We like Martin and Pam at the hotel
We kicking hoes out, get the boot
These hoes catching bodies, they 'bout it
We having new vibes in the lobby
That's wherever we go ain't no problem
I just told a bitch no, she was childish (Bye)

Pulled up like
She wanna fuck on me but I don't got the time
I just hopped off a private plane and went and hopped on 85
Go call my chauffeur bitch, cause' I don't like to drive
We in suburban's back to back and we gone fill em' up with vibes
