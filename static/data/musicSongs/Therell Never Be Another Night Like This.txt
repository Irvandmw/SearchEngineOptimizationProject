Lyrics:


There'll never be another night like this 
a girl like you, to hold an' kiss!  
Oh, there'll never be another night like this 
a girl like you, to love! 

I've been livin' in the past, hangin' on to yesterday 
walkin' down a sad road only leads a man one way 
there are shadows in my eyes, empty fields in my heart  
but you brought all the feelings back, an' given me a start! 

There'll never be another night like this 
a girl like you, to hold an' kiss!  
Oh!... there'll never be another night like this 
a girl like you, to love! 

Touchin' you is touchin' me, like a spirit doin' free 
if the end should come, this is the place I'd choose to be 
you're a second chance at life, and it's better than the first  
for you filled all my senses up, an' quenched a dyin' thirst! 

There'll never be another night like this 
a girl like you, to hold an' kiss!  
Oh!... there'll never be another night like this 
a girl like you, to love! 

There'll never be  
another night like this! 
Don't let go!... I won't let go! 
Show everything there is to show! 

There'll never be another night like this 
a girl like you, to hold an' kiss!  
Oh!... there'll never be another night like this 
a girl like you, to love! 

There'll never be  
another night like this... [to fade]
