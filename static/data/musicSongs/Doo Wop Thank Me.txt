Lyrics:


I wanna thank me
For never quitting
I wanna thank me
For always believing
I wanna thank me for always being a giver
I wanna thank me
Oh, yes I do

And oh, I wanna thank me
For believing in me
And I wanna thank me
For never quitting
I wanna thank me
For doing more right than wrong
I wanna thank, I wanna thank me

And oh-oh, I wanna thank me
For having no days off
I wanna thank me
For never quitting
I wanna thank me
I just wanna thank me and thank me some more
Oh yeah
