Freaks!
Freaks!

Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Freaks gonna bob 2 this

Freaks gonna bob 2 this, I'm sayin'
Comin' with the 100 bpm long playin'
Sadomasochistic groove
Jules gonna bump it 'til the fat girl groove
NPG - "We're here!"
Bringin' the feedback, coming 2 shake back
Hollow body 12-string Marshall stack
I wanna show U one of my purple toys
Step the fuck back cause it make plenty noise

Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Freaks gonna bob 2 this, I'm sayin'
Coming with the shit 2 keep the players playing
Sadomasochistic Groove
The party ain't over 'til the fat girl groove

Freaks gonna bob 2 this (Sadomasochist this groove)
Freaks gonna bob 2 this (This is how we do's it)
Freaks gonna bob 2 this (Sadomasochist this groove) (Freaks freaks)
Freaks gonna bob 2 this (Never gonna lose it) (Freaks freaks)

"Freaks gonna bob 2 that", Kirk said it
People think I'm still fly, I read it
In the Oakland Tribune
They said I dance like I ain't gonna retire soon
Well 'til I die and go and live in my heavenly mansion
I keep the rock-n-rolling in a funky fashion
Speaking of which, my rags are game
When I see the maker, He asks my tailor's name
Yeah, I got a gift
Nothing's gonna make me lose it
Sadomasochist this groove
And now U gotta use it

Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Sadomasochist this groove
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
This is how we do's it
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Sadomasochist this groove
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Never gonna lose it

Freaks gonna bob 2 this cuz I ain't sleepin'
While your CD thinkin' 2 come out, I be creeping
Talkin' 2 the foreigners (Freak freak)
[foreign language] Say what'
Like a chippie on the corner (Wanna party, baby')
The charts don't mean a damn when U free
Double platinum - they don't believe it 2 be
As long as Wild 107 don't play me (Freaks)
The people in Moneyapolis
Yeah, we got 2 be free
I got a gift, y'all (He got a gift, y'all)
And I ain't about 2 lose it (Uh)
Sadomasochist this groove
And now U gotta use it

Freaks gonna bob 2 this (Freaks gonna bob 2 this)
Sadomasochist this groove
Freaks gonna bob 2 this (Freaks gonna bob 2 this)
This is how we do's it
Freaks gonna bob 2 this (Freak gonna bob 2 this)
Sadomasochist this groove
Freaks gonna bob 2 this (Freaks freaks)
Never gonna lose it
Freaks gonna bob 2 this, I'm saying (Freaks gonna bob 2 this)
Sadomasochistic groove (Freaks gonna bob 2 this)

NPG - "We're here!"
Freaks freaks (Frrrreak)
Freaks gonna bob 2 this, I'm sayin'
Comin' with the 100bpm long playin'
Sadomasochistic groove
Jules gonna bump it 'til the fat girl groove
NPG - "We're here!"
Bringing the feedback
Coming 2 shake

Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Sadomasochist this groove (Freaks freaks)
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
This is how we do's it
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Sadomasochist this groove (Freaks freaks)
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Never gonna lose it
Freaks freaks (Freaks freaks)
Freaks freaks (Freaks freaks)

Sadomasochistic groove
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Freaks gonna bob 2 this
Freaks gonna bob 2 this (Sadomasochist this groove)
Freaks gonna bob 2 this (This is how we do's it)
