Lyrics:


[Pink:]
Oh you make it sound so pretty
Even when it's not
Didn't choose but it's the only one we've got
And sometimes I get so tired
Of getting tied up in my thoughts
You're the only one that ever makes it stop

God, it hurts to be human
Without you I'd be losing
And someday we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

But I've got you
You, you, you, you, hey (Hey)
And you've got me
Me, me, me, too

[Khalid:]
Like we're buckled and preparing
For the crash
Like we're walking down a road
Of broken glass
Now if we defeat all odds
And it was us against the world
You can count on me
You know I'd have your back

[Pink & Khalid:]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you I'd be losing
And someday we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

But I've got you
You, you, you, you, hey (Hey)
And you've got me
Me, me, me, too
But I've got you
You, you, you, hey (Hey)
And you've got me
Me, me, me, too

Hope floats away
If you could spend a day in my shoes
Your mind would change
If you knew what I've gone through
We want the same (Yeah, we do)
Maybe then you'd understand
How it hurts to be human (No)

God, it hurts to be human
Without you (Without you)
I'd be losing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And someday we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

But I've got you
You, you, you, you, hey (Hey)
And you've got me
Me, me, me, too
But I've got you
You, you, you, you, hey (Hey)
And you've got me
Me, me, me, too

Oh God, it hurts to be human
