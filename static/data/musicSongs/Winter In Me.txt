Lyrics:


When the autumn colors pass
Through the season's hourglass
Once again, there is winter in me

When November's grass is browned
By the frost upon the ground
It is then, you'll find the winter in me

But underneath the fallen snow
Lies a harvest yet to come
For just as spring is guaranteed
Life is etched into the seed
Time to welcome the winter in me
