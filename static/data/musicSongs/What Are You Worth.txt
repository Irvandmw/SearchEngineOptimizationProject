Lyrics:


Day by, knowing I'm all alone
White lies, lining up on their own
You said you would stand on my side
Regret, it's too late to deny

All the back and forth and yes and no
All the right and wrong and high and low
And you set me up to let me down
But it all comes back around

What are you worth now?
What are you waiting for?
When every battlefield you run from generates a war?
What are you chasing?
What do you think you deserve?
Cause you will never have a thing
Unless you've got your worth
What are you worth?

Last straw as the sky turns to red
Free fall, while I fight to forget

All the back and forth and yes and no
All the right and wrong and high and low
And you set me up to let me down
But it all comes back around

What are you worth now?
What are you waiting for?
When every battlefield you run from generates a war?
What are you chasing?
What do you think you deserve?
Cause you will never have a thing
Unless you've got your worth
What are you worth?
What are you worth?

All the back and forth and yes and no
All the right and wrong and high and low
And you set me up to let me down
But it all comes back around

What are you worth now?
What are you waiting for?
When every battlefield you run from generates a war?
What are you chasing?
What do you think you deserve?
Cause you will never have a thing
Unless you've got your worth
What are you worth?
What are you worth?
What are you worth?
