Lyrics:


Angel of mercy
How did you find me?
Where did you read my story?
Pulled from the papers
Desperate and hardened
Seeking a momentary fix

All I wanted to say
All I wanted to do
Has fallen apart now
All I wanted to feel
I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy I fear

Angel of mercy
How did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy
How did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?

And I see you
I feel you

Fortress of daylight
Caught me on stand-by
Waiting to catch the quickest plane
Fly me to nowhere
It's better than somewhere
That's where I've been and nothing's changed

All I wanted to say
All I wanted to do
Has fallen apart now
All I wanted to feel
I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy for sure

Angel of mercy
How did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy
How did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?

And I see you
I feel you

I'm so lost in you
A tragedy it seemed to be
But what now, but what now
A tragedy it seemed to be
But what now

Angel of mercy
How did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy
How did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?

And I see you
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
