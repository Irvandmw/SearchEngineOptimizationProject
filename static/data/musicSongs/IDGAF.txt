Hook me up, 4
Molly, molly, molly
Try me, try me, try me
Baby Jesus

I don't give a fuck what you heard
That ain't have nothing to do with me
A nigga can't hurt me with words
Couldn't handle the pressure if you was me
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't really care about that talkin'
I don't even fuck with lil' niggas
I only kick it with bosses
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard

I don't give a fuck what you heard, nigga, come see me
Nigga try me like a peewee, I'm 'bout to put that nigga on a T.V
Put 10 on his bitch in a foreign, his bitch a goner, now she wanna meet me (Skrrt)
Can't fuck with a bitch if she boring, bye-bye Felicia, I like 'em freaky
I walk around with that blammer, I set this bitch off but I'm not going to T him
I don't get into that talking, you 'bout to have some problems with Baby Jesus
Bitch, I'm the life of the party, I'm passing out liquor, we rolling up reefer
I done put everybody on a molly, woo, sweating like we got a fever

I don't give a fuck what you heard
That ain't have nothing to do with me
A nigga can't hurt me with words
Couldn't handle the pressure if you was me
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't really care about that talkin'
I don't even fuck with lil' niggas
I only kick it with bosses
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard

Please get that thing out my face
I ain't Rich Homie and I am not Thugger
That boy keep on talking crazy, I'ma fuck his bitch and I won't use a rubber
Don't make me fuck up your world, I'll bust a nut in your girl, fuck up your feelings
Make that lil' bitch have my children, have your ass ridin' 'round wanting to kill me
That boy Baby Jesus, he so disrespectful
He half-way retarded, you know that he special
You gon' need a ladder to get on my level
Run up on me and I'm sendin' that metal
I do this shit on the regular
Fuck who you is, Baby Jesus ain't scared of ya
I tote that Glizzy and I keep it on me
Try me, I'm shootin' that bitch like I'm Kobe
Proceed with caution if you gon' approach me
I might have to do it, I don't mean to shoot it
Don't care what they told you, fuck all the rumors
He got respect? Only on the computer
I got that neck from his bitch on a Tuesday
Every girl flexin', God said Hallelujah
My name in your mouth, that's what got your bitch choosin'
Baby

I don't give a fuck what you heard
That ain't have nothing to do with me
A nigga can't hurt me with words
Couldn't handle the pressure if you was me
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't really care about that talkin'
I don't even fuck with lil' niggas
I only kick it with bosses
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
I don't give a fuck what you heard
