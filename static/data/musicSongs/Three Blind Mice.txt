Lyrics:


Hey yo, 3 blind mice get a peace sign, nice
Boy, my bar so clean need to rewind twice
Gotta board a spaceship just to reach my height
And soon these magazines will relieve my height
Your bars are clever, my âRâsâ are better
Play with constellations, bring the stars together
Going hard forever, I'm never gonna stop
Have em hold they breath everytime the beat gonâ drop
Reebok pumps and a crewneck sweater
Gotta chest bar ready but you wanna play checkers
Stella-ella-olah, clap-clap-clap
Tell that little chicka-chicka to bring that ass back
M-A-C M-I-L-L, -E-R that is how you spell
My name bitch, donât you forget it, and Imma go hard with every sentence

[CHORUS (x2)]
You can get with this or you can get with that
Everytime I meet a chick, she wanna get with Mac
Thatâs just how it is, listen to my song
So if you feeling good, clap your hands and sing along

Hey, my nameâs Mac and its nice to meet ya
I'm all about my cheese like a slice a pizza
So high that Imma type of fever, looking fresh with a new pair of Nike sneakers
Used to be the kid that they thought was a fool,
Badass, momma never taught me the rules
I'm clean, you got some laundry to do, not you ho, nobody was talking to you
On Pluto, see the way I walk on the moon
Gotta cool flow, loadin up my rocket to shoot
Like boom yo, it go bla-oww, so how the fuck you like me now
Cuz my style so unorthodox, this some ham an eggs shit, got some pork and chops
Got em going crazy like a half court shot, you hatinâ cuz I'm cool and perhaps your not

[REPEAT CHORUS]

You can get with this or you can get with that
Ha ha-ha ha-ha ha, ha
Alright yâall, to the beat yâall, party rock yâall, to the beat yâall
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho
And that is the way it goes
