Lyrics:


[Hook x2]
The definition of cool, thats me yo
Ask ya girl about me, bet she know
Iâm the future, you a fake bitch, cleo
All my bitches bad like itâs Shaq shooting free throws

[Mac Miller - Verse 1]
Hey ayo, my first name Mac, my last name Miller
On beats Iâm a monster, Iâm iller than Godzilla
Yeah my skin Vanilla, Iâm hotter than Chinchillas
Hittinâ Vegas for the night and cop a villa
Get my lyrics from ill and my soul from J Dilla
Chillinâ with the sour cause some smoke will kill ya
Iâm just me, tryna cover all these magazines
And bitches try to give me treats like its Halloween
Lilâ old school flavour when its Jerm on the drums
Dodge the bullet points like itâs words from a gun
Spittinâ flames so they burn in my tongue
Bitches wanna fuck but they heard that Iâm young
And they still do, Iâmma stick around call me Mildew
Go and stay in Bel Air like uncle Phil do
Get rich go and buy me a mansion
Get my parents a nice crib up in the Hamptonâs

[Hook]

[Diggy - Verse 2]
Shots at a general, roll like an inner tube
Drinking on tigers blood, thatâs what winners do
It seems as if youâd like to hang from my genitals
Whoa, pause, oh, gosh
It is I, the D to the I
With the two Gâs like itâs Gucci attire
Why, donât ask why, youâre so inquisitive
And these shoes Iâm wearing are only limited
My bad, was that a bit much, a tad
Didnât mean to brag, that was low class
Pardon my rudeness that was so crass
And Iâm always making moves, cause I never procras-tinate
The number one spot is up for grabs â too late
What was that question you asked
Whatâs the definition of CO-OL
If you havenât gotten it by now, oh well

[Hook]

[Mac Miller]
You ain't cooler than me, go get a job bitch
You ain't cooler than me, go get a job bitch
You ain't cooler than me, empty pockets
You ain't cooler than, you ainât, you ainât cooler than me
Little asshole got you so mad
Make âem say ughhhhh
