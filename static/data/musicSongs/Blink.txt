Lyrics:


I'm an eclipse
I'm a shooting star
I'ma make you come quick
Then I'll break your heart
Watch out, watch out for me
I'm smarter than you think
I'm crazy but I'm sweet, you'll see

There ain't nobody like me, baby
So why don't we dance
Don't miss your chance, honey

Better not blink
You better not, blink
Better not blink
'Cause you don't wanna miss this
Better not blink
You better not blink, blink
Better not blink
'Cause you don't wanna miss this

Better not
Better not
Better not
Miss this
Better not
Better not
'Cause you don't wanna miss this

The only one left
That'll make 'em all daze off
I'm an innocent bad bitch
So don't even wait
Watch out, watch out for me
I'm stronger than you think
I'm crazy but I'm sweet, you'll see (You'll see)

There ain't nobody like me, baby
So why don't we dance
Don't miss your chance, honey

Better not blink
You better not, blink
Better not blink
'Cause you don't wanna miss this
Better not blink
You better not blink, blink
Better not blink
'Cause you don't wanna miss this

Better not
Better not
Better not
Miss this
Better not
Better not
'Cause you don't wanna miss this

Better not
Better not
Better not
Miss this
Better not
Better not
'Cause you don't wanna miss this

I'ma rocket ship, I'ma rock this
Yeah, I rock this shit
Rocket ship, I'ma rock this
(Yeah I'm rockin', I'm rockin', I'm rockin', I'm rockin')
I'ma rocket ship, I'ma rock this
Yeah, I rock this shit
Rocket ship, I'ma rock this
Don't miss your chance

You better not blink
You better not, blink
Better not blink
'Cause you don't wanna miss this
You better not blink
You better not, blink, blink
Better not blink
'Cause you don't wanna miss this

Better not
Better not
Better not
Better not
Better not
'Cause you don't wanna miss this

Better not
Better not
Better not
You better not
Better not
Better not
'Cause you don't wanna miss this
