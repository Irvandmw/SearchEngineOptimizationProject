[Intro:]
Blue

[Verse 1:]
Hey how you doin?
I love your body and the way you move it
Girl you and me should make a dirty movie
Let's spend the night together all included, all included

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let's get it on
Let's get it, let's get
Let's get it on
Let's get it, let's get it

[Bridge:]
I wanna hear that wicked body sing for me
And I can play your strings just like a symphony
Just move that, move that booty on top of the beat beat
And make that body sing for me

[Chorus:]
Oh oh oh, sing for me
Oh oh oh, I'll make that body sing for me
Oh oh oh, sing for me
Oh oh oh, I'll make that body sing for me

Sing for me
Sing for me
Sing for me

[Verse 2:]
Oh you're so naughty
Get up and ride it, tonight I'm your papi
Let's finish up this bottle of Bacardi
I'll drink and drive you like a Maserati
Maserati

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let's get it on
Let's get it, let's get
Let's get it on
Let's get it, let's get it

[Bridge:]
I wanna hear that wicked body sing for me
And I can play your stringst just like a symphony
Just move that, move that booty on top of the beat beat
I'll make that body sing for me

[Chorus:]
Oh oh oh, sing for me
Oh oh oh, I'll make that body sing for me
Oh oh oh, sing for me
Oh oh oh, I'll make that body sing for me

Sing for me
Sing for me
Sing for me

[Bridge x2:]
I wanna hear that wicked body sing for me
And I can play your strings just like a symphony
Just move that, move that booty on top of the beat beat
I'll make that body sing for me

[Chorus:]
Oh oh oh, sing for me
Oh oh oh, I'll make that body sing for me
Oh oh oh, sing for me
