Lyrics:


Welcome to my heart where have you been
Welcome to my world please walk walk right in
Welcome to my days they'll all be suuny now
Every doubt and fear will disappear somehow
Welcome to my arms they're open wide
Step in to my heart it's warm inside
Everything I ever wanted just came true
Welcome to my heart I need you
Everything I ever wanted just came true
Welcome to my heart I need you
