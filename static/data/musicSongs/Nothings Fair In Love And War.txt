Lyrics:


I always shoot first
Never ask questions
Never think of consequences
I didn't feel a thing
I didn't feel a thing

I never think twice
No intentions
Never feel the consequences
Until it starts to sting
Until it starts to sting

No!
It never hurt like this before
No!
Nothing's fair in love and war!

Turn out the lights!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
It's too late tonight!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
Your hand
My knife
Your heart
My life
There's no wrong or right
When nothing's fair in love and war!

I never back down
Always in crisis
Left to my own devices
You never meant a thing
You never meant a thing

No!
It never hurt like this before
No!
Nothing's fair in love and war!

Turn out the lights!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
It's too late tonight!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
Your hand
My knife
Your heart
My life
There's no wrong or right
When nothing's fair in love and war!

Turn out the lights!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
It's too late tonight!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
Your hand
My knife
Your heart
My life
There's no wrong or right
When nothing's fair in love and war!
