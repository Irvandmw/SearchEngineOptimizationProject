Lyrics:


I'm always light-hearted and easy
Not a care in this world have I
Because I am loved by an Allie
And I couldn't forget if I try.

She lives far away ov'er the mountains
Where the little birds sing on the trees
And the cabins are covered with ivy
And my Allie is waiting for me.

It's over, it's over the mountains
Where the little birds sing on the trees
And the cabins are covered with ivy
And my Allie is waiting for me.

The day I bid goodbye to Allie
That day I will never forget
For the tears bubbled up from their slumber
I fancied if I've seen them yet.

They looked like the pearls from the ocean
As she wept her tale of love
And she said my dear boy, don't forget me
Till we meet here again or above.
It's over, it's over the mountains
Where the little birds sing on the trees
And the cabins are covered with ivy
And my Allie is waiting for me.
