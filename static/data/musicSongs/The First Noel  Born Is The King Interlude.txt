Lyrics:


The First Noel
The angels did say
Was to certain
Poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they may
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the East
Beyond them far
And to the Earth
It gave great light
And so it continued
Both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Israel

Ohhh
Born is the King of Israel
Israel
Israel
Israel
Israel
Israel
Born is the King, Born is the King
Ha
Born is the King, Born is the King
Ha
Born is the King, Born is the King
Our finest gifts we bring
To the king of
Israel
King of Kings
The First Noel
The angels did say

Born is the King, Born is the King
Ha
Born is the King, Born is the King
Ha
Born is the King, Born is the King
