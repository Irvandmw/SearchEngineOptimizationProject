Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I'd be so wrong if I told you that this song
Wasn't about you, all along

Take my breath away
Like you do and it's okay
Listen closely as I say
The word 'love'

Just let me fall
Into your hands
Don't let the world
Mess up our plans
I'll open my eyes when I land

You have shown me truth
And even when it's hard to use
And I'm going to shout the news

Everybody wants to know
If I'm okay I'm here 
Cause they don't know
The things you spoke my, my love

Just let me fall
Into your hands
Don't let the world
Mess up our plans
I'll open my eyes when I land

If you couldn't see
This is where, 
This is where we're meant to be
So hold on tight to me

I'd be so wrong if I told you that this song
Wasn't about you, all along

Just let me fall
Into your hands
Don't let the world
Mess up our plans

I'll open my eyes 
When I have to land
