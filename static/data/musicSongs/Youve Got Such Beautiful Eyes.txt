Lyrics:


You've got such beautiful eyes
Tell me what you see
You've got such beautiful eyes
You got your eye on me

Can you see the future?
Do I really stand a chance?
You've got such beautiful eyes
This is a real romance

You've got such beautiful eyes
I can see deep inside
You've got such beautiful eyes
I'll bet sometimes they cry

You never saw it coming
When he broke your heart in two
You've got such beautiful eyes
I'd never do that to you

You never saw it coming
When he broke your heart in two
You've got such beautiful eyes
I'd never do that to you

Guys will act strange
They'll try to change
Around a girl like you
They'll leave their pad
Their mom and dad
And everyone they knew

They'll do right if it pleases you
Do wrong if you command
[?] salute
Give chicks the boot
To keep you close at hand

'Cause you've got such beautiful eyes
I can see my reflection
You've got such beautiful eyes
I guess I'll change my direction

Here's what I'll do
I'll follow you
You seem to see the light
You've got such beautiful eyes
They're all I can see tonight

You've got such beautiful eyes
You are all, you're all I can see
You're all I see tonight
