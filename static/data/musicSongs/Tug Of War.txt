Lyrics:


You seem too good
Too good to be true
You're holding me stronger
Stronger than I'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
[Album] {Wondering who you're screwing}
[Radio] Wondering what you're proving

You seem to good
To good to be true
I'm loving you longer
Longer than I'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering what you're doing
I don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
[Album] {Wondering who you're screwing}
[Radio] Wondering what you're proving

[2x]
Tug of war
Sweet as sin
I let go
I fell in
Feel the pull
Call your name
I'm alone
Once again

[Album] {You seem, you seem too good 
Too good to be true 
You're holding me stronger 
Stronger than I'm used to}

Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering what you're proving.

Tug of war
Sweet as sin
I let go
I fell in
Feel the pull
Call your name
I'm alone
Once again

Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
Sweet as sin (You seem too good)
I let go (Too good to be true)
I fell in
Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight) (I'm loving you longer)
Call your name (I will turn to drink)
I'm alone
Once again (Longer than I'm used to)

Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
Sweet as sin (You seem too good)
I let go (Too good to be true)
I fell in
Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight) (You seem too good)
Call your name (I will turn to drink)
I'm alone
Once again (Too good to be true)

(Tug of war)
(Feel the pull) (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
(Tug of war)
(Feel the pull)
