Lyrics:


Can yaâ, can yaâ, can yaâ?
Come on, yeah.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah.

Can yaâ, can yaâ? Come on,
Can yaâ?
Check me out.
Yeah, ah, aha.
Come on.

There's something in the way you move.
Everybody wants you.
(That's right.)
To me you are a shining star.
Baby, what do I do
To make you see you're the one for me?
Baby, won't you realise?
(Come on.)

Girl, we could be doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it all night long.
Makin' it, makin' it, makin' sweet love.

It's the way you move your body
Supersexually.
You are the one for me.
So, baby, move your body
A little closer to me.
So everybody can see.
(That's right.)
There's no doubt that you're what I want,
Everything that I need.
(No doubt.)
'Cause you do me supersexually.
(Supersexually, come on, yeah.)

Come over here. So, what's your name?
(What's your name?)
Everybody's watching.
I'll buy the drinks, I'll play the game
(play the game),
But only if it's worth it.
I guess you heard it all before.
But, baby, I ain't telling lies.

Girl, we could be doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it all night long.
We be makin' it, makin' it, makin' sweet love.

It's the way you move your body
Supersexually.
You are the one for me.
So, baby, move your body
A little closer to me.
So everybody can see.
(That's right.)
There's no doubt that you're what I want,
Everything that I need.
(No doubt.)
'Cause you do me supersexually (supersexually).

To me girls like you don't come everyday.
I like to have some fun, baby. What do ya say?
(All night long. Supersexually.)

Girl, we could be doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it all night long (all night long).
Makin' it, makin' it, makin' sweet love.

It's the way you move your body
Supersexually.
You are the one for me.
So, baby move your body
A little closer to me.
So everybody can see.
There's no doubt that you're what I want,
Everything that I need.
(No doubt.)
'Cause you do me supersexually (supersexually).

The way you move your body
Supersexually.
You are the one for me.
So, baby, move your body
A little closer to me.
So everybody can see.
(That's right.)
There's no doubt that you're what I want,
Everything that I need.
(No doubt.)
'Cause you do me supersexually.

It's the way you move your body
Supersexually.
You are the one for me.
So, baby, move your body
A little closer to me.
So everybody can see.
There's no doubt that you're what I want,
Everything that I need.
'Cause you do me supersexually.
