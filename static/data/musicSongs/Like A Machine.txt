Lyrics:


Got a red eye on
Got a red eye on 
I gotta red eye on
Gonna bring it on, like a war machine
When it hits you like a wave 
Youâre not gonna feel the pain 
Stand and face the rain, like a war machine

You gotta give me a hey, yeah
You gotta give me a hey, yeah
You wanna play this game
You can face the pain, like a war machine
Cominâ thru like
Weâre cominâ thru like
Hey, cominâ thru like, like a war machine

Cominâ like a machine
Fasten the hatchet door 'cause we ainât gonna run no more
Like a machine
This time I wonât let go, either step up or hit the floor
Comin' like a machine
And we might rock the party, Oh! But we ainât gonna hurt nobody
Like a machine
Step up and hear the roar, look up and see the machine soar

You can see it rise, but youâll never hear it fall
But you can see itâs eyes, when it starts to rise like a war machine
When it hits you like a wave, youâre not gonna feel the pain
So stand and face the rain, like a war machine

You gotta give me a hey, yeah
You gotta give me a hey, yeah
You wanna play this game
You can face the pain, like a war machine
Cominâ thru like
Weâre cominâ thru like
Hey, cominâ thru like, like a war machine

Cominâ like a machine
Fasten the hatchet door, we ainât gonna run no more
Like a machine
This time I wonât let go, either step up, or hit the floor
Comin' like a machine
And we might rock the party, Oh! But we ainât gonna hurt nobody
Like a machine
Step up and hear the roar, look up and see the machine soar

This armor that Iâm in, can fight the feelings that Iâve been, Iâve been, feeling 
Because now the time has come, to walk the line and come undone, I will, oh, I will
And I am not afraid, of the power you contain
And I am not ashamed, 'cause the truth defeats the pain

Cominâ like a machine
Fasten the hatchet door, we ainât gonna run no more
Like a machine
This time I wonât let go, either step up, or hit the floor 
And we might rock the party, Oh! But we ainât gonna hurt nobody 
Step up and hear the roar, look up and see the machine soar
