Lyrics:


Somebody's knocking
Somebody's knocking at my door
Somebody's knocking
Somebody's knocking on my door
Well, it must be my woman
Coming 'round here for more

Somebody whispers
Somebody whispers in my ear
Somebody whispers
Somebody whispers in my ear
It must be my woman
I can feel her when she's near

O-o-o-o, she can get right down
O-o-o-o, she can get right down
Oh, it must be my woman
Make me love when I am down
