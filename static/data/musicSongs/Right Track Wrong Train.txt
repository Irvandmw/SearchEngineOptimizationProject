Lyrics:


I'm on the right track, riding on the wrong train
This train of love with you just stops for blues
Signals flashing "heartbreak", there's no stopping the way I'm going
But I got to ride this train until I lose

Well you took control of me right from the start
You put the throttle on me and full speed into my heart
I'm in the tunnel now and I can't see the lights
I'm too far gone to know what's wrong from right

Cause I'm on the right track, riding on the wrong train
This train of love with you just stops for blues
The signals flashing "heartbreak", and there's no stopping the way I'm going
But I got to ride this train until I lose

You are the engineer and I've got to follow you
Danger curves of love is what I'm going through
Every time I think love's running fine
You sidetrack me on a dead end line

Cause I'm on the right track, but I'm riding on the wrong train
This train of love with you keeps stopping for blues, yeah
The signals flashing "heartbreak", and there's no stopping the way I'm going
But I got to ride on this train until I lose

Yeah I got to ride on this train until I lose
Right track, wrong train
I got to ride on this train until I lose
