Lyrics:


Lo-lo-lo-lo-love...

Love's got a hold on me
But I don't think I'm ready
I'm focusing on myself
Love won't keep me steady
And I wonder if everyone's got a love of their own
And who else is left to love me alone

I say oooh, yes I'm falling for you
Let me know if your feeling just like I do
Oooh, I'm kind of confuse
Don't know if I want or if I need this love

Lo-lo-lo-lo-love...

Everyday I'm waiting and I feel like
Everyone has someone on their own life
Oh, and I feel like I'm the only one alone
So someone gotta tell me, do I need love just to be happy?
And I wonder if everyone's got a love of their own
And who else is left to love me alone

I say oooh, yes I'm falling for you
Let me know if your feeling just like I do
Oooh, I'm kind of confuse
Don't know if I want or if I need this love

Lo-lo-lo-lo-love...

Should I walk in the city of danger
Should I stay here on my own
Should I give my heart to a stranger
Could I go through life alone
I'm just thinkin' for me
If I am hopelessly falling for you
What else can I do besides
(Lo-lo-lo-lo-love...)
Love you... oooh

Oooh, yes I'm falling for you
Let me know if your feeling just like I do
Oooh, I'm kind of confuse
Don't know if I want or if I need this love

(Lo-lo-lo-lo-love...)
This love
This love oooh
Don't know if I want or need this love
I don't know
oooh, babe somebody tell me if I need love
