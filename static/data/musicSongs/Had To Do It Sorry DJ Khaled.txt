Lyrics:


[Michael Jackson (DJ Khaled):]
And we can ride- and we can ride the boogie
(We the Best Music!)
You gotta feel that beat
And we can ride- and we can ride the boogie
(Another One)
I wanna rock with you
(DJ Khaled!)

[Chris Brown:]
I've been looking for your DM
'Bout to see this boy slide, that's a DM
Yeah, got into her DM
And I started lining up for the PM, baby
I need a one, two, three-some
I need a girl to throw it back like a refund, I don't mind
Feel that beat (that beat), baby
Bounce that ass and I'm grabbing it like a rebound

'Cause I want a fatty on me
'Cause I keep a Magnum on me
Don't mind, take your time on me
Late night, rub that ass on me, girl
Where you at? I'm tryna find a ya (yep)
I hope them other fellas nevermind ya, yeah, yeah
So I can pull down your blinds girl, I swear

I wanna wake up naked next to you, next to you 
I wanna wake up naked next to you, to you 

And my pad on the East Side, B side
Know you dance like a beast, ah
I, want the breakfast in bed
Body's off like butter spread, girl, you a snack
Got that bass in your trunk
And two Chevy's on the side
We can ride all night, 'cause I'm all papers now

I need a fatty on me
I keep a Magnum on me
Don't pack 24 karats
Release, [?] girl
Where you at? I'm right behind ya, yeah
And tell them other niggas don't bother (yeah)
'Cause I'ma love you all night yeah, I swear, yeah

I wanna wake up naked next to you, next to you 
I wanna wake up naked next to you, to you 

Good morning my moses
French toast and french kiss is what I want
Yeah Folgers, stay over
Sweat pants and hair up in a pony
You know I love that fresh face, ooh woah
Up in that bag, already packed
Bring that ass over to my place, ow
Bring that ass to my place, come on (ooh woo)
My place, place

I wanna wake up naked next to you, next to you 
I wanna wake up naked next to you, to you 

[Michael Jackson:]
And we can ride- and we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love
I wanna rock with you
