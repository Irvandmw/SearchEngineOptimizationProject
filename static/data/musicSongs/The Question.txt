Lyrics:


[Intro]
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Wonder who the fuck I am
Uhh, Yeah, want you to feel it
My voice probably sounds mad raspy right now
I want you all to feel it
So step up on the mic and uhh
Show them what you got tiger

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
So Iâve been lookinâ in the mirror and it still donât make no sense
Iâm askinâ what am I supposed to do?
Iâve done so much in my short lifetime, but I havenât done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures
But Iâm a hostage in my own world
And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just donât see how Iâma cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do, bring this doe, and Iâm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice
Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, Iâve been blessed with much to be expected

[Hook]
What am I doing here
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I hope this feelinâ lasts for fuckinâ ever
I donât want to come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
Cause Iâve been searching for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, who gonna touch me now
And do we ever get to know the truth
Cause everyone seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now Iâm rolling and Iâm sipping lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinking liquor and Iâm smoking weed
And you donât ever do too much if you could never do enough
Wonder why I scream and stare at you
Iâll be there to rescue you, problems you got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, Iâve been blessed with much to be expected

[Hook]
What am I doing here
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Sittinâ in my Bentley, thinkinâ bout these hoes
All I do is kill them, I kill them like Nicole
Simpson, flag crimson, smoke them like Winstons
I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant
Iâm lightinâ up a stogie, Itâs longer than a hoagie
Situationâs gettinâ fishy and I donât eat anchovies
Fuck the world, Kill them all, she answer when I call
If the cops pull us over, she gonâ hide it in her drawers
See I come from a place where stars never shine
And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined
Everybody gotta die, but I ainât everybody
If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard
Iâm a pimp, I ainât lyinâ, but that is not important
Iâm just tryna to buy time, but canât really afford it
Saying ainât that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad
I feel like money in the trash like

[Hook]
What am I doing here
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here
