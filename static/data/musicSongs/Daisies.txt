Lyrics:


Count all the yellow cars you see
Count things that start with 'M'
Look for the strongest, tallest tree
Hold your breath 'til that bend
Whisper a secret to your right
Shout out but make no sound
At the beach, you can fly your kite
The sand isn't far off now

And we're digging up daisies
Yeah, we're digging up daisies

Imagine the castles you will make
Get your bucket and spade
Let's pretend we have baked a cake
Look at the mess we've made
Let's splash some water on our face
Let's get our feet wet
Let's bury Teddy in this place
Let's hold our breath

Yeah, we're digging up daisies
Yeah, we're digging up daisies
And we're digging up daisies
