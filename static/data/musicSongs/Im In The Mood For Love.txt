Lyrics:
Lyrics:


[Spoken:]  Drive through the park slowly, eh Junior

I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love

Why stop and think of weather
This little dream might fail
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one and not afraid

If there is a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight forget it
I'm in the mood for love
