Lyrics:


Darkness bleeding in, the sun is getting low
No diamonds in the trees, only leaves of gold
And our long days in the heat haze starts to fade

We can hide under sheets, under heavy covers
So deep as the night draws in
And we'll be slow hearted lovers 'til the clocks go forward again
Again, again, again yeah

When there's no blue above, gonna keep my summer close
'Cause there's still a field of green underneath the falling snow
When our hands grow so cold and hard to hold

We can hide under sheets, under heavy covers
So deep as the night draws in
And we'll be slow hearted lovers 'til the clocks go forward again
Again, again, again yeah

Stay warm, close your eyes
Let time fly
Stay close, stay right here
Nothing to fear

And we'll hide under sheets, under heavy covers
So deep as the night draws in
And we'll be slow hearted lovers 'til the clocks go forward again
Again, again, again yeah, and again
