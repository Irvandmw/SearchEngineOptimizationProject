Lyrics:


She's a stone cut by the Maker's hands
Speaks a tongue you never understand
I'm a man, the son of what I've seen
Skin and bones, she's more than history

Even now, I feel her
Don't know why I need her
I let down my guard, open my heart to bleed
Strange how this life, passes us by
Still I will never reach her mystery

Leave what's left for undiscovered land
Love's now lost, just hidden in your plan
Take my hand and show me where to go
You and I can do this on our own

Even now, I feel her
Don't know why I need her
I let down my guard, open my heart to bleed
Strange how this life, passes us by
Still I will never reach her mystery

Every single and so you won't give
Everything that you meant

Even now, I feel her
Don't know why I need her
I let down my guard, open my heart to bleed
Strange how this life, passes us by
Still I will never reach, her mystery
