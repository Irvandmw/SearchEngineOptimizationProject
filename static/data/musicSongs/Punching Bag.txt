Lyrics:


I feel it in the morning when I fall out of bed
I never get a break and I can't get ahead
I'm up against the ropes, shaking in my shoes
I take it on my chin, till I'm black and blue

I'm a punching bag
I'm a punching bag
I've had enough of getting beat up
I'm a punching bag

I'm backed into a corner with a Foreman in my face
I can't fight my way out of this place
But I learned to be tough right out of the box
I've graduated from the school of hard knocks

I'm a punching bag
I'm a punching bag
I've had enough of getting beat up
I'm a punching bag
Hit me all you want to, I've got pretty thick skin
Don't count me out, I just might surprise you
When I swing back again

She broke her promise and now she's gonna leave
When she floated like a butterfly it stung me like a bee
She took off the gloves and took a cheap shot
She left me hanging in a pretty tough spot

I'm a punching bag
I'm a punching bag
I've had enough of getting beat up
I'm a punching bag
Hit me all you want to, I've got pretty thick skin
Don't count me out, I just might surprise you
When I swing back again

I wanna set the records straight
Every day life is a heavy weight
You can tear me up, there ain't no doubt
But you ain't never gonna knock me out

I'm a punching bag
I'm a punching bag
I've had enough of getting beat up
I'm a punching bag
Yeah, I've had enough of getting beat up
I'm a punching bag
Hit me all you want to, I've got pretty thick skin
Don't count me out, I just might surprise you
When I swing back again
