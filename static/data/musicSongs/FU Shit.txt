Lyrics:


Nigga yous a bitch on some fucking FU shit
Say yous bout' a bag, but that my crew shit
And you totin' straps, but you will not use it
And I've been had her last, [?]
They say I'm the man, but I've been knew it
You was tryna hit, but that bitch choosin'
In a new whip and that shit movin'
All I see is money so I'm never loosin'

Told that bitch, give me sloppy dome nigga
Only popped a bean, and I pour a 4's nigga
You can come at me, but I'll never fold nigga
We was out here gettin' shit, was in the cold nigga
We was 10 deep, tryna get a fuckin' belt
I sat totin' ratchets, tryna kick into the door
Pop a xanny pill, now my shit going slow
Knew this shit was [?], since my last fuckin' show
Pop a [?], then I let that shit go
We go with my niggas out here bangin' on the 4's
Bitches love to see how my rose shit glow
Hittin' on my phone, better let yo bitch know

Nigga yous a bitch on some fucking FU shit
Say yous bout' a bag, but that my crew shit
And you totin' straps, but you will not use it
And I've been had her last, [?]
They say I'm the man, but I've been knew it
You was tryna hit, but that bitch choosin'
In a new whip and that shit movin'
All I see is money so I'm never loosin'

Posted with my niggas and we quick to let it spray
I hate when nigga [?], cause that shit be lookin' ...
Ride around the city with two bitches from the A
I just copped some Gucci shit, [?]
I was a young nigga, out with a pole nigga
You wanna lean, we pour 4's nigga what do you mean
You was a bro nigga what do you mean
We gettin' dough nigga
I was outside runnin' my bands up, Kilo and we got ran up
Last year got my fans up, this year I'm the man
I be posted in the trap with my Glock 4
They say I'm up next like I didn't know
We just blew a check on some rose gold
Stop it with that fake shit its gettin' old

Nigga yous a bitch on some fucking FU shit
Say yous bout' a bag, but that my crew shit
And you totin' straps, but you will not use it
And I've been had her last, [?]
They say I'm the man, but I've been knew it
You was tryna hit, but that bitch choosin'
In a new whip and that shit movin'
All I see is money so I'm never loosin'
