Lyrics:


Rainy nights I've know for awhile
Getting away from myself again
I was alive but empty inside
Hole in my heart, I never thought I'd mend

No, I really wasn't seeing all the things I should see
Damn, I was getting jaded 'til the day you looked at me

You got those new eyes, honey
Virgin like blue skies, sunny
Everything that you try
Everything gets you high, baby
I've been so blind without your new eyes

Without your new eyes
Without your new eyes
Without your new eyes

This chemistry like candy to me
I'm addicted to the sweet, sleepy haze
So whisper at me, get me wavy
Naked and free, never no room for shame

No, I really wasn't seeing all the things I should see
Damn, I was getting jaded til the day you looked at me

You got those new eyes, honey
Virgin like blue skies, sunny
Everything that you try
Everything gets you high, baby
I've been so blind without your new eyes

Without your new eyes
Without your new eyes
Without your new eyes

You got those new eyes, honey (High, baby)
Virgin like blue skies, sunny (Oh, oh)
Everything that you try
Everything gets you high, baby (High baby)
I've been so blind without your new eyes

(High baby)
Without your new eyes (Oh, oh)
Without your new eyes
Without your new eyes
