Lyrics:


You say jump
And I'll just say how high
You make plans
And I make them mine
When I ask you to come with me
You take your time, you sit there thinking

When I say I love you
Baby, you know that it's true
Cause I drop it all to hold ya
All that matters to me is you

When you say you love me
Well, I don't know if it's true
Cause you're still holding on to something
Like you still got something to lose

She still matters to you
She still matters to you
She still matters to you
Oh-oh

That picture of us, I wanted to post it
But you wanted to keep me a secret
I don't care who see's us kissing
And all my exes, let them listen

When I say I love you
Baby, you know that it's true
Cause I drop it all to hold ya
All that matters to me is you

When you say you love me
Well, I don't know if it's true
Cause you're still holding on to something
Like you still got something to lose

She still matters to you
She still matters to you
She still matters to you
Oh-oh

Something between us seems off balance
Afraid we're falling from where we're standing
Cause I can't hold on if you can't let go

When I say I love you
Baby, you know that it's true
Cause I drop it all to hold ya
All that matters to me is you

When you say you love me
Well, I don't know if it's true
Cause you're still holding on to something
Like you still got something to lose

She still matters to you
She still matters to you
She still matters to you
Oh-oh
