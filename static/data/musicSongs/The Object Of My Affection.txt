Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The object of my affection can change my complexion from white to rosy red
Anytime she holds my hand, tells me that she's mine
There are many girls who can thrill me and some who can fill me with
dreams of happiness
But I know I'll never rest until she says she's mine
I'm not afraid she'll leave me cause she's not the kind who'll be unfair
But instead I trust her implicitly
She can go where she wants and go do what she wants, I don't care

The object of my affection can change my complexion from white to rosy red
Anytime she holds my hand and tells me that she's mine
There are many girls who can thrill me and some who can fill me with
dreams of happiness
But I know I'll never rest until she says she's mine
I'm not afraid she'll leave me cause she's not the kind who'll be unfair
But instead I trust her implicitly
She can go where she wants and go do what she wants, I don't care

The object of my affection can change my complexion from white to rosy red
Anytime she holds my hand and tells me that she's mine
