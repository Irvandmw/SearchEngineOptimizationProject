Song Name: Do You Believe This Town
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The woman next door has gone to the PTA
And stopped to see her best friend's husband on the way
The folks down the street have a different thing
So everyone is putting them down
Do you believe this town?

Deacon Jones preaches brotherly love every Sunday
And forecloses loans on widow's homes every Monday
But the smart guys say it's the only way 
To keep the economy sound
Do you believe this town?

Do you believe they voted this town dry?
Well you won't believe it when I tell you why
The mayor and his cousin and the chief of police
have the bootlegging all nailed down
Do you believe this town?

Do you believe they burned a house down yesterday
You won't believe the reason that they gave
If the folks who lived there had a known their place
They could still be hanging around
Do you believe this town?

Do you believe this town?
