Lyrics:


Hold those blood-shotted eyes
Dip them in Visine and light
Forget my name at midnight
It's OK, I'm a mime

I'm tongue-tied in the night time
Silent, sleepless 'til the sunrise
Claustrophobic with a night light, night light
I'll just wait here for the sunrise
You can crawl back into my life
Until then I'll be a night mime, night mime

Get out of the dark
Get out of the dark
Get out of the dark
Get out of the dark

Stay up late with broken mind
No text from you but I'll be fine
I fall asleep with ocean eyes
I say no words like a midnight mime, midnight, midnight mime

I'm tongue-tied in the night time
Silent, sleepless 'til the sunrise
Claustrophobic with a night light, night light
I'll just wait here for the sunrise
You can crawl back into my life
Until then I'll be a night mime, night mime

Get out of the dark
Get out of the dark
Get out of the dark
Get out of the dark

I'm tongue-tied in the night time
Silent, sleepless 'til the sunrise
Claustrophobic with a night light, night light
I'll just wait here for the sunrise
You can crawl back into my life
Until then I'll be a night mime, night mime

Get out of the dark
Get out of the dark
Get out of the dark
Get out of the dark
