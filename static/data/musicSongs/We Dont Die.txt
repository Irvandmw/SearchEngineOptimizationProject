Lyrics:


I'm down forever, and ever, and ever
I'm here, I'm down to ride
I'm down forever, and ever, and ever
No fear, I ain't tryin to hide

I'm down to ride, on the right side
So you fear where the fans, here's the bright side
I'm a tall order, so I'm on height side
So you chewin' gum niggas, you just bite size
Big shoes to fill, get the right sizes
10, 5 got a nigga feeling a laugh
I'm atleast 11, ground breakin' quick
And I'm atleast a 7, take it however you want
Just a richter scale, just a weight measure
And I can put the land, you can take treasure
See I'm doing this for flawless, it's straight leisure
So to see you niggas hate, gives me great pleasure
To the day my money straight, you know how I curve, well
Look at 12 months semesters, long term
Without a GPS away from the wrong turn
If nothing else from this song learn, learn

We don't die-i-ay, we don't die-i-ay
We don't die-i-ay-i-ay
Lights we take off, nights we take off
And flights we take off
We fly-i-ay-i-ay
We don't die-i-ay, we don't die-i-ay
We don't die-i-ay-i-ay
Cape on my back, tape with my rap
[?] on my map
We fly-i-ay-i-ay

Me flowin', free flowin
Get what you see showin'
Make sure you never cross the line, like you free throwin'
Kinda like a big deal, nah, see I'm more grand
See me, they say Jesus Christ, could it be immortal
And I'm a business man, so it's all planned
So if I say I'm dope, I'm just tryna' cross brand
Well hello, I know that we just met now
But I predict how you react, ready? set, wow
So stay outta my lane, is what I'll advice
My domain is in that plane, where that pilot flies
And if it's really all the same, why apologize?
I'm so big, your dick picture really [?] it's side
Is that what you want me to say
Couldn't make it up myself, nigga marry k
And if it's all crystal clear, then we perrier
Your [?] kill yourself, now have a merry day

We don't die-i-ay, we don't die-i-ay
We don't die-i-ay-i-ay
Lights we take off, nights we take off
And flights we take off
We fly-i-ay-i-ay
We don't die-i-ay, we don't die-i-ay
We don't die-i-ay-i-ay
Cape on my back, tape with my rap
[?] on my map
We fly-i-ay-i-ay

I ain't tryna run, nah, I ain't tryna hide, nah
Say I'm ghost-ridin', that don't mean I'm tryna ride
I ain't tryna talk, I ain't tryna jock
You see the money fall through, I'm just tryna dive
See, don't get your eyes crossed, 'cause I'm kinda live
I'm just tryna save time, let's seek mÃ¡s
We talkin' pies, wha-what kinda pies?
'Cause the ones with the [?] applies
I'm kinda Hov, and I'm kinda Nas
Shoulda be Pep, I'm sayin I'm kinda traumatised
Don't exaggerate, I don't dramatize
I don't fly straight, so I kamikaz'
I'm suited well, with no kind of ties
She out a place with the makeup, that's kinda hot
I'm in a rat-race, for what kinda prize? Well...
But if it's all about chips, then I'm kinda wise, wise, wise

We don't die-i-ay, we don't die-i-ay
We don't die-i-ay-i-ay
Lights we take off, nights we take off
And flights we take off
We fly-i-ay-i-ay
We don't die-i-ay, we don't die-i-ay
We don't die-i-ay-i-ay
Cape on my back, tape with my rap
[?] on my map
We fly-i-ay-i-ay
