Lyrics:


Well my baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt me eyes open, that's no lie
Table's turnin' now it's her turn to cry
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

She used to run around with every man in town
Spent all my money playin' a high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Table's turnin' now it's her turn to cry
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

I used to wake each morning, get my breakfast in bed
I got a worry, she'd ease my aching head
Now she's here and there with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
