Stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Pistol to his mouth
Pistol to his mouth
Pistol to his mouth
We gon' stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Pistol to his mouth
Pistol to his mouth
Pistol to his mouth
We gon' stomp that nigga out (We gon' stomp that nigga out)

Pull up to the party off a molly (of a what?)
Pull up to the party in a 'Rari (skrt!)
Heard it's niggas in there actin' rowdy (Actin' rowdy)
So I'm bouta go do somethin' about it (Somethin' about it)
I'ma pull up with the 30 stick, with the collin' kit
Stephen Curry, how I'm shootin' shit
I can't fuckin' miss
I'm off a perc moving ridiculous, I think I'm seein' shit
Off half a piece, swervin' in the fuckin' Benz
Countin' up Benjamins (what!? what!?)

Don't start no shit, won't be no shit (What!?)
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit (What!?)
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit (What!?)
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit (What!?)

Stomp that nigga out (Out!)
Stomp that nigga out (Out!)
Stomp that nigga out (Out!)
Stomp that nigga out (Out!)
Pistol to his mouth
Pistol to his mouth
Pistol to his mouth
We gon' stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Stomp that nigga out
Pistol to his mouth
Pistol to his mouth
Pistol to his mouth
We gon' stomp that nigga out (We gon' stomp that nigga out)

Don't start no shit, won't be no shit (What!?)
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit (What!?)
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit (What!?)
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit (What!?)

What!?
What!?
What!?
What!?
