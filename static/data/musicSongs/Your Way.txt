Lyrics:


You want it your way
But I want it all day
You should go my way
I can't tell you now
It's goin' to be over
Cause I'm much older
And I can see now
How you run around

So tell me why
Why you gotta be fighting'
With all this hatin' goin' around
Cause I got to know
Cause I don't want no part of this
I'ma stay on my own

And if you lie, I will cry tonight
But I won't need your sympathy
And if you die I will lie alone tonight
I just want you to see

And I know you won't change
That's how you do

You want it your way
But I want it all day
You should go my way
I can't tell you now
It's goin' to be over
Cause I'm much older
And I can see now
How you run around

Please let me now
If you're gonna stay longer
Or if you'll leave me again my friend

Since it's not that fair
You wouldn't care
Just as long as I don't leave you alone

And I know you won't change
Cause that's how you do

You want it your way
But I want it all day
You should go my way
I can't tell you now
It's goin' to be over
Cause I'm much older
And I can see now
How you run around

All these bad thoughts remind me of you
So forget the hate, let you be you
I'll help you through
Just hear me out
There's plenty of room for you

You want it your way
But I want it all day
You should go my way
I can't tell you now
It's goin' to be over
Cause I'm much older
And I can see now
How you run around

You want it your way
But I want it all day
You should go my way
I can't tell you now
It's goin' to be over
Cause I'm much older
And I can see now
How you run around
