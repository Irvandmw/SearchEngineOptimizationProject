Song Name: This Is Where I Belong

Lyrics:


I hear the wind across the plain
A sound so strong, that calls my name
It's wild like the river, it's warm like the sun
Yeah it's here, this is where I belong

Under the starry skies
Where eagles have flown
This place is paradise,
It's the place I call home

The moon on the mountains
The whisper through the trees
The waves on the water
Let nothing come between this and me

'Cause everything I want is everything that's here
And when we're all together there's nothing to fear

And wherever I wander, the one thing I've learned:
It's to here I will always, always return
