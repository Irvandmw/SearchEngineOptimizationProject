Lyrics:


[John Legend - Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
Iâm about to hit the ground

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 1]
Sippinâ yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the Don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Errây day, errây night till Iâm carried home
Forever known, big ballinâ, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, itâs all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

[John Legend - Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
Iâm about to hit the ground

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 2]
I do it cause I feel it
Live it like Iâm talkinâ
Flow so straight but wont a nigga try and ?
Iâm so high, yeah the weed, Iâm still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons
Breads in the bag, call it good marketing
Lifeâs a bitch but I donât cartigan?
That's what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emceeâs Iâm tougher than leather
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg Iâm biting whomever
Cause I don came from a long path
Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray itâs from a tall glass

[John Legend - Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
Iâm about to hit the ground

[Kanye West - Verse 3]
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I canât take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
Iâm an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didnât have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
Iâm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ainât finna change, so we wonât agree again
till then Iâll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

[Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
feeling like my life froze
Iâm about to hit the ground
