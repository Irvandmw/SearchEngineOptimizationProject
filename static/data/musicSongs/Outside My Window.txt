Lyrics:


La-La-La-La
La-La-La La-La-La
La-La-La La-La
[repeat 2 times]

Much has been written about
The world and all its kind of loves
But the sweetest of them all
You seldom will find stories of, oh oh oh oh

My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says sheâll never leave me and I know itâs so

La-La-La-La
La-La-La La-La-La
La-La-La La-La
[repeat 1 times]

You donât have to look around
Or ask yourself if she is there
âCause the fragrance of her love
Says hi with every breath of air, oh oh oh oh

La-La-La-La
La-La-La La-La-La
La-La-La La-La
[repeat 1 times]

You will often hear her name
Describing anotherâs prettiness
But if ever there was choice 
My flower would be the prettiest, oh oh oh oh

My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says sheâll never leave me and I know itâs so

La-La-La-La
La-La-La La-La-La
La-La-La La-La
