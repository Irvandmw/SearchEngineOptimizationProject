Lyrics:


Second hand shoes, second hand clothes
They all call her second hand rose
They all think they're pretty smart
But rose don't have a second hand heart.

I love a little girl who lives across the way
I go to see her nearly every day
But when I get the money I'll take her away
And they can't gather around her and say.

(Second hand shoes, second hand clothes)
they all call her second hand rose
They all think they're pretty smart
But rose don't have a second hand heart.

They tease her about her clothes and things
It's hard to believe some folks could be so mean
But when I get the money I'll buy her the best
I'll take a rose you can have all the rest.

(Second hand shoes, second hand clothes)
they all call her second hand rose
They all think they're pretty smart
But rose don't have a second hand heart.

(Second hand shoes, second hand clothes)
they all call her second hand rose
They all think they're pretty smart
But rose don't have a second hand heart.

(My sweet rose...)
