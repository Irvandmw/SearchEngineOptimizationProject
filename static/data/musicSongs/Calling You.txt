Song Name: Calling You
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I had a dream that you stood right in front of me
And called to me in black and white
Though I could see you / I couldn't reach you
You faded into the light
And when the sun turns a dream to reality
I'm left with such an empty space
I feel your spirit / know that I'm near it
I swear I can see your face
Hear me calling you / calling you
But you just don't seem to answer anymore

Am I supposed to pretend I don't feel the pain
Like it happened only yesterday
No use in trying / to stop the crying
I can't make it go away
Hear me calling you / calling you
But you just don't seem to answer anymore
I'm calling you / calling you
And I'm afraid you won't answer anymore

Where is the healing you promised me
Maybe this feeling will burn in me forever
Hear me calling you / calling you
But you just don't seem to answer anymore
I'm calling you / calling you
And I'm afraid you won't answer anymore
Calling you and I'm afraid that you won't answer anymore
