Lyrics:


Back It, Back it, back it, back it up

Come a little bit closer to me (back it up)
Don't it feel a little nicer to me (back it up)

(ok...back it up...blue... back it up...back it up c'mon )

Back it up talk about temptation baby back it up
Learn a little rotation on me

B.L.U.E, just like that

Feel the baseline
Watch how it moves your waistline
Be mine and the next days headline
Back it up back it up
Come on let's slide no crime let's shine, ice all down your spiine

You be tempting me
Got me questioning
Can I have your cellphone for text messaging
B.L.U.E
Simon, Lee, Duncan and Antony

Gotta admit girl, you got to me
Closer to you babe, I gotta be
Making a lot of men enemies (that's right)
That's the price I'm willing to pay

I'll show you the way if you follow me
On the one way road to intimacy
Got what i want now show me
Back it up don't walk away

[Chorus]
Back it up
Come a little bit closer to me
Back it up
Don't it feel a little nicer tell me
Back it up
Coz we gonna get hot now maybe
More than a little
Caught in the middle
Back it up
Talk about temptation baby
Back it up
And a little rotation on me
Just like that

Now you're talking real slick
And you're confident
Way you're driving that
(you) better back it in
Said you're talking real slick
And you're confident
Way you're driving that
(you) better back it in

Got me uptight with your body heat
Makin' me sweat, girl it's all I need (all I need)
Feelin' your breath when you talk to me
Up in this spot tonight

Checkin' you out while you movin'
Head to toe while you groovin'
Don't you know what you<re doing (oh man)
Workin' that tonight

[Chorus x 1]

Step into the club
Rub a dub dub
Time to have some fun
Someone gladly come
Not into conversation like blah blah blah
Or rah rah rah
When you back it up it ha ha ha
Look everybody now I'm a star
I said I just sing I cant play guitar
Wont you stay I love the way you back it up on me uh
Just like that

Back it up
Come a little bit closer to me
Back it up
Don't it feel a little nicer tell me
Back it up
Coz we gonna get hot now maybe
More than a little
Caught in the middle

Back it up
Come a little bit closer to me
Back it up
Don't it feel a little nicer tell me
Back it up
Coz we gonna get hot now maybe
More than a little
Caught in the middle

Now you're talking real slick
And you're confident
Way you're driving that
You better back it in
Said you're talking real slick
And you're confident
Way you're driving that
You better back it in

[Chorus x 1]
