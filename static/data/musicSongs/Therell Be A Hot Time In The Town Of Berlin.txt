Lyrics:


There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
I want to be there boy, spread some joy
When they take old Berlin

There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Brooklyn boys begin
To take the joint apart, tear it down
When they take old Berlin

We're going to start a row, show 'em how
Paint the town down in Kokomo
Take a hike through Hitler's Reich
Change the heil to whatcha-know-Joe
There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
Yanks go marching in
Well you can never keep them happy down on the farm
After they take Berlin

We're going to start a row, show them how
Paint the town down in Michigan
We're gonna take a hike through Hitler's Reich
Change the heil to give-me-some-skin
There'll be a hot time in the town of Berlin
The Yanks go marching in
Well you can never keep them happy down on the farm
After they take Berlin
