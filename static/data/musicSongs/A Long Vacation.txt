Lyrics:


Summertime's here but it's been so long
It's been a long cold winter, I'm so glad it's gone
Come on baby don't have no fear
School is passed through another year

A long vacation this is gonna be
Everynight this summer save your love for me
I jump in my car and drive clear across town
Just to be with you baby when the lights go down

Just to be with you baby is my one desire
The flames start to burnin' with your kisses of fire
Hold me baby and never let go
That's when I feel like you love me so

One of these days we're gonna settle down
Then I won't have to drive clear across town
You'll be mine through eternity
'Cause that's the way it was meant to be

Just to be with you baby is my one desire
The flames start to burnin' with your kisses of fire
Hold me baby and never let go
That's when I feel like you love me so

One of these days we're gonna settle down
Then I won't have to drive clear across town
You'll be mine through eternity
'Cause that's the way it was meant to be
