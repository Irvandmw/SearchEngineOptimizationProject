Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Sing to me, Mr. C., sing to me 
the song that I've been waiting to hear, 
just for me, Mr. C., just for me, 
and everybody else will disappear . . . 

Smile, though your heart is aching, 
smile, even though it's breaking! 
When there are clouds in the sky, 
you'll get by! 
If you smile through your fear an' sorrow, 
smile and maybe tomorrow, 
you'll see the sun come shining through 
for you! 

Light up your face with gladness, 
hide every trace of sadness, 
although a tear may be ever so near, 
that's the time you must keep on tryin', 
smile, what's the use of cryin'? 
you'll find that life is still worthwhile, 
if you'll just smile! 

[instrumental break]

That's the time you must keep on tryin', 
smile, what's the use of cryin'? 
you'll find that life is still worthwhile, 
if you'll just smile! 

How much do I love you? 
I'll tell you no lie, 
how deep is the ocean, 
how high is the sky? 

How many times a day 
do I think of you? 
How many roses 
are sprinkled with dew? 

How far would I travel 
to be where you are? 
How far is the journey 
from here to a star? 

And if I ever lost you, 
how much would I cry? 
How deep is the ocean, 
how high is the sky? 

[instrumental break]

And if I ever lost you, 
how much would I cry? 
How deep is the ocean, 
how high is the sky? 

One dream in my heart, 
one love to be living for, 
one love to be living for, 
this nearly was mine! 

One girl for my dreams, 
one partner in paradise, 
this promise of paradise, 
this nearly was mine! 

Close to my heart she came, 
only to fly away! 
Only to fly as day 
flies from moonlight! 

Now, now I'm alone 
still dreaming of paradise, 
still sayin' that paradise 
once nearly was mine! 

[instrumental break]

Only to fly as day 
flies from moonlight! 

Now, now I'm alone 
still dreaming of paradise, 
still sayin' that paradise 
once nearly was mine! 

You are never far away from me, 
When we part I hold your memories 
When day has flown . . . 
And through the lonely night, 
I'm not alone!
