Lyrics:


No, oh no

I wasn't lookin' for love when we met
Sometimes we throw it up just to see what we catch
Don't wanna spend a life filled with regret
Right now I know we both have the memory set
I wasn't lifted up when we met
Sometimes it's shot glasses we're raisin' instead
And we can be anything, babe
Who wants you always? Deep inside you in this bed

You got a key to my heart, and it's always open
Door closed, no clothes
No smoke, no smoke either, baby
Door closed, no clothes

It doesn't mean anything changed between us
Just means we don't got the same demeanor
Aisle four, baby, heartbreak clean up
I don't wanna split the dream up (Hey)
Can't no one believe it's you (Brrt)
Can't no one believe but me, upsets you (Hey)
God blessed me when he blessed you
Look who I'm layin' next too
She had a bad gyal attitude
I'm tryna kill her flame
She can adjust her altitude
Whole life on a jetway

I wasn't lookin' for love when we met
Sometimes we throw it up just to see what we catch
Don't wanna spend a life filled with regret
Right now I know we both have the memory set
I wasn't lifted up when we met
Sometimes it's shot glasses we're raisin' instead
And we can be anything, babe
Who wants you always? Deep inside you in this bed

You got a key to my heart, and it's always open
Door closed, no clothes
No smoke, no smoke either, baby
Door closed, no clothes
