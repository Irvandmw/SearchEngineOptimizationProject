Lyrics:


(Roll that tape, roll that tape, roll this tape...)

Since we talked half the night
Feelin' good, feelin' right
Words we spoke brought us close
When we touched it was overdose
On the road, you're back there
You're my friend, Darlin' Dear

Open up, let me in
I am your paladin
When your smile shines on me
I am the seducee
We will fly everywhere
You're my friend, Darlin' Dear
(Play the song)

Pa- pa- pa- party plans, get the phone
Did you read "Rolling Stone"?
Knowing you knock me out
I am your roustabout
Pretty good atmosphere
You're my friend, Darlin' Dear

Oh baby
Oh baby
