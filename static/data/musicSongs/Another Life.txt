Lyrics:


I...
I was the boy
Swallowed up by all the darkness around me
And you...
You were the star
Illuminating up the whole world around you

All of these years gone by
Do you still think of me?
Caught in your gravity

Every night I look out at the sky
Waiting for all of those stars to fall down
I shoulda said everything that I never told you
Is it too late for us now?

Just save a little bit of love
A little bit of love
A little bit of love for me still
And in another life
I'll be yours tonight

I...
Now I'm the man
With a little bit hope left in his heart
You...
You are the one, you are the one
Always just there to reach from the start

Baby, now

Every night I look out at the sky
Waiting for all of those stars to fall down
I should've said everything that I never told you
Is it too late for us now?

Just save a little bit of love
A little bit of love
A little bit of love for me still...

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

All of these years gone by
Do you still think of me?
Caught in your gravity

Every night I look out at the sky
Waiting for all of those stars to fall down (yeah)
I shoulda said everything that I never told you
Is it too late for us now? (oh-whoa)

Just save a little bit of love (oh-oh)
A little bit of love (oh-oh)
A little bit of love for me still
Just save a little bit of love now
A little bit of love
A little bit of love for me still
And in another life
I'll be yours tonight
