Song Name: Without Her
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I spend a night in the chair
Thinking she'll be there but she never comes
And I wake up and wipe the smile from my eyes
And I rise
To face another day without her

It's just no good anymore
When you walk through the door of an empty room
And then you go inside and set a table for one
It's no fun
To spend another day without her

We burst a pretty balloon, took us to the moon
Such a beautiful thing, but it's ended now
And it sounds like a lie if I say I'd rather die
Then live without her

Love is a beautiful thing when it knows
How to swing and groove like a clock
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part
And it's breakin' my heart
To spend another day without her

Can't go on without her
It's all wrong without her
Can't go on without her
It's all wrong without her
Can't go on without her
It's all wrong without her
