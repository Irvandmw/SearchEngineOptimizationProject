Lyrics:


I saw you looking brand new overnight
I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh
You look happy, oh

Flashing back to New York City
Change your flight so you stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right

And now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
And I know that you don't
But if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie to me

It's 3 AM and the moonlight's testing me (Ah)
I know that you've been holding on to someone else and now I can't sleep (Ah)
I ain't happy, oh
I ain't too happy, oh

Flashing back to New York City
I was done, but you undid me
Classic me to run when it feels right

Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While he's taking off my dress
I know she's laying on your chest
I know that you don't
But if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie to me

Singing li-li-li-lie, li-li-li-li-li-lie
Li-li-li-li-li-lie, li-li-li-li-li-lie (Yeah yeah)

I know that you don't
But if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie to me
