Lyrics:


[Eminem]
Ay yo fifâ I was thinking you should go back to doing the shit you used to do

[50 Cent]
Murder them, murder them
They violate, I demonstrate
Yeah, Iâll murder them
Niggas be fronting word up
They stunting till they hurt up
That semi talk Iâll let it buck
I had these niggas running hard
Iâll pull a niggaâs skirt up and have him kicking dirt up
Iâll get a nigga anâ a nigga back up stupid hard
Silence itâs the return of the tyrant
Seeinâ through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand closer to the homie you gonâ to die with
Flames come up out the muzzle wanting shit that I did
Iâm talking like the feds ainât listening
Nigga this is a pool of piranhas youâre fishing in
I give to a nigga if he want it
Better ask niggas about me Iâll be on it
I get to drop, blow out your knot, perfect planning
Hit your back with something hot out the cannon

[Hook]
Itâs murder one, itâs premeditated
Murder, then itâs another one
Back to back, put work in
Itâs murder one, itâs premeditated
Murder, then itâs another one
Back to back, put work in

You know I ainât got the strap on me
Holding that for me

[Verse 2]
Iâm fucked up, it really doesnât matter though
Hundred 9mm shells in the Calico
Wait, niggas drop like dominos
Run for your life, puta si vÃ¡monos
I was taught to see my crew a long time ago
Grew up around cocaine, yeah even my mamma know
I cut a O in the foâ with seven at a time
Made four hundred of that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cindy Lauper bitch, time after time
A nigga shine like a nickel nine
Iâve been talking to the man in the mirror
Nigga so ass they was shaking like Shakira
It seems like my visionâs gettinâ clearer
See me coming with the hammer out, death is gettin near ya
Itâs funny how niggas never hear ya, till you run down on âem
Gun down on âem

[Hook]
Itâs murder one, itâs premeditated
Murder, then itâs another one
Back to back, put work in
Itâs murder one, itâs premeditated
Murder, then itâs another one
Back to back, put work in

Yeah starting to feel like the old me (ha ha)
