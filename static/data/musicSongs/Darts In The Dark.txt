Lyrics:


I don't know the way back to the place where our love lies
Blindfolded, it feels, and we're trying to see out to the sunlight

I used to love with my eyes closed
But now it seems that we just keep

So we just keep dancing around every day
And we just keep playing the same guessing games
And we both know we'll never go back to the start
If we just keep throwing darts in the dark

Darts in the dark
I don't know the way
Back to your heart
I don't know the way
Darts in the dark

I remember you would just keep dancing, too
Find your love 'cause lately, darling, darkness is the moon between us

I used to love with my eyes closed
But now it seems that we just keep

So we just keep dancing around every day
And we just keep playing the same guessing games
And we both know we'll never go back to the start
If we just keep throwing darts in the dark

Darts in the dark
I don't know the way
Back to your heart
I don't know the way
Darts in the dark

Throwing darts in the dark, somebody's gonna get hurt
Throwing darts in the dark, only gonna make things worse
I will never find the center of your heart
If I keep throwing darts in the dark, throwing darts in the dark

[?]
Darts in the dark
I will never find the center of your heart
If we don't stop, if we don't stop shooting darts in the dark
I will never find the center of your heart
I will never find the center of your heart
