Lyrics:


I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream

I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see

Donât try me
Donât fight me
You be you and Iâll be me

They say Iâve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you itâs true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ainât you

Your mum and daddyâs walls
Are covered up in pictures of you

You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into

So sorry, donât worry
Iâm sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say Iâve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you itâs true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ainât you
And it ainât you oh

Oh baby, donât persuade me
I know that you ainât used to no
So let me say it real slow

They say Iâve always known
What I wanted, itâs true
My friends and enemies
Will tell you itâs true
You will find out
I always get it
I get what I want

And they say Iâve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you itâs true
And youâll will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ainât you
