Lyrics:


Dancin' til' the morning on a velvet sky
Racing to the top with golden rays of light
I never felt so free and yet so dangerous
The night was electronic, painted red with lust
I move, you chase, we magnetize
A time bomb was exploding with no warning signs

Dynamite-electrify me all night
Dynamite--just give it to me, I won't fight
Dynamite--you make me feel, it's alright
Dynamite-shine it on me--starlight

Caught up in this moment, I was hypnotized
I couldn't shake this feeling, got me paralyzed
I do, I don't, I think I might
My body was electric like a flash of light

Dynamite-electrify me all night
Dynamite--just give it to me, I won't fight
Dynamite--you make me feel, it's alright
Dynamite-shine it on me--starlight

Chage, a chage is coming
Chage, a chage is coming
I'm feelin' all around me that a change is 'bout  to happen
The energy igniting has become my inspiration
If you take a deeper look you'll find the information
I'm only just a figment of controlled imagination

Dynamite-electrify me all night
Dynamite--just give it to me, I won't fight
Dynamite--you make me feel, it's alright
Dynamite-shine it on me--starlight
