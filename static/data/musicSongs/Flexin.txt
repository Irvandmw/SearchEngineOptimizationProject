Lyrics:


I was flexin', anticipating
I was wondering what I could say
I was driving around, around in circles
It's a miracle I stayed away

Oh, babe

All I want to do is hold you tight
Would you object if I called you mine?
Did you hear me right? I'll do you no wrong
And, baby, no frettin'
I just suggest we get it on

I was flexin', anticipating
I was wondering what I could say
I was driving around, around in circles
It's a miracle I stayed away

It's summertime
You're so fly
You and me
It could be

Summertime
You're so fly
You and me
It could be

I was flexin', chilling on my own
But now I'm all geared up and ready to play
She was walking around, around in circles
It's a miracle I stayed away.

All I want to do is hold you tight
Would you object if I call you mine?
Did you hear me right? I'll do you no wrong
And, baby, no frettin'
I just suggest we get it on

I was flexin', anticipating
I was wondering what I could say
I was driving around, around in circles
It's a miracle I stayed away

It's summertime
You're so fly
You and me
It could be

Summertime
You're so fly
You and me
It could be

It's summertime
You're so fly
You and me
It could be

Summertime
You're so fly
You and me
It could be

Oh. Flexing. Oh.

It's summertime
You're so fly
You and me
It could be

I was flexin', anticipating
I was wondering what I could say
I was driving around, around in circles
It's a miracle I stayed away

I was flexin', anticipating
I was wondering what I could say
I was driving around, around in circles
It's a miracle I stayed away

I stayed away

Flexing

It's summertime
You're so fly
You and me
It could be

It's summertime
You're so fly
You and me
It could be

That's right
