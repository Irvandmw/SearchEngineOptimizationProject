Lyrics:


Bright blue, down-filled sleeping bag
Got it rolled up and thrown in back
Pair of jeans and your hiking boots
And that cute little black swimming suit
Yeah, we can stop on the way outta town
Get what you want and ice it on down
A little getaway time is what I need
Just you and me

Why don't we hook up the old Winnebago
Baby, why don't we go
Rolling down a two-lane
Park it right, by the lake night
Catch a little moonlight
Open all the windows
You and me in the middle of nowhere
We'll build a fire
As soon as we get there

There ain't supposed to be a cloud in the sky
Gonna be all kinds of stars tonight
We'll pull the lawn chairs up real close
Make a few sparks stirring the coals
With that little trailer we can't go wrong
Even if a little bit later on
It starts to rain, we'll go inside
And rock away the night

Why don't we hook up the old Winnebago
Baby, why don't we go
Rolling down a two-lane
Park it right, by the lake night
Catch a little moonlight
Open all the windows
You and me in the middle of nowhere
We'll build a fire
As soon as we get there

We could take off for the weekend
Slow it down and do a little breathing
We'll be way outta town
Fore they'll know we're gone
It's been way too long
How bout it girl, come on

Why don't we hook up the old Winnebago
Baby, why don't we go
Rolling down a two-lane
Park it right, by the lake night
Catch a little moonlight
Open all the windows
You and me in the middle of nowhere
We'll build a fire
As soon as we get there

Why don't we hook up the old Winnebago
Why don't we hook up the old Winnebago
Why don't we, why don't we hook up the old Winnebago
Why don't we, why don't we
