Lyrics:


The air I breathe is the same as you,
And I'd like to know if that's true.
Your heart and mind are controlling you,
Or is it the fact that your bones are blue?
And why is your face so pale?
You say my name, your lungs exhale.
You sigh in regret to what we had.
I didn't know I made you, so mad.

Why, are you...
Afraid of me for being interesting?
I'm, confused...
By the things you say why are you so vague?
Don't tell me, who to be...
I'm not like you, but you're just like me.
Quit making, a fool...
Who the hell are you?
Your bones are blue too.

Now look at you, your grin so big.
When you saw me fall off that cliff.
Your smile melts off when I look at you,
You're glamoured up, but your bones are blue.
I've tried and tried to prove you're wrong,
I know you feel that in this song..
I'm looking through that diamond skin, and all I see is an evil grin.

Why, are you...
Afraid of me for being interesting?
I'm, confused...
By the things you say why are you so vague?
Don't tell me, who to be...
I'm not like you, but you're just like me.
Quit making, a fool...
Who the hell are you?
Your bones are blue too.

...

Why, are you...
Afraid of me for being interesting?
I'm, confused...
By the things you say why are you so vague?
Don't tell me, who to be...
I'm not like you, but you're just like me.
Quit making, a fool...
Who the hell are you?
Your bones are blue too.
