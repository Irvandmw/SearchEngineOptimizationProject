Lyrics:


(Hello?
Hi, its me...can I come over?)

Sometimes I want a shot of your novocaine
I think I found the switch
That turns off the brain
Locate the black hole
That I can jump right through

Cause my ears they won't stop ringing
I won't stand another pick up line
Oh my heart it will stop beating
If I don't see you tonight

I'm throwing down some drinks
And then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak
But I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess
They just lead to a dysfunctional love
Just don't hang up
Just, just don't hang up!

Running away is not the solution
My head's not straight with all this pollution
Electronic gadgets add to the confusion

So, are you on your own?
Or should I take a rain check?
Now am I going home?
Or will I cry my eyes out?

I'm throwing down some drinks
And then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak
But I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess
They just lead to a dysfunctional love
Don't hang up

There wouldn't be so much to say
If I wasn't in this all to stay
Is it too late
For us to communicate?

Speed dialin'
Speed dialin'

I'm throwing down some drinks
And then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak
But I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much

Don't hang up
Cause I want you way too much
Out of luck
Because you're too far for me to touch
Don't hang up
Because I need you way too much
