Lyrics:


[D] We never talk much [H] we never have much to say
[D] We never talk much [H] we do without repartee
[D] We never talk much [H] you ask me what we do all day
[D] We play some records [H] discuss a novel [Both] and we just sit around

[H] We never walk much [D] such crowds in the street below
[H] We never walk much [D] and where would we want to go
[H] We never walk much [D] 'cause walking fatigues you so
[H] We look at pictures [D] I work a puzzle [Both] and we just sit around

[D] We planned a lovely day tomorrow
[H] We thought of everything
[H] We found a canary that we can borrow
[D] And tomorrow we'll sit around and let it sing

[H] We suit each other [D] we both think the same as one
[H] With one another [D] just staring at wall's is fun
[H] I must tell mother [D] her warnings were overdue
[H] Don't know what to do [D] what is it to do
[Both] We just sit around

[H] We suit each other [D] we both think the same as one
[H] With one another [D] just staring at wall's is fun
[H] I must tell mother [D] her warnings were overdue
[H] Don't know what to do [D] what is it to do
[Both] We just sit around
[Both] Sit around
[Both] Sit around
