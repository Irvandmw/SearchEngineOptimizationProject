Lyrics:


Here on earth there's so much confusion
People live in a kind of illusion
Somebody else is making things better
But some how we gotta do it together
I am just a true believer
When it comes to giving I'm an over achiever

As long as I live theres more I can give
Theres never enough  (I'll Give) Anything but up
as far as I go theres one thing I'll know
It's never too tough, oh no (I'll Give) Anything but up

Some girls are not quite what they seem
A twisted lack of self esteem
Mirrors are all they want to see
That's not the way that this should be
Sometimes the world is just so small
You could reach anybody just by giving your all

As long as I live there's more I can give
There's never enough (I'll Give) Anything but up
As far as I go there's one thing I'll know
It's never top tough, oh no (I'll Give) Anything but up

I'll give anything but up
I'll give my first breath last words
Every prayer I've heard
Once I start I will not stop
Giving anything but up
Oh, Oh-Oh, Oh

As long as I live there's more I can give
There's never enough (I'll Give) Anything but up
As far as I go there's one thing I'll know
It's never too tough, oh no (I'll Give) Anything but up

The days and the years
The time and the tears
The sound and the sight
Of laughter and light
The healing and hurt
The hours of work
The smooth and the rough
(I'll give) anything but up
(I'll give) anything but up
(I'll give) anything but up
