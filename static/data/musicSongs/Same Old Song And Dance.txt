Lyrics:
Lyrics:


It's just the same old song and dance
The same old song and dance
Turns out you never cared at all
Turns out you bounced me like a ball

Whoever thought I'd fall
For the same old song and dance
It's just the same old smooth routine
The same old moonlit scene

Turns out you only used those eyes
Simply to sell me all those lies
I really went king-size
For the same old song and dance

Me with a built-in radar
Me with a cushion hard
Winding up number one
On the all-time loser's chart

I should forget you but I won't
Should hate you but I don't
It didn't turn out like I planned
But if you smiled and waved your hand

I'd go and hire a band
And wait for one more chance
At the same old song and dance

It didn't turn out just like I planned
But if you smiled and waved your lily white hand
I'd go out and hire a band
Then wait for one more chance
At the same old, same old song and dance
