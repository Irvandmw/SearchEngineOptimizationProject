Lyrics:


(Cheatin' baby cheatin' baby cheatin' baby)
Your cheatin' on me
Cheatin' on me
You're not the kind of a sweetheart I hoped you be
I trusted you thought you'd be true
My love was so strong that I went along
Never dreaming you do me so wrong
Love is a game and I played on the square
But you're the kind who can never play fair
I may forgive but sure as you live
Some day you're gonna be sorry oh you cheated on me

(Don't cry who lied I know all that you've done)
(Each butterfly has to pay for her fun)

I may forgive but sure as you live
Some day you're gonna be sorry you cheated on me
Hah little kidding
You're gonna be sorry sorry you cheated on me
(Cheatin' baby cheatin' baby)
(Both) You cheated on me
