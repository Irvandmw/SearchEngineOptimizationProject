Lyrics:


Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head

Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronise
Don't patronise me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
Here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
And I can't make you love me if you don't

I close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you do not feel when you're holding me
Mornin' will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

And I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
And here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart
I'll feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
And I can't make you love me if you don't

There ain't no use in you trying
There's no good for me, baby, without love
All my tears, all these years, everything I believed in
Baby, ah, yeah

Someone's gonna love me
