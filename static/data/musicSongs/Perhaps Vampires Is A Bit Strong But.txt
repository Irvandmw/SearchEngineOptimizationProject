Lyrics:


I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
What is he doing
What on earth's the plan
Has he got one

You better give me some pointers
Since you are the big rocket launcher
And I'm just the shotgun

Well I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise
But it's true
Said I'm not like you

And I don't want your advice
Or your praise or to move in the ways
You do, and I never will

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

Well I've seen your eyes
As they fix on me
Full of confusion
Your snarl is just so condescending

Try to explain that we're on to a win
If the fee we get in
Near recoups what we're spending

He said I can't believe
That you drove all that way
Well how much did they pay you?
How much did they pay ya?

You'd have been better to stay round our way
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

All you people are vampires!
