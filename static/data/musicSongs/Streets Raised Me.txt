Lyrics:


Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's just how the streets raised me
That's just how the streets raised me

R.I.P. to Bankroll, Frenchie, all we wanted was the Louvre
Remember me and all my dawgs had to share the same clothes
That's just how the streets raised me
That's just how the streets raised me
Air matts, suits with the Air Max sneaks
I've been movin' through the storms, I've been trappin' all week
But that's just how the streets raised me
That's just how the streets raised me

I see my homies on the news again
Grannie told me, "Roddy, you gon' lose some friends"
Everyone knows I can't see the blues again
So I check my surroundings 'fore I move again
Late night lake, I ain't on my own
Two niggas watchin' for me, conference call on the phone
See, I just want to make it where I never need a loan
Ain't never had to hear the static on the telephone
A lot of niggas rap it, but I live it, dawg
Rather do the twenty-five, than be a victim, dawg
R.I.P. to Dopeboy and Keith, I really miss my dawgs
Please watch over Richy while I'm in the trenches, dawg
Apply the pressure then you know a nigga slide
Tried to kill Drew, so we had to ride
Niggas tried to plot on me but I ain't even mad
Either you know me for the music or you know me for a bag
Bust down, bust down, why these niggas hate?
'Cause I came from the bottom and I know these niggas hate
Now it's filet mignon and potatoes on the plate
My dawg really gone, he just waitin' on that date
Main bitch had gone, I said, "I be on the way"
Don't deal with it alone, I hit each and every way
'Cause you was with me runnin' the bank everyday
And she would go down if a nigga ask any day
A lot of times I ask why I go through it
But if you don't know the struggle, you won't know who you with
When my mom say, "Fuck the gang, get these racks and go legit
Go out and get the money, you ain't gotta be super Crip"
When I hop up out that money, McLaren, I'm super drip
New lane, never fond of a call, "Who's this?"
Took all of my dawgs to the mall, blew six
Nigga, you ain't know nothin', I've been on some new shit

R.I.P. to Bankroll, Frenchie, all we wanted was the Louvre
Remember me and all my dawgs had to share the same clothes
That's just how the streets raised me
That's just how the streets raised me
Air matts, suits with the Air Max sneaks
I've been movin' through the storms, I've been trappin' all week
But that's just how the streets raised me
That's just how the streets raised me
