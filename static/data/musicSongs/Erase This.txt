Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Itâs too late to change your mind
Even though this fragile world is tearing apart at the seams
We canât wash these sins away
This sinking feeling everyday: Iâm waking up in someone elseâs life

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause itâs so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this lie

Not gonna let this day go by
Iâm gonna save this wasted life
And nothing can stand in my way
Not enough to say goodbye
Burn it til thereâs nothing left
Iâm drowning in the mess that I have made

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause itâs so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this darkness in me

The waterâs rising around us
There is no other way down
I only have myself to blame for it all

Is it so hard for you?
'Cause itâs so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed could ever come to life again
If I could just erase my mind
But I cannot erase this lie
