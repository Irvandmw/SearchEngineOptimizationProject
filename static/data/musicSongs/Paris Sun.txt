Lyrics:


Your collar pops in the latest style
I feel romance heavy in your smile
Is it just me or the Paris sun?
On this boulevard, making everything so ooh-la-la
Hyper-color and hyper-real
Elevating every single thing that I feel
Like a 70's photograph, making me smile
Making me feel so alive

We can't stay forever this way
So how about we run away
To another lifetime
Where I can be yours and you mine

Language of love on your lips like a song
Heady elixir, you can do no wrong
Is it just me or the Paris sun?
Scorching the boulevard, making you look so ooh-la-la-la

We can't stay forever this way
So how about we run away
To another lifetime
Where I can be yours and you mine
I can be yours
I can be yours
I can be yours

We can't stay forever this way
So how about we run away
To another lifetime
Where I can be yours and you mine
And you mine
And you mine
And you mine
And you mine
