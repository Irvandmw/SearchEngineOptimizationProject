Lyrics:


Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
But don't worry about a thing, hey
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, oh

Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds, by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs, of melodies pure and sure
Saying, "this is my message to you"

Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, oh-oh
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah yeah
But don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright", yeah

Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds, by my doorstep, oh
Singing sweet songs, of melodies pure and sure
Saying, "This is my message to you"

Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, oh
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah yeah
But don't worry about a thing, oh
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright", yeah

Baby, don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah
Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah
Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah
