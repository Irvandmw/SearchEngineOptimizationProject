Lyrics:


Somehow we get through all the tears
And the hurt that seems to build up through the years
And through all the childish names, through lonely nights and games
Why do we do it, there's no sense to it

It's the love that keeps it all together
It's the love that keeps us going forever
It's the love that keeps it all together
If we can keep our hearts about us
Trying hard to never doubt the love
We keep it all together

Somehow we get through all the days
Of each wanting to go our separate ways
And when all is said and done, you know you're the only one
Through every season and you know the reason

It's the love that keeps it all together
It's the love that keeps us going forever
It's the love that keeps it all together
If we can keep our hearts about us
Trying hard to never doubt the love
We keep it all together

It's the love that keeps it all together
It's the love that keeps us going forever
It's the love that keeps it all together

It's the love that keeps it all together
It's the love that keeps us going forever
It's the love that keeps it all together

It's the love that keeps it all together
It's the love that keeps us going forever
It's the love
