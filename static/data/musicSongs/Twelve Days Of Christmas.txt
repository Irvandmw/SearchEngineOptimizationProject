On the first day of Christmas

a partridge in a pear tree! 

On the second day of Christmas  
my true love gave to me...

and a partridge in a pear tree! 

On the third day of Christmas  
my true love gave to me... 
three French hens 
two turtle doves  
and a partridge in a pear tree! 

On the fourth day of Christmas  
my true love gave to me... 
four calling birds 
three French hens 
two turtle doves 
and a partridge in a pear tree! 

On the fifth day of Christmas

On the seventh day of Christmas
