Lyrics:


Well, I though happiness had passed me by
Till I saw that look in your eyes
I though misery had conquered me
But I was wrong as I could be

And now I spend my time with nothing on my mind
Just coastin', yeah, coastin', coastin'
it's fine, I'm gonna tell you one more time

I though loneliness moved right in
But I was wrong once again
When I kissed your angel face
My whole world fell right in place

And now I spend my time with nothing on my mind
Just coastin', yeah, coastin', coastin'
it's fine, I'm gonna tell you one more time

Well, I though happiness had passed me by
Till I saw that look in your eyes
I though misery had conquered me
But I was wrong as I could be

And now I spend my time with nothing on my mind
Just coastin', yeah, coastin', coastin'
it's fine, I'm gonna tell you one more time
