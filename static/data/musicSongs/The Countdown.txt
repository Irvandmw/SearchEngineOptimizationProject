Lyrics:


Sittin' wide awake in a motel dark
Neon buzzin' in my lonely heart
Wonderin' what you're doin', what you're wearin' tonight
I wanna be where you are

Oh, I can feel the rhythm of the wheels goin' round
I play a song and I turn it up loud
Every turn, every town, every city, every minute
I'm countin' down

Five long days to you I sped
Three thousand miles just to get to the one
Oh oh, you know you're the one
Oh oh
It's just five more miles, four streets ahead
Three stoplights till I, I get to the one
Oh oh, you know you're the one
Oh oh

Halfway home, don't know if I can last
Had another cup of coffee, put your picture on the dash
Burnin' both ends and I can't go too fast, no

Oh, I can feel the rhythm of the wheels goin' round
I play a song and I turn it up loud
Every turn, every town, every city, every minute
I'm countin'

Five long days to you I sped
Three thousand miles just to get to the one
Oh oh, you know you're the one
Oh oh
It's just five more miles, four streets ahead
Three stoplights till I, I get to the one
Oh oh, you know you're the one
Oh oh

The countdown to you, girl
The countdown to you, oh

Five long days to you I sped
Three thousand miles just to get to the one
Oh oh, you know you're the one
Oh oh
It's just five more miles, four streets ahead
Three stoplights till I, I get to the one
Oh oh, you know you're the one
Oh oh

The countdown to you
This is the countdown to you
