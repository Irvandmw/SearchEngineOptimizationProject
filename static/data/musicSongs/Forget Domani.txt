Lyrics:


(Let's forget about domani, 

Let's forget about domani, 
Let's forget about domani, 
For domani never comes!) 

Let's for get about domani, 
Let's for get about domani, 
Let's for get about domani, 
For domani never comes! 

Tomorrow, 
Forget tomorrow, 
Let's live for now, and anyhow, 
Who needs tomorrow? 

The moonlight, 
Let's share the moonlight, 
Perhaps together, 
We will never be again! 

Oh what a moon, (che luna) 
Oh what a sea, (che mare) 
With such a moon and such a sea 
And you with me . . . 

I get so dizzy when you're standing near, 
It's not the music that you hear, 
My heart keeps beating like a jungle drum . . . 

Let's take the minutes as they speed away, 
And hope it's true what people say, 
When you're in love, tomorrow never comes! 

(SÃº, dimentichiamo domani, 
SÃº, dimentichiamo domani, 
SÃº, dimentichiamo domani 
perchÃ© forse non verrÃ¡) 

SÃº, dimentichiamo domani, 
SÃº, dimentichiamo domani, 
SÃº, dimentichiamo domani 
perchÃ© forse non verrÃ¡ 

(Domani, forget domani 
con questa luna e questo mare 
e tu con me) 

Let's take the minutes as they speed away, 
And hope it's true what people say, 
When you're in love, tomorrow never comes! 

Let's for get about domani, 
Let's for get about domani, 
Let's for get about domani, 
For domani never comes! 

SÃº, dimentichiamo domani, 
SÃº, dimentichiamo domani, 
SÃº, dimentichiamo domani 
perchÃ© forse non verrÃ¡ 

Domani never comes . . . 
Tomorrow never comes!
