Lyrics:


(one day is like another)

One day is like another,
The sun climbs in the sky,
The twilight brings the echo,
Of your last goodbye!

One day is like another,
The waves cry on the shore,
This empty world is whirling,
Like the day before!

The stars above are quiet eyes,
They only watch to see if we're together,

They never seem to realize,
You didn't mean your love would last forever!

The sun will rise tomorrow,
And circle in the blue,
One day is like another,
Lonely without you!

Un giorno dopo l'altro
La vita se ne va.
Doani sarÃ¡ un giorno uguale a ieri.

Un giorno dopo l'altro,
One day is like another...
