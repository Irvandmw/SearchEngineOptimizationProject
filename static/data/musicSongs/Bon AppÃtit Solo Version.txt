Lyrics:


'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby

Looks like you've been starving
You've got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, boy

Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby

So you want some more
Well I'm open 24
Wanna keep you satisfied
Customer's always right
Hope you've got some room
For the world's best cherry pie
Gonna hit that sweet tooth, boy

Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby

(Go ahead)

Under candle light (under candle light)
We can wine and dine (we can wine and dine)
Please just take your time
Eat with your hands fine
I'm on the menu

(Go ahead)

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby

Bon appÃ©tit, baby
