Lyrics:


Sometimes love burns, sometimes it fades away
But in our case, it lingers through the day
Just kickin' around, just kickin' around

And I can't shake you off, oh oh, oh oh
The love we had is lost, oh oh, oh oh
And I can't shake you, I don't really wanna wait another day
What's the point when the spark has gone away
And I can't shake you

I go, you stay, but things stay the same
We're two dreamers, too afraid to change
Just stickin' around, just stickin' around

And I can't shake you off, oh oh, oh oh
The love we had is lost, oh oh, oh oh
And I can't shake you, I don't really wanna waste another day
What's the point when this love has turned to gray
And I can't shake you

'Cause when I count my blessings, I'm second guessing
You're on my mind and in my clothes, under my skin

And I can't shake you off, oh oh, oh oh
The love we had is lost, oh oh, oh oh
And I can't shake you, I don't really wanna wait another day
What's the point when this love has turned to gray

And I can't shake you off, oh oh, oh oh
The love we had is lost, oh oh, oh oh
And I can't shake you, I don't really wanna wait another day
What's the point when this love has turned to gray
And I can't shake you
