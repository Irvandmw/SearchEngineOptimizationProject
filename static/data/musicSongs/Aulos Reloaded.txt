[6ix9ine:]
Yeah
Greatest rapper alive, greatest rapper alive

I wanted her, she ain't want me, ooh
Now she want me, I don't want her, ooh
Girl on my phone, can't stand her, ooh
If it ain't money don't call me, ooh
Big bank, chase bank, Billy gang, ooh
Face tats, Scum Gang finna game off, ooh
If a nigga want smoke, I'll hit him with the deuce-deuce
Deuce, spread, spread, can't stand beef, ooh

Sucking my dick, yeah, the sloppy, the toppy
The voppy, the woppy, she skeezer, uh
She off of the Molly, I'm off in them shawties
I'm catching a body, she wore all of the blue
Hundreds on them, man, I'm busting, she suckin'
Can somebody pass me a water or something?
Rozay I'm sippin', I'm pimpin', I'm pimpin'
I'm fucking these bitches, I'm sippin', I'm mixin'

Vladimir Cauchemar (Yeah)
Let that shit breathe

I wanted her, she ain't want me, ooh
Now she want me, I don't want her, ooh
Girl on my phone, can't stand her, ooh
If it ain't money don't call me, ooh
Big bank, chase bank, Billy gang, ooh
Face tats, Scum Gang finna game off, ooh
If a nigga want smoke, I'll hit him with the deuce-deuce
Deuce, spread, spread, can't stand beef, ooh
