Lyrics:


In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
We fought the bloody British in the town of New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well we looked down the river and we see'd the British come
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum
They stepped so high and they began to sing
We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing

We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well we fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
And we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon ball and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind

We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
Wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
Oh Papapa, papapa, papapa on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
Wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

They ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
