Lyrics:


(Shorty, shorty, shorty, shorty)
Yeah, yeah (Shorty, shorty, uh, shorty, shorty)
(Tsunami warning)

Take your time, shorty
Don't be in a rush, shorty
.30 around, shorty
Bust shit down, shorty
Man go down, shorty
Take the police, shorty
On high speed, shorty

Molly, I'm geeked, shorty
Can't feel my teeth, shorty
New car, no keys, shorty
Gucci on my fâleece, shorty
You ain't hittin' no stain with me tonight
You ain't gonna eat, shorty
That's on in LMP, shorty
That's who I be, shorty

Givin' you a bag, fâill up a bag
Money get mad, shorty
Pullin' up in front of po po
They can't catch me, I'm in that 'Rari
Pullin' off with your hoe
I might put her on her back, I don't jet-ski
Money be constantly changin' niggas
Money be constantly changin' bitches
That money'll change a nigga
We treat the money like it's a religion
Convicted to the hood
Malicious for the hood
Finessin' for the hood
Came from nothin', like the mud
Better come up with somethin' tough, shorty
This money ain't enough, shorty

I pass the gun to my shorty
Ah, he shoot the shit out your shorty
Ah, I'm a Chicago baby
Ah, where it get bloody and gory
Ah, bro put his brains on the pavement
Ah, I hate foreign niggas, I'm racist
Ah, hunnid, hunnid in that chopper, ggggrrrrahhh
You gon' take it all
(Shorty, shorty, shorty, shorty)
Huh, he dead
Headshots, ain't aimin' at legs
It's your time to die, shorty

Take your time, shorty
Don't be in a rush, shorty
.30 around, shorty
Bust shit down, shorty
Man go down, shorty
(Shorty, oh, shorty, oh)
Take the police, shorty
On high speed, shorty
