Lyrics:


I am literally in the air, right now, rapping up a stewardess
First class, I am so new at this
Used to ride the metro, now they say that's retro
Like the infrareds on my feet, baby let's go
Sinatra what the know me by, Logic what they call me
Gotta catch a flight but the fans wanna stall me
Life of a don, chain just glowin', always in the lab with the fresh kicks on
I'm at the MGM, rocking MCM, Bobby Soxer in my home it's only 10 PM
Got the Rattpack with me going HAM at the hotel
Name brand everything fuck a wholesale
No, I am not materialistic
I was broke my whole life, and no I don't miss it
Last 7 years of my life was in a lab
Working everyday giving it everything I had
Now that a brother is finally recognized
I will not let the limelight hypnotize
Everybody be sure, I'm a always want more
Does anybody make real shit anymore?

The grind never stops, like I'm running from the cops
It's hard to stay humble when you're force-fed props
But I don't give a damn, I am just a man
I am not more important than any one of my fans
First name Bobby so I'm all about The Hundreds
Work so hard errybody think I'm blunted (hah)
Gunning hard with the mask and Glock
And I'm a stay with extra clips 'till the casket drops
Finna blow in the next three years, tops
Talking worldwide, not just hip-hop
Rappers now-a-days so flip-flop
Talking 'bout you, wanna work
Motherfucker kick rocks
I am on the come up, headed to the top
Repping MD, and never will I stop
Me and the crew V's up, Visionary what it do
Step to the mic, lyricism ensues
We go hard, only on campus when I wanna study abroad
Guess that's why they wonder if I go there
All the groupie bitches wanna put they fingers through my hair
Can't feed the thirst, chill out, whoa there
Let me get it, let me bring it back
Haters talking shit but I get richer when they doing that
Yes I am pursuing that, number one album, worldwide
And fuck whoever doubt him - Logic
