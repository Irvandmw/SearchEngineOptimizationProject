Lyrics:


Even though I loved you, 
An' maybe I still do, 
I'd rather have the one I'm with than cry again for you... 
She don't have your magic, 
An' she don't have your style, 
But she don't cross her fingers when she smiles! 

When she smiles, 
She's like a sweet honest child, 
She don't cross her fingers when she smiles! 

The feeling's still still inside me, 
An' I guess it's gonna stay, 
I hope that you don't think that I can't turn and walk away, 
Someone stood beside me through my heartaches and my trials, 
She don't cross her fingers when she smiles! 

She don't use the clever moves, 

That players like you've known, 
She can take me anywhere I'd ever care to go... 

And if you think I'm foolin' 
Then you can have a laugh on me! 
But the day I sell my soul for you, 
Is just a memory... 
And if I ever see you girl, 
I'll stop an' talk awhile, 
I'll probably cross my fingers when I smile! 

She don't cross her fingers 
When she smiles! 

She don't cross her fingers, 
When she smiles!
