Lyrics:


Your heart's just missed another beat
The ground's still moving neath your feet
Your mouth is dry, your eyes are sore
There is nothing certain anymore

You thought that History was dead,
Well it's just whacked you on the head 
It took your money, and you're right
It's coming back to take your pride

Golden days are just a memory
But that's all right cos the market is still free,
The market's free.

Survival of the fittest is a swizz
Law of the jungle is what it is
I hope you still think it's OK
Now it's you who are the prey

Golden days are just a memory
But that's all right cos the market is still free,
The market's free.

Free marketeers were on a roll
Rolling in silver and in gold
But then the market grew too cold 
So they held out the begging bowl

Golden days are just a memory
But that's all right cos the market is still free,
The market's free.

You thought that History was dead
You thought that History was dead
