Song Name: The War Is Not Over
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I slowly walk on down into the night
To see how dreams of people die
They gently fall from windows all around
And crash against the ground like glass
And I'm so sorry I'm so helpless in this angry world
If only I could change it for one day

[Chorus:]
The war is not over, everyone knows it
It's just a reason to make us believe
That someone's the loser, someone's the winner
To make us believe that's the way it should be
But I don't wanna believe

In the story they all say this fairytale has gone too far
I take a step and dare myself to be free
To see how beautiful we are, that everyone can be a star
If only we would start believing in dreams
Believing in who we are

[Chorus:]
The war is not over, everyone knows it
It's just a reason to make us believe
That someone's the loser, someone's the winner
To make us believe that's the way it should be
But I don't wanna believe

But I don't wanna believe
No, no, no, but I don't wanna believe
