Lyrics:


You've been told,
So maybe it's time that you learned.
You've been sold,
Maybe it's time that you earned.

[Chorus:]
I can't stand it.
You're fooling around, I can't stand it.
You're running around, I can't stand it.
You're fooling around with my heart.

I'll explain;
I feel like I'm being used.
Make it plain,
So you don't get confused.

[Chorus 2x]

It's time,
Time for me to let you know.
Ain't no crime,
No crime to let your feelings show.

[Chorus]
