Lyrics:


(Hip-hop-hoop, oh-oh, ha-ha)
(Hip-hop-hoop, oh-oh, ha-ha)

Hip, I didn't know lips could kiss
(Hip-hip)
Hup, I didn't know eyes could flirt
(Hup-hup)
Hope, I didn't know girls could be
Like Tina Marie
(Hop-hop)
Hip, I didn't know  I could sail
(Hip-hip)
Like a pannyboat in the gale
What she's doin'
Will be the ruin of me
(Oh-ho, ah-ha)

Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina
Ah-ha, you sweet little schemer
Tina Marie
(Tina, Tina Marie)
Oh, what you do
Your brand of voodoo
Is too much for me

Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina
Ah-ha, oh, how I dream of
Stealin' your charms
I'm gonna marry you
Some day I'll carry you
Off in my arms

Oh-ho, ah-ha
Hip, I used to be a good time Joe
(Hip-hip)
Kiss a gal and just let her go
(Go-go)
Hope I was really dealin' free till Tina Marie

Mister Cupid you stacked the deck
Why'd you throw me a queen by heck
Now she's braggin'
She's fixed my wagon for me
(Ho-ho, ah-ha)

Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina
You sweet little schemer
Tina Marie
(Tina, Tina Marie)
Oh what you do
Your brand of voodoo
Is too much for me

Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina
Ah-ha, oh, how I dream of
Stealin' your charms
I'm gonna marry you
Some day I'll carry you
Off in my arms

(Oh-ho)
If she tells me to jump in the jump
(Jump-jump)
Hope she tells me to dance in a dance
Gotta listen or get no kissin'
From Tina Marie

(Hip-hip)
Hip, she really did fip my winks
(Flip-flip)
Hope I'm lookin' at wedding rings
Is it human the things she's doin' to me
(Oh-ho, ah-ha)

[Instrumental Interlude]

Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina
Ah-ha, oh, how I dream of
Stealin' your charms
I'm gonna marry you
Some day I'll carry you
Off in my arms

Off in my arms
Oh-ho, ha-ha
Tina Marie
