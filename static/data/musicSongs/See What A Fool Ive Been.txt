Lyrics:


Well she's gone, dear, gone this morning.
I wan' see what a fool I've been.
Oh, Lord, guilty, cruel.
Morning.
Fool I've been.
Yes, I did too much.

Didn't leave, didn't leave no letter.
Didn't leave no warning.
You are noticing.
I guess I'm all to blame.
Oh, Lord.
I guess I'm all to blame.

See you later.
Say...
Ciao.
...night.
Take it.

Oh, my little dog ain't too hungry.
No, no, he kept on barking.
The vicious thing just don't seem the same.
Oh, no, no.
Just.
Oh, don't be.
Said don't feel the same.

See you later.
Now hit it like that.
Coming up strong.

Well, I got so lonely.
Went and told my neighbor.
She said, "Mm mm mm mm mm."
Oh, Lord, what a fool I've been.

And then she told what to do.
She said, "Go home."

Well, she's gone, gone this morning.
See what a fool I've been.
Oh, Lord.
What a fool I've been.

Thank you.
