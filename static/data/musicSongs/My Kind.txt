Lyrics:


Love is the way
Love is the light
We light up today
And today is alright
Love is the way
Love will take us higher
We are aligned
And we are united

We are united by our differences
Our different kinds of interests
Our different intelligences
Artificial or natural mystic
Each one a chrysalis for perfect imperfections
Yeah, we are limitless 'cause spirit lives inside us
Mother nature did us a favor
Gave each one of us a different flavor
Different visions, different faces
Different incarnations of crazy
Some want to make some noise
Some want to hear the silence
Some want to drive the bus from town to town and give out high fives to
Teachers and bakers and movie ticket takers
To midwives and doctors and magic baby makers

'Cause if love is what you're working on
And peace is what you're dreaming
If you're fighting for freedom
You are my people

You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
Humankind
You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
Humankind

I don't believe in fighting
'Cause we ain't got that much time
Tomorrow's ground is a foundation laid down
By decisions that I make today
I don't believe in war (No)
I've been taught to love my neighbor
I've been all around
And all I've found is we're all the same
Yeah, the Chief of Police and the dealer the same
Neither the strongest can survive
Only he who can handle change
The secret to peace is to quiet the brain
Letting go with all our hearts
And letting love touch everything

If love is what you're working on
And peace is what you're dreaming
If you're combatting evil
You are my people

You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
Humankind
You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
Humankind

Yes, we are (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Humankind
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
We share the same room
Your moon is my moon
We all wane and wax
We all wanna take a nap in the afternoon
Some wanna be small spoon
Some wanna be big spoon
I like to rotate positions
And flip it over for a different view
Some like it reggae
Some like it smooth jazz
Some like to slow things down
Some like to shake that ass
So many different expressions to take pleasure in
You are uniquely
You just like everyone else

Love is the way
Love is the light
We light up today
And today is alright
Love is what we're working on
Peace is what we're dreaming
We are all equal
You are my people

You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
Humankind
You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
You're my kind (My kind)
Humankind

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Humankind (Humankind)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Humankind (Humankind)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Humankind (Humankind)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Humankind (Humankind)
