Lyrics:


Moon shinin' bright, up in the sky, 
Looks down on me and I know why, 
Even the stars up in the blue, 
Seem to be shining for no one but you! 

Honey, honey, bless your heart, 
You're the "honey" that I love so well! 
I'd die for you, if you'd only be true, 

You're the "honey" that I love so well" 

[instrumental break]

I'd die for you, if you'd only be true, 
You're the "honey" that I love so well"
