Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last

My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast

My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
