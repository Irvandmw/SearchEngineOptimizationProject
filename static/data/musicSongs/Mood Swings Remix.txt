Lyrics:


Wheezy outta here
Beast, beast

I'm a beast
Oh my God, mood swings
Out of line, mood swings
Out of time
I was broke, I don't cry
I'm the G.O.A.T., I'm a God

I'm a beast, I'm a Goblin, nigga, let that shit fly
Nigga, you don't want no problem
I be feelin' like Batman, my niggas always robbin'
I just got caught fuckin' my best friend, we wylin', yeah

I put it on for my city
They know it's Day1 when they talk about Brissy
She knows I'm busy
Trap keep ringin'
Trap keep ringin'
F-Fuck a mood swing when my bat start swingin' (yeah)
Take a risk and then I dash, dash
Double G up on my bag, bag
I'm runnin' shit like a half back
But you never see pass
Like first things first
Free my brother from the chains
Ain't no brother feel the same
When you both grew up from the dirt
It's crazy that I'm takin' all these planes
And the mood swings change
I will never go back to the hurt
I can't go back to the hurt
I can't go back to the hurt
And word to my mother
If I find it was a killer for my brother
I'ma put that motherfucker in an R.I.P. shirt

I'm a beast, I'm a Goblin, nigga, let that shit fly
Nigga, you don't want no problem
I be feelin' like Batman, my niggas always robbin'
I just got caught fuckin' my best friend, we wylin', yeah

I got a check that I'm waiting to run
All my brothers ready adding the sums
If they talkin' aim it I'm 'on get 'em in one
Have 'em knock 'em bang 'em like the drums
I'm bustin' breakin' out the rooftop
Hear the sound I earned it on my own spot
Yeah I'm so high I'm takin no stops
Got the fire I'm fuckin' my mood clock
Game too critical gotta kill this beat no criminal
Thoughts subliminal gotta go 'fore it get too physical
Price too minimal when you dealin' with me it get ridicule
They not that yeah they on my back they too damn cynical

I don't know, outta' time
I'm so caught out of line
Aderall analyze
Lost my bro, lost my mind
Want my soul, niggas want my life
Tryna' take my hoes, tryna fuck my wife
Mood swings, sometimes I need two at a time
Fuckin' two sets of twins, and one of them shy
Fuck two sets of 10s like a couple of dimes
Fuck two sets of twins like a couple of times
Fuck few sets of twins like a couple of times
Percocets, two times
Percocets, never knew when to come
Percocets, two time
Percocets, never knew when to come

Yeah, yeah
YL, YL
YL, YL, YL
Damn
I keep going I don't stop
Chasin' the bag get the whole guap
Lil' mama in her panty and a crop top
Take her down and she go up
Fuck around to the money she go harder
Swear her friends call me papi I'm her father
All this energy inside she a charger
And her friends wanna cut call me barber
Now they all acting up call it drama
Believe I ain't sticking around for another my g
Stick to the plan I Coach Carter with it
Plant my crop clean it up like a farmer you see
Know that I ain't going back to the reef
I seen them bite in the streets
Know that lil' mama she waitin' to please
Back to a family dependin' on me

I'm a beast
Oh my God, mood swings
Out of line, mood swings
Out of time
I was broke, I don't cry

She was my bestie, mm, never know she was so nasty, mm, yeah
And she so sexy, mm, kissin' on bitches like lesbians, yeah
Ass so fat, oh, bouncin' up and down like a basketball, yeah
Niggas wanna test me, snipe a nigga, treat him like Wesley, yeah
