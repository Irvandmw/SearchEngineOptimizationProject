Lyrics:


Pack your bags baby
We have to go back lets go
Summer paradise oh oh oh oh
Simple plan MKTO

My heart is sinking
As I'm lifting up
Above the clouds away from you
And I can't believe I'm leaving
Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do

But someday
I will find my way back
To where your name
Is written in the sand
(yeah, it was written in the sand)

Cause I remember every sunset
(that's right)
I remember every word you said
(I remember)
We were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
(yeah)
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(yeah I'm a be there)
Oh-oh
(yeah)
I'll be there in a heartbeat
(yeah I'm a be there)
Oh-oh

(Say what)

My soul is broken
Streets are frozen
I can't stop these feelings melting through
(I can't stop these feelings melting through)
And I'd give away a thousand days, oh
Just to have another one with you
(with you yea-a)

Well real life can wait
(hey, if time stand still)
We're crashing like waves
(crashing like waves)
We're playing in the sand
(that's how we do it girl)
Holding your hand
(cause I remember I remember life) 

Cause I remember every sunset
(I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
(goodbye)
Singing la-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
(summer paradise)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(yea I'm a be there)
Oh-oh
(watch)
I'll be there in a heartbeat
(yea I'm a be there)
Oh-oh

Yea love, ha 
If could be with you then baby
We could do what the heart wants
(what the heart wants)
Smiling on a dessert island 
Baby lets get so lost 
(so lost)
Beads are in the heartbeat
Kiss reality goodbye
(goodbye)
Girl you get me high
Underneath the palm trees in the sky
(mmm-hmm)
That's fly
Like everyday's a holiday
A summer paradise
(a summer paradise)
I'm smashing down the highway 
Following the stars for light
(following the stars for light)
A simple plan for life is what you make it 
(is what you make it)
The memories of you and me are ours
For the taking
(ours for the taking)

Someday
I will find my way back
To where your name
Is written in the sand
(It's written in the sand and will be forever baby!)

Cause I remember every sunset
(I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
(never say goodbye)
Singing la-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
(tell me how to get back)
Back to summer paradise with you
(and I'll be there in a heartbeat)

I remember when we first kissed
How I didn't wanna leave your lips
And how I've never ever felt so high
(so high)
Singing La-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
(yeah)
Back to summer paradise with you
(hey!)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(heartbeat)
(yea I'm a be there)
Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat
(yea I'm a be there)
Oh-oh
(summer paradise baby)
I'll be there in a heartbeat
(believe it)
