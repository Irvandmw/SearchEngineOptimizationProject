Lyrics:


[AJ:]
Iâve seen it all a thousand times
Falling down I'm still alive, Am I? Am I?
So hard to breathe when the waterâs high
No need to swim I'll learn to fly, so high, so high
You find the truth in a childâs eyes 
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

[Chorus:]
When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show âem what youâre made of
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show âem what youâre made of

[Kevin:]
Gloves are off, Ready to fight
Like a lion I will survive. 
Will I? Will I?
You gotta stand for something 
Even if you stand alone, donât be afraid
Itâs gonna be alright

[Nick:]
You find the truth in a childâs eyes 
When the only limit is the sky (Woo, woo, woo)
Living proof I see myself in you, (Oh)

[Chorus:]
When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show âem what youâre made of
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show âem what youâre made of 
(Just show âem what youâre made of)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, 
(Just show âem what youâre made of) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Just show âem what youâre made of)

[Howie:]
You find the truth in a childâs eyes 
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you...

[Chorus:]
When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show âem what youâre made of 
(You can show 'em what you're made of!)
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you 
(For you, for you! )
Just show âem what youâre made of 
(You can show âem what youâre made of)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, 
(Just show âem what youâre made of) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Just show âem what youâre made of...
