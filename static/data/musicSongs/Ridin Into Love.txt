Lyrics:


Ridin' into love without a warning
Soon enough 'taint soon enough for me, darlin'
Ridin' mighty proud head up in a cloud
Ridin' into love to see my darlin'

You once promised me you'd be my darlin', darlin'
Soon enough 'taint soon enough for me, darlin'
Loping right along as I sing my song
Ridin' into love to see my darlin'

I'm tired of the doggies and their balling
Tired of this saddle I sit tall in
I only know I hear my true love calling
That's the reason why I'm
Ridin' into love with lips a-sighing, darlin'
Soon enough 'taint soon enough for me, darlin'
Hearts so full of love
You're all I'm thinking of
I'll shout it to the world I love you darlin'

I'm tired of the doggies and their balling
Tired of this saddle I sit tall in
I only know I hear my true love calling
That's the reason why I'm
Ridin' into love with lips a-sighing, darlin'
Soon enough 'taint soon enough for me, darlin'
Hearts so full of love
You're all I'm thinking of
I'll shout it to the world
I love you darlin'
