Lyrics:


New York is my destination.
New York is where I will be from.
New York is made for grander things.
Just. Like. Me.

I will lunch at the Algonquin.
Swing by the Plaza, waltz on in.
The Three Arts Club, I'll live there,
Indefinitely.

New York is made for grander things
Just. Like. Me.

Literati,
Yes, they will love me.
Paparazzi,
Well, could it be?
Glitterati,
Will they know of me?
New York's waiting for me.

All of the tales of seduction.
Glittering on the horizon.
Mountains of fame. And fortune. And snow
Finally.

New York is made for grander things
Just. Like. Me.

Literati,
Yes, they will love me.
Paparazzi,
Well, could it be?
Glitterati,
Will they know of me?
New York's waiting for me.

Practice at the Parnassus
Cram for Columbia classes
Ride the 5th Avenue busses
Weave some tale about us...

I lost all my money for Juilliard.
I hid in the phone booth at ÐÐ°ÑÑ's.
I slept in a brothel, on the way to
Destiny.

New York is made for grander things
Just. Like. Me.

Literati,
Yes, they will love me.
Paparazzi,
Well, could it be?
Glitterati,
Will they know of me?
New York's waiting for me.

New York is made for grander things.
Just. Like. Me.
