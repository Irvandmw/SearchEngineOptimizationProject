Lyrics:


If I ever love again, it will be you
There will be no other one, no one but you
I never want a thing to dim the past
For the love we knew must last

If I ever thrill again, it will be you
And I never will again, to someone new
No one else's charms can fill my empty arms
If I ever love again, it will be you

Cause nobody else's charms can fill my empty arms
If I ever love again, it will be only you
