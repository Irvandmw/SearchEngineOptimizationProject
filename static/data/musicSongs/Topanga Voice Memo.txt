Lyrics:


I can't drive Topanga anymore
'Cause it reminds me of you
Said we buy a big house there someday
But we never got to
'Cause you, and me, and life got in the way
I can't drive Topanga home today

I can't wash with that soap anymore
Because it smells just like you
And I still got your shirts stuffed in the drawer
Because they smells just like you
Hopes and dreams and the promises we made
Down the drain they all got washed away

Funny how we're strangers now and we're different
And the strength of time could turn sweet love to indifference
Yeah I guess we lied when you and I said
"We will try to focus on forgiveness"
And I can't forget it

One of our friends say you've got a girl
And that she looks just like me
And Calabasas is too small of a world
But I don't wanna see it
So I'll stay inside where I know that I'm safe
'Cause you only live a couple miles away

I don't drive Topanga anymore
'Cause it reminds me of you
Smoking and singing love songs in the garden
Like we always used to
And I drive by, I turn my eyes and hide
'Cause when I pass Topanga now I cry
'Cause Topanga just reminds me of you and I
Yeah tears fall, Topanga in my mind
Tears fall, Topanga in my mind
Topanga in my mind
