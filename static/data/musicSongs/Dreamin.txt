Lyrics:


Sitting there, thinking bout us
Girl I don't care
What they say about us
I'm thinking, I'm dreaming
It's our season
She on my phone blowing kisses
That's some things up on my wish list
She on my phone blowing kisses
Blowing kisses, she on my phone

We can go and light up the sky
I know what you thinking
When I look into your eyes
Something like you open my mind
Who you know? Who you know?
It's like real slow...
Where you go? Where you go?
I'm on my way but I don't know
Shout out bad bitch
Is this right here yo song
Hop inside the wraith and let the whole roof gone
That is my bitch she kiss me through the phone
Knew that you was in it
We gone let em all know

Sitting there, thinking bout us
Girl I don't care
What they say about us
I'm thinking, I'm dreaming
It's our season
She on my phone blowing kisses
That's some things up on my wish list
She on my phone blowing kisses
Blowing kisses, she on my phone

Give what you wanted, that's what you wanted huh
Girl you know I'm on I buy it for you
Tell you girl Imma tell you that you're beautiful
Spaceship flying out now I'm gone
She take dick, you know what we be on
I'm wasted smoking backwoods in the morn
I'm famous, I might put you on
We the greatest, ooo
Shout out bad bitch
Is this right here yo song
Hop inside the wraith and let the whole roof gone
That is my bitch she kiss me through the phone Knew that you was in it
We gone let em all know

Sitting there, thinking bout us
Girl I don't care what they say about us
I'm thinking, I'm dreaming
It's our season
She on my phone blowing kisses
That's some things up on my wish list
She on my phone blowing kisses
Blowing kisses, she on my phone

Sitting there, thinking bout us
Girl I don't...
