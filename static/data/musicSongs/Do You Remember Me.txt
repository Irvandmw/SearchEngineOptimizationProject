Lyrics:


Do you remember me, 
As I remember you? 
I know, many years have passed, 
Yet I still can't forget the love we shared. 

Do you ever regret the day, 
You turned and walked away? 
Leaving a dream behind, 
One I never could find again. 

Life went on without you, 
I willed it from my mind! 
But still the memory lingers in my heart, 
Of how we parted. 

Do you remember why, 
You had to say good-bye? 
Do you every now and then, 
Breathe a sigh, shed a tear, for me, 
Wishing we were together, still in love, 
The way that we used to be! 

Do you remember me, 
Holding you tenderly? 
Do you, every now and then, 
Breathe a sigh, shed a tear, for me, 
Wishing we were together, still in love, 
The way that we used to be!
