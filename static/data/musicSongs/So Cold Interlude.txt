Lyrics:


Turn up

When I reached in my drugs, I pulled out a big bankroll
As I scrolled down my contacts, cold as a zombone
(Hehe go right here)

Cold freezer

Whatchu doing
Oh, kinda busy
Whatcha mean "Kinda busy"
I'm-I'm kinda busy, stop it (Shh)
Who's that you're talking to
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Who that? Future over there or something
