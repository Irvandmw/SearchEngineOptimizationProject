Lyrics:


Sometimes love, feels like pain
And sometimes I wonder if it's all the same
Sometimes life, feels just like rain
Cause you never know
When it's gonna fall down on you

I wish you well
I wish you well
On this trip to find yourself
I wish you well
Wish I could help
But I can't help you find yourself

Sometimes faith, feels like doubt
And sometimes I wonder if we'll ever get out
Sometimes life hurts just like now
But you gotta know
It's all gonna come back around

I wish you well
I wish you well
On this trip to find yourself
I wish you well, wish I could help
But I can't help you find yourself

Find yourself
I can't help you find yourself
Find yourself...

And we were sixteen at the time
Nothing could ever change our minds
We were one step below invincible
And we always fought it
You've never been the same
You were so scared to make a name
Then you threw it all away
And I wish you'd come back now

I wish you well
I wish you well
On this trip to find yourself
I wish you well
Wish I could help
But I can't help you find yourself
I wish you well

I wish you well
On this trip to find yourself
I wish you well
Wish I could help
But I can't help you find you

I wish you well
I wish you well
On this trip to find yourself
I wish you well
Wish I could help
But I can't help you find yourself

Find yourself
I can't help you find yourself
Find yourself
I can't help you find yourself...
