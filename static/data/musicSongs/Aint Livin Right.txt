Lyrics:


I need them before the retail
Today I spent thousands, aye
I wanna get my head clouded
Don't wanna have a memory of anything

Put away your problems
I don't sell drugs I cop 'em
I be living like life all wrong
I ain't living right, uh
I ain't living right, yeah
I ain't living right, uh

I ain't living right, aw
I ain't living right, uh
I ain't living right, yeah
I ain't living right, uh
I ain't living right, aw

I ain't living right, no
We from from different sides (Different sides)
I did sacrifice
Then they made me a mastermind
(Mastermind)
I didn't switch, I ain't bend
The coupe got frog eyes (Frog eyes)
We got rich, hey
And I still got Mob ties (Mob ties)
Never sober, I always be high (High)
I be most likely backing the 9 (Backing the 9)
Ain't no question, my niggas gon' ride
(Gon' ride)
You a bitch, you throw rocks and go hide
(Go hide)
I be mixing CIROC with some red (Some red)
Go please wind, it was hard to decide
(Hard to decide)
Drop to my knees and I talk to the God
(Talk to the God)
Never knew man, Ben Simmons my son
(Son)
And I peak, aye
Me and my niggas, we alright (Alright)
On a PJ
Sipping codeine on long fâlights (Long fâlights)
M, I've got her name
Only fucked her for one night (one night)
To get my Rollies, rage
Know Young Gunna ain't living right

And it put away my problems
I don't sell drugs I cop 'em
I be living like life all wrong
I ain't living right, uh
I ain't living right, yeah

I ain't living right, uh
I ain't living right, aw
I ain't living right, uh
I ain't living right, yeah
I ain't living right, uh
I ain't living right, aw

Forgiatos spinning
They look like my diamonds
Page Michael, I got a twin
Bae, that's two times
I'm on two Percs again
Something don't feel right
But this shit real right (Slatt)
This shit real right, uh
This that pure white (Crack)
Your ma need that (Uh)
Lord knows, she needed the nickel blow
To function (Uh)
This that new Maybach
I'ma speed in it (Uh)
Roll some tree in it (Uh)
Fuck a freak in it (Uh)
I'ma do me in it, tinted
All these niggas timid (Uh)
All these niggas pussy (Uh)
Codeine in my sippy cup
I chug it, don't sip a lot
Your bitch on my dick a lot
I guess that's not your bitch, uh!
Funny, laughing to the bank
And it's, funny
Perky in my brain
I'ma junkie (Uh)
Not a dummy, lot of cash
I'm on dummy, I'm a spaz
Chopper leave your ass in the quick past
(Uh)
Every day I dash to the quick cash
I get did that
Gun on my hip, I can't risk that
Desert Eagle, I shoot, knock my wrist back

And it put away my problems
I don't sell drugs I cop 'em
I be living like life all wrong
I ain't living right, uh
I ain't living right, yeah

I ain't living right, uh
I ain't living right, aw
