[Beyonce & Pharrell:]
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

[Jay-Z:]
Yeah, fuck your subpoenas and your misdemeanors
Was too busy touring out all your arenas
My passport is tatted, it look like it's active
I play on these planes, ya'll catch me in traffic
Ya'll drag me in court for that shit, yall backwards
After all these years of drug trafficking, huh
Time to remind me I'm Black again, huh
All this talking back, I'm too arrogant, huh
What would you do, you knew you couldn't fail
I have no fear of anything, do everything well
I have no fear of jail, I was born in the trap
I have no fear of death, we all born to do that
It's just life, I'm just nice
Tonight I might, raise my price
Great advice
Damn you Hov, Jesus Christ

[Beyonce & Pharrell:]
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

[Jay-Z:]
And I'm nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice
Up all night, night, night, night, night, night, night
Running from the lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights
Covered in ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice

[Beyonce:]
Patiently waiting for my demise
Cause my success can't be quantified
If I gave two fucks - two fucks about streaming numbers
Would have put Lemonade up on Spotify
Fuck you, fuck you
You're cool, fuck you
I'm out (ah!)
I ain't never seen a ceiling in my whole life, that's word to Blue
Freestyling live, blueprint from my Jigga who never bribes
I'm so n-n-nice
I'm everybody type, god damn right, I'm so nice, Jesus Christ
I'm better than the hype, I give you life

[Beyonce & Pharrell:]
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

[Jay-Z:]
And I'm nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice
Up all night, night, night, night, night, night, night
Running from the lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights
Covered in ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice

[Beyonce:]
Last name gone be here forever
Now we finna float like feathers
Me and Hova do it like rebels
Most of ya'll jits got pebbles
I got the Rock in the Fellar
Ice lightning bolts from the Heavens
Ya'll gone have to watch us eat
[Pharrell:]
Anybody ever had an error
When things could've been better
Feeling like you was on a stretcher, and all you remember was the Hecklers
But the Universe uplifts that weight
Then you shine like a new feather
Blessings on blessings, et cetra
Feeling like the best year ever, damn, it's nice

[Beyonce & Pharrell:]
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

[Jay-Z:]
And I'm nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice
Up all night, night, night, night, night, night, night
Running from the lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights
Covered in ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice
