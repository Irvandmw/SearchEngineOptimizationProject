Lyrics:


Would you believe me now if I told you I got caught up in a wave?
Almost gave it away
Would you hear me out if I told you I was terrified for days?
Thought I was gonna break

Oh, I couldn't stop it, tried to slow it all down
Crying in the bathroom, had to figure it out
With everyone around me saying, "You must be so happy now"

Oh, if you keep reachin' out
Then I'll keep coming back
And if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
(Light on, light on, light on)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
That I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
(Light on, light on, light on)

And do you believe me now that I always had the best intentions, babe?
Always wanted to stay
Can you feel me now that I'm vulnerable in oh so many ways
And I'll never change

Oh, I couldn't stop it, tried to figure it out
But everything kept moving and the noise got too loud
With everyone around me saying, "You should be so happy now"

Oh, if you keep reachin' out
Then I'll keep coming back
And if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
(Light on, light on, light on)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
That I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
(Light on, light on, light on)

I'll leave the light on, oh
Would you leave the light on?

If you keep reachin' out
Then I'll keep coming back
But if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
(Light on, light on, light on)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
That I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
(Light on, light on, light on)

Oh, if you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
Oh, if you leave the light on
