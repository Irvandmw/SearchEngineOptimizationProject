Lyrics:


I know what people say
They say you don't know how to love
But I want you anyway
You're like a drug and I can't get enough
You'd be great in motion pictures
'Cause baby, you really got me blind
You're the only one I wanna see
You're the only one that does it to me every time

Baby, you're an ocean that's too wide to cross
And baby, you're the cross that's too deep to bear
Baby, you're the star that's too far away
Baby, you're a trip and a half, but I don't care

I know what people think
They think I'm a star struck little fool
But baby, you could be flat broke
I'd still be crazy for you
I know that I'm in love
'Cause I'd change my whole life just to make you smile
And I still can't have you when I want
But when I do it's only for a little while

Baby, you're an ocean that's too wide to cross
And baby, you're the cross that's too deep to bear
Baby, you're the star that's too far away
Baby, you're a trip and a half, but I don't care

You see, it's in my diet (Diet), ooh
Something in the water don't compute, ooh
Baby, I'm quite happy after you give me love
And you can see who's the fool

You're, you're an ocean too wide to cross
(Baby, you're an ocean that's too wide to cross)
(Baby, you're the cross that's too deep to bear)
Yes you are, ooh
(Baby, you're the star that's too far away)
Baby, baby
(Baby, you're a trip, I don't care)
You're a trip and a half, a trip and a half, half
(Baby, you're an ocean that's too wide to cross)
(Baby, you're the cross that's too deep to bear)
You are the star who's much too far away
(Baby you're a trip)
You
Baby
(Baby, you're a trip)
You're a trip, yeah, and a half (Baby, you're a trip)
(Baby, you're a trip)
You're a trip and a half
And I don't, I don't, I don't care, I don't care (Baby, you're a trip)
Baby, baby, no no (Baby, you're a trip)
You're a trip and a half, baby
Trip and a half (Baby, you're a trip)
I'd do anything you want me to do, baby
I'd change my life for you, you (Baby, you're a trip)
You, you are that star who's much too far away
I don't care girl 'cause I, I, I, I love (Baby, you're a trip)
You, love you, baby, oh yes (Baby, you're a trip)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're a trip and a half, a half (Baby, you're a trip)
You're a trip and a half (Baby, you're a trip)
(Baby, you're a trip)

I, I know those people say
They say you don't know how to love
But I want you anyway, baby, you're like a drug
I can't get enough 'cause you
You'd be great in motion pictures, girl
You really got me blind
You'd be the only one I wanna see
Only one that done it every time
I'd do the do with you
You're like an ocean much too wide to cross
You are the cross that's much too deep to bear
You are the star much too far away
But I don't care, you're a trip and a half
I want you every day, hey
