Lyrics:


Tell her that I'm blue and lonely
Dreamy Carolina moon

Carolina moon keeps shining
Shining on the one who waits for me
Carolina moon I'm pining
Pining for the place I long to be

How I'm hoping tonight you go, go to the right window
Scatter your light say I'm all right please please do
Tell her that I'm blue and lonely
Dreamy dreamy Carolina moon

How I'm hoping tonight you go, go to the right window
Scatter your light say I'm all right please please do
Tell her that I'm blue and oh so lonely
Dreamy  Carolina moon
Dreamy Carolina moon
