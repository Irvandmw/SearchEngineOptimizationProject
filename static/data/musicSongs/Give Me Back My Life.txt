Lyrics:


All the walls coming down around me

I know that Iâm fucked up and infected
Iâve been hiding in the fear rejected
Thank God that you finally found me
Cause you got to get me out of here
Iâve been sick and disconnected
Iâve been loving like Iâve been neglected
All the walls coming down around me
And you got to get me out of here

I canât take anymore

I donât wanna to breathe I donât want to die
I canât feel Iâm paralyzed
Iâm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life
I canât breathe I canât fight
I donât wanna feel like Iâm alive
Iâm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life

I know Iâm a walking contradiction
Iâm the truth that you wish was fiction
And this heart isnât known to hate me
I just want to disappear
Iâve been on a self-inflicted mission
To destroy everything Iâm given
Thank God that you finally found me
Cause you got to get me out of here

I canât take anymore

I donât wanna to breathe I donât want to die
I canât feel Iâm paralyzed
Iâm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life
I canât breathe I canât fight
I donât wanna feel like Iâm alive
Iâm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life

You took my pride
You took control
Thereâs nothing sacred anymore
Give back whatâs mine
Give back my soul

I donât wanna breathe
But I donât wanna die

I donât wanna to breathe I donât want to die
I canât feel Iâm paralyzed
Iâm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life
I canât breathe I canât fight
I donât wanna feel like Iâm alive
Iâm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life

I donât wanna to breathe I donât want to die
I canât feel Iâm paralyzed
Iâm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life
I canât breathe I canât fight
I donât wanna feel like Iâm alive
Iâm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life
