Lyrics:


Seems like were holding on forever
I gotta let it go
Time's up, you pushed me to surrender tonight

Who knows what happens now, whatever
Wherever the wind blows
And I'm there as long as we're together
Alright...

Let's have the time of our lives!
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives!

Dreamers don't care if it's right
I think I'm really into you
Restless let's leave it all behind tonight

Crazy when you cross my mind
Oh, the trouble we could get into
So what? Let's just give this a try
Alright

Let's have the time of our lives!
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives!

Looking back
What are we waiting for?
Take the chance
Now's all we got for sure!

Let's have the time of our lives!
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives!
