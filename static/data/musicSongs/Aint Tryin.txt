Lyrics:


I'm way up here, for real I'm over here too you dig?
Running circles around these niggas
Running circles around these niggas, you know, crack

I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm going berserk
I ain't tryna see nobody, I got this work
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm in the sky
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't gon' lie
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't gon' lie

I can't see no pussy nigga like I'm blind
Keep my finger on the trigger at all times
For this cash I don't mind doing the crime (FBG)
Roll this gas in my pockets like I'm slime
Photo Phantom in your hood and I'm sliming
I stay alert, I got millions on my mind
Let's ante up, make me have to push your line
Finna spark with them goonies right behind me

I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm going berserk
I ain't tryna see nobody, I got this work
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't gon' lie

Rolex shades, they don't make these in the States
Green faced Roll, I spent a 100k
40 milli Glock, .40 on my waist
A bunch of killers, dope dealers on the chase
Fuck the snitches cause I'm still pushing weight
I'm getting it in and I came from off the crates
Let's eat again, we done already ate
Fuck the snakes, brought 'em over in a Wraith

I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm going berserk
I ain't tryna see nobody, I got this work
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm in the sky
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't gon' lie
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't gon' lie
