Lyrics:


Girl, I get right on top of you, yeah
Girl, you climb right on top of me, yeah
I'm positive we get this right now, yeah, yeah
I know you probably had to stay down, yeah, yeah, girl

Come over, come over, come over, oh come over
Come over, come over, come over, oh come over

You've got me frustrated like a taurus in the wild
I put my flauting in, I don't need a second shot
You've got me frustrated like a Taurus in the wild
I put my flauting in, I don't need a second shot
Come over, come over, come over, oh come over
Come over, come over, come over, oh come over

She be riding like a bull, oh yeah, baby
No bullshit, I'ma make you moan
And girl you 'bout to get it, baby
I'm positive we get this right now, yeah yeah
I know you probably had to stay down, yeah, yeah, girl

Come over, come over, come over, oh come over (Come over, ooh)
Come over, come over, come over, oh come over (Come over, come over)

You've got me frustrated like a taurus in the wild
I put my flauting in, I don't need a second shot
You've got me frustrated like a Taurus in the wild
I put my flauting in, I don't need a second shot
Come over, come over, come over, oh come over
Come over, come over, come over, oh come over

You've got me frustrated like a taurus in the wild
I put my flauting in, I don't need a second shot
You've got me frustrated like a Taurus in the wild
I put my flauting in, I don't need a second shot
Come over, come over, come over, oh come over
Come over, come over, come over, oh come over
