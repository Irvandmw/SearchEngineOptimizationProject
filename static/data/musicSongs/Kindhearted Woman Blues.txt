Lyrics:


I got a kind-hearted woman,
Do anything in this world for me.
I got a kind-hearted woman,
Do anything in this world for me.
These evil-hearted women,
Man, they will not let me be.

I love my baby,
My baby don't love me.
I love my baby,
My baby don't love me.
Really love that woman,
Can't stand to leave her be.

Ain't but one thing makes Mr. Johnson drink.
Swear 'bout how you treat me, babe, I begin to think.
Oh babe, my life don't feel the same.
You break my heart when you call Mr. So-and-So's name.

I got a kind-hearted woman,
Studies evil all the time.
I got a kind-hearted woman,
Studies evil all the time.
You wish to kill me,
Just to have it on your mind.
