Lyrics:


I always thought I could trust you
but I guess that's not the case
All the years that I loved you
You were out there playing the games
You didn't think that I would find out
but it was written all over the place
Is it what you really want now
Then get the fuck out of my face

How could you deceive me?
Im begging you to leave me
Go to hell
I'm better off without you
All is well
I'd rather be alone
To have you
To hold you
and never know you
'cause you sold me out
You're never gunna live this down
Never gunna live this down

How do you look in the mirror
How do you stand the sight of your face
If you made it any clearer
I could of seen right through the hate
and i'll never think about you
While I'm sleepoing with all of your friends
and I'm hoping that you find out
'cause love is the sweetest revenge

How could you deceive me?
I'm begging you to leave me
Go to hell!
I'm better off without you
All is well
I'd rather be alone
To have you
To hold you
and never know you
'cause you sold me out
You're never gunna live this down
Never gunna live this down

I always thought I could trust you
I always thought I could trust you
GO!
I always thought I could trust you
I always thought I could trust you

So go to hell
I'm better off without you
All is well
I'd rather be alone
To have you
To hold you
and never know you
'cause you sold me out
You're never gunna live this down
Never gunna live this down
