Lyrics:


I'll make believe that I don't miss ya
I can say I'm glad that we're apart
I can tell my friends I'm glad it's over now
But what will I tell my heart

I'll make believe I don't think about ya
Try to pretend we never met
But when I wake up, aw in the mornin' now
You know my pillow is soakin' wet

I know how much I need ya
And at times I almost cried
Makin believe is not so easy
How long can I hold it inside

I'll make believe that I don't love ya
And I never gave my heart away
But I know I'll never, aw be the same dear
You're on my mind both night and day

I know how much I need ya
And at times I almost cried
Makin believe is not so easy
How long can I hold it inside

I'll make believe that I don't love ya
And I never gave my heart away
But I know I'll never, aw be the same dear
You're on my mind both night and day
I think of you both night and day
You're on my mind both night and day
