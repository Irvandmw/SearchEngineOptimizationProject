Lyrics:


Demons hide behind my back
And I can see them, one, two, three, four
Leading me to do their dirty work
Won't let them knock down my door

Oh, the stupid truth
Is I'm so bad for you

Oh-no-no-no, I can't take it
Oh-no-no-no, I won't break your heart again
I don't wanna be a monster among men
Oh-no-no-no, I can't take it
Oh-no-no-no, I won't break your heart again
I don't wanna be a monster among men
Oh, no, don't wanna be a monster among men
Oh, no, don't wanna be a monster among men

Fragile, always 'bout to fall just like sand
Castles, three, two, one, go
Stronghold, it's time for me to admit
That I'm an asshole, so here I go

Oh, the stupid truth
Is I'm so bad for you

Oh-no-no-no, I can't take it
Oh-no-no-no, I won't break your heart again
I don't wanna be a monster among men
Oh-no-no-no, I can't take it
Oh-no-no-no, I won't break your heart again
I don't wanna be a monster among men
Oh, no, don't wanna be a monster among men
Oh, no, don't wanna be a monster among men

Oh-no-no-no, I can't take it
Oh-no-no-no, I won't break your heart again
I don't wanna be a monster among men
Oh-no-no-no, I can't take it
Oh-no-no-no, I won't break your heart again
I don't wanna be a monster among men
Oh, no, don't wanna be a monster among men
Oh, no, don't wanna be a monster among men
