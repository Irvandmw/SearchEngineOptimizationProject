Lyrics:


[Intro]
Come back to the street (yeah) come back to the street (yeah)
Come back to, come back to, come back to the street (Chamillionaire)

[Interlude]
Th-th-they callin me, c-come back to the street (they keep sayin my name)
They-they callin me, they-they callin me (they keep sayin my name)
Th-th-they callin me, come back to the street (they keep sayin my naaaaame)
They-they callin me, they-they callin me

[Chamillionaire â over interlude]
Even when I'm not there I'm there like air
Flesh off the plane from Spain and uhh
Back reclaim the rap game is yours truly
C'mon say it with me, Chamillitary mayne

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
You should worry 'bout you while you worry 'bout me
At the top of the charts is where you know that I'll be
I got the streets on lock and I'm insertin my key
Come back to the streets, come back to the streets

[Chamillionaire]
Yeah! Hold up
I got the game on smash (uhh)
Uhh

Had to make a couple trips up to the islands now I'm internationally known
Had to make another switch (switch) my bravado got the international phone
Had to add a little bit (bit) to the rider; 
first class how I asked to be flown
And they kept ca-allin me tellin me, "Get back in your zone"
These boys is cartoon characters, too much imagination
It's a little too much animation 
callin me cause they know Cham can erase 'em
Traveled all over the world, and my experience is
that y'all experience less, y'all ain't experience shit
Yeah, I grabbed the Grammy I'm holdin one
Got plenty stripes, way more than some
Hush your mouthpiece hold your tongue
No obstacle could ever slow my run
When it come to rappin I'm the coldest one
Put my hand in the air and I froze the sun
Platinum plaque and not a golden one
Then I look at y'all like, "I told ya, uhh!"
Been a boss, when them cars
pull up I bet you that men'll pause
Yeah men-o-pause like women drawers
I bet ya I'll show you how to kill that noise
Phantom of the Opera passin by ya copper
in the new Phantom, phantom is a dropper
Cash I got a lot, ya mad cause you are not 
the talk up in the streets and mad cause you are not, uhh
They say it's got to be street - they say it's got to be street
They say it's got to be street - don't go commercial Koopa
it's got to be street
The major label ain't the only thing +Universal+ about me
Come back to the streets (uhh) come back to the streets
Them gimmick rappers they focus, most of these jokers is jokers
But I don't even play poker, pullin down your cheesy lookin posters
They look up to me like a bird, I look down on them like the curb
My movement lookin like it's movin, your movement look like a ERRRT!

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire]
Yeah, yeah
Life I live is just like a movie
I'm a corporation they tryin to sue me
Phony people be tryin to glue me
to they side and try stick it to me
Lucky for me that I got the toolie
Not Black & Decker but it's black I'll bet ya
Stay in the streets, do that for pleasure
So much paper they ask to measure
When the ruler of stackin moolah is speakin to ya don't interrupt
Middle finger up on the ceilin, somebody gon' eff you up
Don't let the black tux fool you cause I am not the one
I come out the suit like, Clark Kent to make sure you're done
Rappers ain't real rappers, they fakers and fronters
They Caucasian in the winter then turn Jamaican in the summer
Flippin with pimp man that straw in ya 
you know they ain't just some gunners
Personal trainers that'll bring a couple thangs and make you a +Runner+
Kinda like the producers that made this track (track)
We producin some major stacks (stacks)
And you losers need to face the facts
Put up your deuces the ace is back
Take out the rappers you think are wack
Put Chamillitary in place of that
Watch I'ma race in and take the plaques
then I unloosen a case of BLAP, BLAP!
