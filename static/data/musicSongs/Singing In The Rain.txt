Lyrics:


[Simple Plan & R. City:]
Iâm reading through the Sunday paper and itâs all bad news
(All bad news)
Iâm looking for a smile on the streets but itâs just no use
(Just no use)
Sing with me nowâ¦
Singing in the rain up, in the rain up
Singing in the rain up, in the rain up

I jump into my car, turn the key, but it just wonât start
(No, it just won't start)
I got a text from my ex, itâs official she just broke my heart
(She just broke my heart, oh)

[Simple Plan:]
Storm clouds are circling around
But I wonât let that shit drag me down

[Simple Plan & R. City:]
So Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing in the rain (Singing in the rain)

So Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing in the rain (Singing in the rain)

Iâve got a song in my heart and Iâm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
Thereâs nothing in the world thatâs gonna kill this mood (C'mon!)
No matter what life wants to throw my way
Iâll be singing, Iâll be singing in the rain
Singing in the rain up, in the rain up
Singing in the rain up, in the rain up

I went to see a fortune teller and she said Iâm doomed
Oh, no, no, no, no!
But what the hell does she know
Why she trying to break my groove
Now why she has to break my groove?

All of lifeâs colors turn to gray
Then you turn around and you smile my way
Suddenly all my problems disappear on cue
(All because of you)

[Simple Plan:]
Storm clouds are circling around
But I wonât let that shit drag me down

[Simple Plan & R. City:]
So Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing in the rain (Singing in the rain)

So Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing in the rain (Singing in the rain)

Iâve got a song in my heart and Iâm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
Thereâs nothing in the world thatâs gonna kill this mood (C'mon!)
No matter what life wants to throw my way
Iâll be singing, Iâll be singing in the rain
Singing in the rain up, in the rain up
Singing in the rain up, in the rain up

[R. City:]
Even when things shake, earthquake
No one can ever steal this smile
Even if they fail me
And see lately, it's been crazy
But it's okay, alright, see everything worths

And we living life in the fast lane
No matter what, I'ma won't change
Rock City, not pretty
Tell them what, I'ma not stop playing
Are you feeling good, feeling great?
No matter what, I won't see me break
In a rain singing this tune
Cause life is what I appreciate

[Simple Plan:]
Storm clouds are circling around
But I wonât let that shit drag me down
No no, no no, no no, nooo

[Simple Plan & R. City:]
So Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing in the rain (Singing in the rain)

So Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing (Iâll be singing)
Iâll be singing in the rain (Singing in the rain)

Iâve got a song in my heart and Iâm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
Thereâs nothing in the world thatâs gonna kill this mood (Kill this mood)
No matter what life wants to throw my way (Throw my way)
Iâll be singing, Iâll be singing in the rain
Singing in the rain up, in the rain up
Singing in the rain up, in the rain up
