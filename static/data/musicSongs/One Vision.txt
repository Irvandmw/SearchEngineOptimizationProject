Lyrics:


One man, one goal,
One mission.
One heart, one soul,
Just one solution.

One flash of light.
One god, one vision.

One flesh, one bone,
One true religion.
One voice, one hope,
One real decision.

Gimme one vision.

No wrong, no right.
I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white.
No blood, no stain.
All we need is one world-wide vision.

One flesh, one bone,
One true religion.
One race, one hope,
One real decision.

I had a dream when I was young,
A dream of sweet illusion:
A glimpse of hope and unity,
And visions of one sweet union.

But a cold wind blows,
And a dark rain falls,
And in my heart it shows.
Look what they've done to my dream.

One vision!

So give me your hands,
Give me your hearts.
I'm ready.
There's only one direction.
One world, one nation,
One vision.

No hate, no fight,
Just excitation.
All through the night
It's a celebration.

One.

One vision.

One flesh, one bone,
One true religion.
One voice, one hope,
One real decision.

Gimme one night.
Gimme one hope.
Just gimme.
One man, one man,
One bar, one night,
One day.
Just gimme gimme, gimme, gimme.
Fried chicken.
Vision.
