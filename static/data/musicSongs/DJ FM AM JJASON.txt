Lyrics:


I send you my love (Send you my love)
Around the clock (Don't stop)
Twenty-four seven, three hundred sixty-five

My DJ name DJ FM AM JJASON
I'm 365 days of fun
I'm grateful for my blessings on a daily basis
365 means no vacations
I'm infinite & endless, just like outer space is
A cousin to the planet's 7 billion faces
I spin around the sun
I go through moon phases
My calendar is busy 'cause I'm busy going places
Enjoying the ride in all its various stages
Enjoying this time before the season changes
My DJ name DJ FM AM JJASON
This music is my qualification

To send you my love (Send you my love)
Around the clock (Don't stop)
Twenty-four seven, three hundred sixty-five
I send you my love (Send you my love)
Around the clock (Don't stop)
Twenty-four seven, three hundred sixty-five (That's right, that's right)

My DJ name DJ FM AM JJASON
Like the Goddesses & Gods, I know my spirit is ancient
My game moves slow
At natural paces
Remembering to breathe is my meditation
My pen is my sword, I draw blood on these pages
I make love not war because peace is courageous
These beats are persuasive to raise our vibrations with love & appreciation
I ain't giving up this job to robotic automation
I take the music making my own radio station
My DJ name is just a fun abbreviation
This song is a dedication

To send you my love (Send you my love)
Around the clock (Don't stop)
Twenty-four seven, three hundred sixty-five
I send you my love (Send you my love)
All the time (Don't stop)
Twenty-four seven, three hundred sixty-five
(I like that)
(I, like, that)
(Do you like that?)
(I, like, that)

My DJ name DJ FM AM JJASON
I focus not on drama but on recreation
I'm planting new seeds for regeneration
Awakening dreams out of suspended animation
My resolutions renew because we change some
Every revolution is part of the equation
Multisyllabic sing-alongs are still my favorite
'Cause there's 99 digits & a comma just ain't one
We share the same DJ name 'cause it's famous
It's an acronym of calendar pages
From December to November we're in constant rotation
DJ FM AM JJASON

I send you my love (Send you my love)
Around the clock (Don't stop)
Twenty-four seven, three hundred sixty-five
To send you my love (Send you my love)
Around the clock (Don't stop)
Twenty-four seven, three hundred sixty-five
I send you my love (Send you my love)
All the time (Don't stop)
Twenty-four seven, three hundred sixty-five
I send you my love (Send you my love)
All the time (Don't stop)
Twenty-four seven, three hundred sixty-five
(Love & Appreciation)
