Lyrics:


You're a vision 
The perfect picture of an angel 
Sunlight shining on your face 
Through the window while you're sleeping 

My arms around you 
I feel your heartbeat and something strong, girl 
I'm gonna hold this moment 
I'll never let it go, yeah 

Like the look in your eyes on the day that we first met 
Walking on the beach, kissing as the sun sets 
Loving in the back seat, underneath the summer moon 

The weekend we spent down in New Orleans 
I gave you that ring while the rain was pouring 
I promised I'll spend the rest of my life with you 
Making memories 

Did I wake you? 
I didn't mean to, was I thinking out loud? 
The way you're smiling 
I know you know what I was thinking about 

So let's stay under the covers 
Just make love till we're out of strength 
Make another moment 
To remember for you and me 

Like the look in your eyes on the day that we first met 
Walking on the beach, kissing as the sun sets 
Loving in the back seat, underneath the summer moon 

The weekend we spent down in New Orleans 
I gave you that ring while the rain was pouring 
I promised I'll spend the rest of my life with you 
Oh, making memories, ooh, yeah 

I remember that weekend we spent down in New Orleans 
I gave you that ring while the rain was pouring 
I promised I'll spend the rest of my life with you 
Making memories, yeah 
You and me, making memories, making memories, yeah 

Like the day we met, kissing as the sun sets 
Making memories, making memories, ooh
