Lyrics:


This goes out to the most beautiful girl that I saw just the other day
She had me slipping and she had me falling for her right away
This goes out to the one and only miss mysterious
Thought of me being next to her got me so delirious
Yeah is she out is she out there
Yeah is she out there

Cause you're all that I need in every single way
Girl you got me love sick and your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt cause you never feel the same
Never been acquainted I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name

Before I saw your face
I never in my wildest dreams
Thought that true love was actually real
Cause you shine way brighter
Than anything I might have thought that I could feel
I give it all everything I have even though it's all so new
Cause I want you in the worst of ways
Can you make my wish come true
Is she out there is she out there
Just tell me if you're out there if you're out there

Cause you're all that I need in every single way
Girl you got me love sick and your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt cause you never feel the same
Never been acquainted I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name

Hey need to know your
Need to know your name
Hey hey
I need to...

Cause you're all that I need in every single way
Girl you got me love sick and your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt cause you never feel the same
Never been acquainted I just need to know your name
Cause you're all that I need (in every single way)
Girl you got me love sick and your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt cause you never feel the same
Never been acquainted I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name
