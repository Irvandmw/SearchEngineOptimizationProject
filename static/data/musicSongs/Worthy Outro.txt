Lyrics:


[Intro]
My mentor once told me, that fire cannot be denied
I'm 20 years old, and I've sacrificed the last four years of my life, to create music just for you
My social life. Stayin' in the studio, practicing, grinding. Just to give you, the soundtracks for your life
So I'm gonna continue to wake up every day and make good music, and get that recognition

[Hook]
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it

[Verse]
Yeah, now let me switch it up with some shit you ain't ever heard
Ain't drunk but the flow's slow
Everybody just relax and listen to my words [x2]
So many times have I designed a similar rhyme that came to mind, (inevitable)[?] to find the way I'm feelin' now
I'm feeling like I'm ready to blow, been waiting patiently but fuck it now I gotta go
When it comes to making this music it's nada yo, see you can't comprehend the amount of mind or heart I'm givin'
Hip-hops my show first, so you know I'm driven. Sunrise to sunset you know how I'm living
You see, I think it then write it, read it, repeat it then lace it, produce it then record it mix it then master it so the people adore it

[Hook]
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
