Lyrics:


It's a peaceful thing
To know that freedom as a rule belongs to me
There's something very wrong
When the colour of a man
Is all you see
After all this time
How can a single voice explain
Any reason for the pain we all have seen
It's not a dream

[Chorus:]
One man stood tall
And faced the devil with his back to the wall
And took one step
Closer to Heaven above

So he took a stand
And walked where no one else would dare to even try
It was the only way
If not for bravery
The soul would surely die
And right before my eyes he gave his life unselfishly
So that all the father's children could be free
Like you and me

[Chorus]

Bridge
Before his work is done
We've got to put an end to this game of
Choosing sides
I want us to be one
And I won't let it go
Till it's over
I'm here waiting

[Chorus]
