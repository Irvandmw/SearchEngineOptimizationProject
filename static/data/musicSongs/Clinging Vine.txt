Lyrics:


Cling to me clinging vine
Just to me clinging vine
How I wish those arms
You're clinging were mine
Please come back and cling
To me clinging vine.

I can't believe that we're through
That you're clinging to somebody new
Don't you know he'll never love you like I do
Please come back and cling to me clinging vine.

Cling to me clinging vine
Just to me clinging vine
How I wish those arms
You're clinging were mine
Please come back and cling
To me clinging vine.

Cling to me clinging vine
Just to me clinging vine
How I wish those arms
You're clinging were mine
Please come back and cling
To me clinging vine.

Please come back
And cling to me clinging vine...
