Lyrics:


[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin, back up.
She ain't yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.
[repeat]

[Bridge]
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick.
[repeat]

[Verse 1]
E-e-everybody know that face.
Even with her head low, they still know that shape.
When she come through the club people take they place.
Chicks throwin handcuffs
'cause they knowin they man ain't safe.

[Hook]
'cause she the one switchin up flows.
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go.
Chicks like, 'what kinda jeans is those?'
And fellas watchin like, 'please get low.'

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin, back up.
She ain't yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.
[repeat]

[Bridge]
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick.
[repeat]

[Verse 2]
E-e-everybody cant do this.
Some ain't gotta clue til they hear me spit.
Ah chu I spew 'cause yo girl is sick.
Is it the change or the hips you cant tell, but you know its thick.

[Hook]
'cause she the one switchin up flows.
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go.
Chicks like, 'what kinda jeans is those?'
And fellas watchin like, 'please get low.'

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin, back up.
She ain't yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.
[repeat]

[Bridge]
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick.
[repeat]

For this type of girl its not that hard.
You see her 'cause she's too far gone.
They only prayin, pray for her downfall.
Why they gotta be so envious?
Doin what it do fit to be a plus.
Hey [repeat 7x]

Back up [repeat 2x]

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin, back up.
She ain't yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.
Repeat

Hey [repeat 12x]

Back it up now.

Whoa [repeat 5x]
