Lyrics:


Take me away make it all better
If not for a day then maybe forever
Is it all in my head cause itâs getting harder
But thereâs something you said that I never thought of

Cause we are ordinary people beautiful as we are
We can still get lost, lost

Lost
Lost
We are lost
We are lost

Maybe today itâll get better
I hear what you say weâre in this together
Now Iâm starting to see
Hoping and praying
Weâll never win, win without playing

Cause we are ordinary people beautiful as we are
We can still get lost, lost

Lost
We still get lost
Itâs easy to get lost
We are lost
Itâs easy to get lost

We are ordinary people, we are lost
Ordinary people
We are ordinary people, we are lost
Lost
Lost
