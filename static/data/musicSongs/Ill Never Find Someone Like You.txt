Lyrics:


Ooh, I'll never find
I'll never find someone like you
Girl, you take my breath away
And when I'm with someone new
I rather be here with you, baby forever
Ooh, my heart belongs to you,
Girl I think about you all the time
I know in my love is true
When we're together
I played around girl and I made you cry
When I looked up you were saying goodbye
I'm beggin' you please, I need you so bad
Don't leave me now you're the best that I've had

I'll never
I'll never find someone like you (no, I'll never)
I promise it's true, no, I'll never
I'll never find someone like you (ooh baby)
Cuz I love the way that you are
And girl, I won't no I won't let you go
Noone could ever do, love you like I love you

All I have is just my heart and my feelings I give to you
That's all that I can do girl, baby forever
Ooh, you don't know that you're hurting me
Cuz it's not just a sexual thing
I wanna share my dreams, baby together
Girl I'm afraid just to give you the burn
My heart telling me to hold on to my love
But when you get close I want you to know
I start to get weak and I can't let you go

I'll never
I'll never find someone like you (no, I'll never)
I promise it's true
No I'll never (promise I'll never)
I'll never (promise I'll never) find someone like you
Oh baby
Cuz I love the way that you are
(The way that you are, hey baby)
And girl I won't, I won't let you go
No one could ever do, Love you like I love you

Just your smile (that's all I need)
Tenderness
Girl, I won't let you down
Girl, I will never find noone that compares to you
I'll never (ohh)
I'll never find someone like you
(I'll never, I'll never find someone like you, baby)
I promise it's true
(There's nobody like you baby, no no nobody)
I'll never find someone like you
(I'll never find somebody)
Cuz I love the way that you are
(The way that you are)
And girl I won't, I won't let you go
Cuz noone could ever do
And I promise to honnor you
I'll never (no way)
I'll never find someone like you
I'll never find someone like you
(Girl you're the only one)
I promise it's true
No, I'll never find someone like you
(I'll never find)
Cuz I love the way that you are
(The way that you are)
And girl I won't, I won't let you go
Cuz no one could ever do
I'll never find someone like you
