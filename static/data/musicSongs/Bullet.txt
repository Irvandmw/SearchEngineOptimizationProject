Lyrics:


My mama warned me about boys like you
Itâs the reason I wear these steel toed boots, yeah
And let me give you a little piece of advice
My papa packs heat and he wonât think twice, yeah

Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Too much trouble better stay away
Grab your hat, better get gone
But if you stay, youâve been warned

Iâm a bullet and Iâm headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
Iâm a bullet and Iâm headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Itâs gonna leave a mark!

Well, every now and then I make a man break a sweat
Watch him work overtime on my wristbands (yeah)
Cause Iâm the kinda girl that you wanna show off
Iâll tell âem all your friends with a southern drawl (yeah)

Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Sweet as a peach, impossible to tame
Fingers on the trigger and youâll be to blame
Cause if you stay

Iâm a bullet and Iâm headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
I'm a bullet and Iâm headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Itâs gonna leave a mark! (yeah)

Iâll ride where the wind wants to take me
Leaving lovers in the dust every city
'Cause my heart was like a ghost town baby
And now I've met a man that breaks me

(My mama warned me about boys like you
Itâs the reason I wear these steel toed boots)

Iâm a bullet and Iâm headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
I'm a bullet and Iâm headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Itâs gonna leave a mark!
Straight for you heart (yeah, yeah)
I'm a bullet and Iâm headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Itâs gonna leave a mark!
