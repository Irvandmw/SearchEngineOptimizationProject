Lyrics:


Come on up, you say
'Cause you can feel your love coming down
I find myself rushing over to
Do something for your love

I knock on the door
You answer, asking, what am I there for?
I say, I thought you wanted me to
Do something for your love

I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love

You call me up to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day
And could I come over today to
Do something for your love?

One knock gets me in
But then you say how very nice it's been
That lets me know that I will, once again
Get nothing from your love

I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love

You drop by to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day
And if I had some time later in the day
To do something for your love

Anyone else would say
No, that's okay, but maybe by now
She'll see things my way and ask me to stay
To do something for her love

I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
To get none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
You're being stingy with your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
I'm an all day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
Giving none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
To an all day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
To give none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
