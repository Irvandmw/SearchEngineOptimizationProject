[Intro Dembabies:]
[Monroe:]
Roe roe big girl
I got you mommy
[Giggles]

You make the beat
You make the beat go
You make the beat
You make the beat go

Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I'm for sure
It's forever
Talking 'bout Our love

Ooh-oooh-ooh-oooh

Got me lost in the clouds
Floating
Ooh-oooh-ooh-oooh
Keep me here always
We're the only thing that's true

Ooh-oooh-ooh-oooh

Beautiful, as the sun
Showers upon you baby

Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I'm for sure
It's forever
Talking 'bout Our love

We, communicate without saying the words aloud ([Monroe:] I got you mommy)
Heavenly, it's more than a state of mind
Now that you're in my life
And you...

Ooh-oooh-ooh-oooh

Beautiful as you make
All my tears dissipate, cause

Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I'm for sure
It's forever
Talking 'bout Our love

[Moroccan:]
You make the beat
You make the beat go
[Monroe:] I got you
[Moroccan:] mommy daddy
[Moroccan:] I love you mommy, I love you so much
[Monroe:] I got you

Beautiful as you make
All my tears dissipate

Cause our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I'm for sure
It's forever
Talking 'bout Our love

[Moroccan x3:]
You make the beat
You make the beat go

On and on and on and on now

Woah woah beat go
