Lyrics:


There was a time in history
I thought you were the enemy
You and I had a go between then
Harder than it's ever been
You told me when you went away
Standing in the summer rain
I'd never see your face again love
I'd never see your face

I've been alone longer than you
Gave it all for nothing like so many do
We got love between each other
All the air we can breathe
We can change it all my love
If we just believe

It's a brave new world and
You got to be a lover
When you finally get a part to play
When the rain starts falling
We turn to one another
It's your body and mine in the shape of things to come
Where does our love go
When the world is overrun?
God bless you and me
It's the shape of things to come

Time to grow strong
Seems your love is sailing by, oh
Time to turn the tide
Not like it was
Ain't nothing better than
The best of us

I've been alone longer than you
Gave it all for nothing like so many do
The love between each other
All the air we can breathe
We can change it all my love
If we just believe

It's a brave new world and
You got to be a lover
When you finally get a part to play
When the rain starts falling
We turn to one another
It's your body and mine in the shape of things to come
Where does our love go
When the world is overrun?
God bless you and me
It's the shape of things to come

And now I got you next to me
I'll tell you what you did to me
I nearly died of a broken heart
I nearly died of a broken heart
I've been alone all through the night
Gave it all for nothing with
Nothing to hide
Just believe in me girl
That's all I can say
I'm the one to steal your heart away

It's a brave new world and
You got to be a lover
When you finally get a part to play
When the rain starts falling
We turn to one another
It's your body and mine in the shape of things to come
Where does our love go
When the world is overrun?
God bless you and me, you and me
It's the shape of things to come

It's a brave new world and
You got to be a lover
When you finally get a part to play
When the rain starts falling
We turn to one another
It's your body and mine in the shape of things to come
Where does our love go
When the world is overrun?
God bless you and me
It's the shape of things to come
