Lyrics:


I don't know what I did to turn your eye
Is your claim to fame what you're putting down
After the first love, it was me or his black book
He's the boy for me

Does he share with me an oldfashioned love
Holding hands and cooing under the stars above
He asked me to wait
I've got to debate

He's the boy for me

I don't have no reason to believe you
You told me those same lies before
But I know that it's assured when I
When I see you standing at my front door
I will love you Baby

You're super-sensitive
So unreasonably so
Who broke your heart my love
Is what I'd like to know

It's not about the money
What I want is the honey

He's the Boy for me

I don't have no reason to believe you
You told me those same lies before
At last change your story Baby

But I know that it's assured when I
When I see you standing at my front door

You're super-sensitive
So unreasonably so
Who broke your heart my love
Is what I'd like to know
It's not about the money
What I want is the honey

Sweet Baby, you're the Boy for me
He's the Boy for me
