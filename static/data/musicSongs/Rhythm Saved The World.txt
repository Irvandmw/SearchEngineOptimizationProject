Lyrics:


Here's a lesson in history
At the battle of Bunker Hill
All the men one died until
The drumn' fife brought men new life
And rhythm saved the world

And in France not long ago
All the boys were feeling low
Drummer man struck up the band
And rhythm saved the world

You'll find music where ever history's concerned
Nero fiddled while Rome was being burnt

If the truth you're looking for
You'll find music not far
Drum'n fife gave men new life
Drummer man's struck up the band
Trumpet blow be Jericho
And rhythm saved the world
