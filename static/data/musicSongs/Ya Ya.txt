Lyrics:


Well, I'm sittin' in the la la
Waitin' for my ya ya, ah ha
I'm sittin' in the la la
Waitin' for the ya ya, ah ha

It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin', no, no

Hey, baby, hurry
Don't make me worry, no
Hey, baby, hurry
Don't make me worry, ah, ah, ah

You know that I love you
Yes, I love you, ah, ah
Uh

Well, I'm sittin' in the la la
Waitin' for my ya ya, ah ha
I'm sittin' in the la la
Waitin' for the ya ya, ah, ah, ah

It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin', no, no
Uh, now, one time, oh

Hey, baby, hurry
Don't make me worry, no, no
Hey, baby, hurry
Don't make me worry, no, no

You know that I love you
Always thinkin' of you, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, rock
