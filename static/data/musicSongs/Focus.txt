Lyrics:


[Bazzi:]
Slide with me, ride with me, get high with me
Know that I like it when you're next to me
Especially like sexually
'Cause you know that I'm fuckin' with you heavily
Your energy is heavenly
Don't spend a second trippin' on my enemies
'Cause they envy me and my energy
You know what I'm focused on

I'm feeling like a star
And if you think it, then you are
Put the focus back on me
Cut out negativity
Now I fuckin' live my dreams
Whatever I imagine
I know that shit can happen
Yeah, my energy on dragon
Burn it down and I start laughin'
Turn the ashes into magic, yeah, yeah

Take another hit, I'm in the sky
Nothing takes me higher than my mind
Ask about the shit, I'll let you know
Yeah, this the type of shit that free your soul

Slide with me, ride with me, get high with me
Know that I like it when you're next to me
Especially like sexually
'Cause you know that I'm fuckin' with you heavily
Your energy is heavenly
Don't spend a second trippin' on my enemies
'Cause they envy me and my energy
You know what I'm focused on

[21 Savage:]
Middle finger to the other side, they hate on me (Facts)
They know it wouldn't be wise for them to play with me (I be strapped)
Ridin' through my hood, I got your bae with me (21, 21)
I took her on a date, I brought my K with me (On God)
Say she like my vibe, way I slide, way I ride (Skrrt)
You got one main bitch, nigga, I got five (On God)
They know not to argue with me, I be way too high (21)
She top me while I'm driving, now I'ma get a DUI (21)

[Bazzi (21 Savage):]
Slide with me (Slide), ride with me (Ride), get high with me (High)
Know that I like it when you're next to me (Straight up)
Especially (Straight up) like sexually (On God)
'Cause you know that I'm fuckin' with you heavily (I am)
Your energy (Yeah) is heavenly (On God)
Don't spend a second trippin' on my enemies (21)
'Cause they envy me (21) and my energy (21)
You know what I'm focused on
