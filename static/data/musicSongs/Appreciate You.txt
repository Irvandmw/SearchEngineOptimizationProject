Lyrics:


Do we all need to be loved
A human need to be loved
There's no gift I can buy
I can make you feel that kinda high
That lifts your heart

Said we all want to feel special
Truly, deeply special
There's no words I can say
That will deeply, truly compensate
So here's where I start

Just want you to know that I appreciate you
I don't always show it but I swear that it's true
Said I love the beautiful things I know that you do
Just want you to know that I appreciate you

I recognize your strength
You confident style and grace
Oh, darling without you near
I'd be a mess right now, it's clear
So clear, so clear

So I want you to know that I appreciate you
I don't always show it but I swear that it's true
Said I love the beautiful things I know that you do
Just want you to know that I appreciate you

Tomorrow nobody knows
What may not come or go
Just in case we divide on this windy road
I need you to know

Said I need you to know that I appreciate you
I don't always show it but I swear that it's true
I love, love, love the beautiful things I know that you do
Just want you to know that I appreciate you

Said I do, I do, I do
And I do, I do, I do
No matter where I go or what I do
Don't matter, I'll appreciate you
