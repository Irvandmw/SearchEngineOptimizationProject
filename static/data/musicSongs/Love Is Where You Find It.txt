Lyrics:


Love is where you find it
On the city streets, wherever people meet, anywhere you go
When you find it you will know, woh, woh

Love is where you find it
In a dim cafe, a secret hideaway, it can come to you
And it's just a step away, woh, woh

And you know when you find it
Your heart will tell you that it's so, woh
And you know when you find it
That you'll never let her go

Walkin' in the rain, love can find you
Life won't be the same, when it finds you
And when it's had it's start
You'll never want to be apart

Love is where you find it
Maybe not today, but love will find a way, if you want it to
Love will come to you, woh, woh

And you know when you find it
Your heart will tell you that it's so, woh
And you know when you find it
That you'll never let her go

Love is where you find it
Maybe not today, but love will find a way, if you want it to
Love will come to you, woh, woh
