Lyrics:


She said she loves another
Said she loves another man
Ooh, and she says she wants to see him
Says she wants to see him again
She says "He looks at me with love
Every time with eyes that you have"
I said I know the man you're talking about
He's not coming back

'Cause I will never be how you remember me
No I will never be how you remember me
If you can only see the man I have come to be
'Cause I will never be how you remember me

I saw you from the mirror staring at a photograph
Ooh there's something about that moment, always seems to make you laugh
Now I know that I joke a little less than I did
Seen some things in life that I just cannot forget
We cannot move forward if you're stuck in the past
(Darling come back)

'Cause I will never be how you remember me
No I will never be how you remember me
If you can only see the man I have come to be
'Cause I will never be how you remember me

If you can only see
If you can only see
What I've come to be
If you can only see
If you can only see
What I've come to be

On your heart it isn't easy
And I'm sorry if this version of you [?]
If I'm changing then I'm changing for a reason
I need to survive
([?])

And it's not what you expected
But it leaves my life for you, it's still protected
You're the only one that I have not rejected
But I'll never be the way you remember me
