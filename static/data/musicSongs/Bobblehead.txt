Lyrics:


When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

Girls like you give girls a bad name
Trying to get a boy but you sound so lame
Thinking it's cute to act real dumb
But the jokes on you, you're stupid hon

Hold up, hold up, you're making no sense
You're talking out your ass
Like a bobblehead, you bobblehead
Just keep your trap shut like your mamma said

Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

But wait like, I don't get it

He, he, ha I don't care what you looking at
Body so skinny but your head's so fat
Talky, talky, talky but you don't say shit
Got a way with words, you give me nothing, bitch

Banging on the door, nobody else there
You're nightmare on Elm Street got everybody scared
Make me wanna run when you coming around
Because it's a frightening sound

Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

But wait, like, like what like, like what?
I don't get it, like what, what really?

Hanging with the girls makes you feel unsure
So you hang with the boys, makes you feel secure
Act all catty âcuz you hate competition
Rather like a sheep on your airhead mission

Laugh in you face but behind your back
They say "I kinda like her booty but the girl is whack"
You see the boys, the boys they love me
Think you're a pain in your butt? Know what? You're crazy.

Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah wah

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...

And the real girls say I never play dumb
To get what I want
And always come out the one
That's on top

I never play dumb
To get what I want
And always come out the one
That's on top

I never play dumb
To get what I want
And always come out the one
That's on top

I never play dumb
To get what I want
And always come out the one
That's on top

I donât get it
