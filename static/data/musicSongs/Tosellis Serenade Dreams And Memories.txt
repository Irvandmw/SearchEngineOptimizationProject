Lyrics:


Dreams and memories, 
Are all that you've left me, 
Only lonely thoughts, 
About the one I worship and adore! 

Dreams and memories, 
Are what I must live with, 
Sad remembering, 
Of golden moments that exist no more! 

Lovin' arms to hold me tight, 
And your lips to kiss goodnight, 
A love that seemed "Oh so right!" 
And yet, somehow, went wrong! 

Dreams and memories, 
The moonlight on your hair, 
Songs that we sang, 
That feeling we shared whenever a church bell rang! 

Oh, the memories and dreams of you! 

I can't live without you... 
I'll keep on praying you come back to me, 
To me... to me!
