Lyrics:


I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
And just the thought of you
Can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad

Just one night of moonlight
With you there beside me
All night,
Doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Ooh I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I wanna be with you
In spite of that my heart says
I guess I want you too bad

All I want is moonlight
With you there inside me
All night, oh baby
Doing it again and then again and then again and then again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Ooh I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
Ooh boy you're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I want to feel
Your heart and soul inside of me
Let's make a deal
You roll, I lick
And we can go flying into ecstasy
Oh darlin' you and me
Light my fire
Blow my flame
Take me, take me, take me away

All I really want is moonlight
With you there inside me
All night,
Doing it again and then again and then again and then again
Ooh baby, I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Ooh I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You know you're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Ooh I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky, touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You know you're making me high
You know you're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby
