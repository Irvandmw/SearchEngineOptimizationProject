Lyrics:


Made of clay
Shoot me down
Iâll ricochet to the ground
Words of paint
Draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know itâs over before itâs begun

I lost my way 
So help me out
And lend your hand âtil I am found
My voice is mute
Not to be heard
So itâs up to you
For you to bring those words

I
And I 
Have come undone
For the last time

This grief you give
It takes itâs toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree
Whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones, oh

I 
And I 
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time

I 
And I 
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time
