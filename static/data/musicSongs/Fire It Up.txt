Lyrics:


[Chorus:]
I've got a bad case of turning it up
It's getting cold in here so fire it up
I've got a bad case of turning it up
It's getting cold in here so somebody fire it up
Come on and fire it up

I'm in love with the feeling
Of pressure to the ceiling
We come with intention
To face my opposition
Get raw when it's time
To lay it on the line
To the walls where we're taking it
Let your light shine, like

Let your light shine, like
Let your light shine

[Chorus]

[Bridge (x2):]
Take it higher, take it higher
Til the roof is on fire
Take it higher, take it higher
Let's burn it up

We throw down
When it's time for the action
Make it happen, and the sound
That you're feeling like lead
Might just happen
When you're torn
You might not
Get a warning or a sign
To the walls where we're taking it
Let your light shine, like

[Chorus]

Come on and fire it up [x2]
