Lyrics:


Nothin's gonna harm you, not while I'm around! 
Nothin's gonna harm you, "No Sir!" 
Not while I'm around! 

Demons are prowling everywhere, nowadays, 
I'll send then howling, I don't care, 
I got ways! 

No one's gonna hurt you, no one's gonna dare! 
Others can desert you, not to worry, whistle, 
I'll be there! 

Demons will charm you with a smile, for a while, 
But in time, nothin' can harm you, 
Not while I'm around! 

Demons will charm you with a smile, for a while, 
But in time, nothin's gonna harm you, 
Not while I'm around! 
Not while I'm around!
