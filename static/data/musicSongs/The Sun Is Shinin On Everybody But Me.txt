Lyrics:


The sun is shinin' but it's rainin' all over my face
Tricklin' teardrops and I feel out of place
'Cause everybody's happy-go-lucky, it's easy to see
The sun is shinin' on everybody but me

It's been rainin' like this ever since you been gone
And every day I'm bluer than the day before
And if the rain don't stop I can't say
What's gonna become of me because
Every day I miss you a little bit more

The sun is shinin' but it's rainin' all over my face
Tricklin' teardrops and I feel out of place
'Cause everybody's happy-go-lucky, it's easy to see
The sun is shinin' on everybody but me

Somebody asked me were you worthy of a date
I made some excuse and politely slipped away
Because they know as much as I do
When it comes to knowing you
That this time I'm afraid you gotta say

The sun is shinin' but it's rainin' all over the place
Tricklin' teardrops and I feel out of place
'Cause everybody's happy-go-lucky, it's easy to see
The sun is shinin' on everybody but me

The sun is shinin' on everybody but me
