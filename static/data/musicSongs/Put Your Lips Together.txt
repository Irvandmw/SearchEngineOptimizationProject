Lyrics:


You know how to whistle, donât ya?
Just put your lips together
(Just put your lips together)
And blow (and blow)

You can be a princess
Put you in a party dress
You can make your smile wide
You can party up all night

And you can take your jazz galore
I ainât gonâ let them know 
You strike me as the type of guy
who doesnât know what heâs looking for
You said youâre a gangster
And that the whole worldâs against ya
I can be your liaison to all things fun

If you wanna win
Let me in, let me in
Everybody knows Iâm a lucky nice lucky one
If you want me back
Just put your lips together and blow

You know how to whistle, donât ya?
Just blow
Just blow

You know how to whistle, donât ya?
You know whoâs the most fun, donât ya?
Itâs me baby
Just put your lips together and blow

I can be a dirty bitch, bitch
I can be your only wish
Donât you think itâs time to switch
Switch it up, baby please
Cause if youâre doing the same thing youâll get the same thing
Donât you want better?
You was a smart boy
Donât you want heaven?
Donât you want heaven here on earth?

If you wanna win
Let me in, let me in
If you want me back
All you have to do is sin
Put your lips together
Put your lips together
You know how to whistle, donât ya?
Put your lips together, wonât ya?
And blowâ¦
And blowâ¦

You know how to whistle, donât ya?
You know whoâs the most, fun donât ya?
Itâs me baby
Put your lips together
Put your lips together

Ha ha, donât stop
Just know I want one
You baby, you baby
Ah ah, oh oh
Club hot hot, donât stop stop stop
Itâs all I really want
Itâs all I really want
Itâs you
You

You know how to whistle donât ya?
You know whoâs the most fun donât ya?
Donât ya know baby?
Just put your lips together and blow

If you wanna win
Let me in, let me in
If you want me back
All you have to do is sin
Put your lips together and blow
Let me in

If you wanna win
Let me in, let me in
