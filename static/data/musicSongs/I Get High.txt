Lyrics:


Woke up this mornin'
Lookin' there over the dawn of light
Things now for me are not what they used to be
I had many a friend
I had many a friend up until the end
But now everyone's gone and I'll live on
In a family

Yeah, sister girl
Yeah, yeah she do
Sister girl
Sure do, yeah
Sister girl
Yeah
Sister girl

Oh, yeah
Now everyone knows
They know the way, the way that it goes
It's like girl lock it up
Go on and ra-raise a family
That's what they tell me
They tell me, they tell me
I may not be fit, no
But I ain't no, I ain't nobody's hypocrite, yeah
If I find me a good reason, it would be so, so good, pleasin'

Yeah, sister girl
Yeah, yeah she do
Sister girl
Sure do, yeah
Sister girl
Yeah
Sister girl

Lord help me now
Yeah

Sister girl

Sister girl

Sister girl, uh

I woke up this mornin'
Lookin' there over the dawn of light
And things now for me are not what they used to be, yeah
I had many friends
Many friends up until the end
Oh, but everyone's gone and I'll live on
In a family
