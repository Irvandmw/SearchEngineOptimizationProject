Lyrics:


There's a few more churches than there are bars
A hell of a lot more trucks than there are cars
If the sun still hangin' in the sky
Work day still ain't done
Where I come from

You bow your head and pray before you eat
There ain't a single stranger on the street
There's a lot of nowhere towns out there
But for me there's only one
Where I come from

So if I just won't turn down, on a Saturday night
And if I never learn how, back down from a fight
And if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes
And if I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my, where I come from coming out

When I shake your hand I'mma look you in the eye
And if I'm wrong, I'll apologize
I'm still trying to live by, couple things that I've picked up
Where I come from

So if I like my music just a little too loud
And I got a couple tattoos to show my Georgia proud
And if what's on my mind is what's coming out my mouth
And if I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my, where I come from coming out

Got a lot of good, got a little bit of bad from you
Maybe what I am got everything I have from ya

So if I just won't turn down, on a Saturday night
And if I never learn how, back down from a fight
And if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes
And if I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my, where I come from coming out
Where I come from coming out
