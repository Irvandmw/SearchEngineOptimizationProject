Lyrics:


You and I
In a field
Full of stars

We can hide
From the world
If we want

All I need
Is your hand
And your heart

Let's be free
Run away
From it all

[2x]
Just you and I...

Here we are
Face to face
One more time

In the light
In the dark
We will shine

There's nobody watching, we're alone-lone-lone
Take all of your worries, let them go, let them go
I'll bring you to a place that only we know tonight

[3x]
Just you and I...

Here we are
In a field
Full of stars

We can hide
From the world
If we want

[5x]
Just you and I...

[2x]
Oh, we go higher baby...
