Lyrics:


[Verse]
Donât act so surprised, we knew from the beginning
Your love is a prize and I just wanna win it
Something bout your soul, the way you seem to know when Iâm feelin low
Hit me with the never let go
Everybody know you took it to the limit
Sometimes I wanna take the world, Iâm up you up in it
And the other guys donât know what they need
But I know you would be enough for me

[Chorus]
You know that itâs the truth as Iâm telling yourself
Girl if you want a lie, I got plenty of those
So when I lose you one, I need to stand to grieve
âCause when it comes to love I wear my heart on my sleeve
When Iâm with my friends Iâm having port or a show
Just say you wanna ride and Iâm ready to go
âCause when it comes to me you always get what you see
And when it comes to you I wear my heart on my sleeve

[Bridge]
Itâs alright, you can have your doubts
Just give it time, we can work it out
To be the one thatâs by your side
You know that Iâd be right

[Verse]
Even though we fight every other minute
We fall out of love and we be right back in it
âCause playing on your mind, I wonât let it go
I just wanna know that you feel the same as I
Everybody knows I live it like I talk it
If I said I roll then you know Iâm gonna walk it
Never playin you, baby donât you see?
That itâs never been the game for me

[Interlude]
So why? (so why?)
Youâre mine (youâre mine)
Iâm living on a hot away but I feel it
And thatâs why I book my heart where you see it
Know why (know why)
Canât hide (canât hide)
Wishing youâll only get the best of luck
Baby that is all I got

[Chorus]
You know that itâs the truth as Iâm telling yourself
Girl if you want a lie, I got plenty of those
So when I lose you one, I need to stand to grieve
âCause when it comes to love I wear my heart on my sleeve
When Iâm with my friends Iâm having port or a show
Just say you wanna ride and Iâm ready to go
âCause when it comes to me you always get what you see
And when it comes to you I wear my heart on my sleeve

[Bridge]
Itâs alright, you can have your doubts
Just give it time, we can work it out
To be the one thatâs by your side
You know that Iâd be right

[Verse]
Hoping that youâll see eventually
You and I were always meant to be
No one else could mess with us
Every girl in the world follow me in love
Tell them just keep off the lie
Maybe in another life
Youâre everything Iâd ever need
You donât even have to try

[Chorus]
You know that itâs the truth as Iâm telling yourself
Girl if you want a lie, I got plenty of those
So when I lose you one, I need to stand to grieve
âCause when it comes to love I wear my heart on my sleeve
When Iâm with my friends Iâm having port or a show
Just say you wanna ride and Iâm ready to go
âCause when it comes to me you always get what you see
And when it comes to you I wear my heart on my sleeve

[Bridge x2]
Itâs alright, you can have your doubts
Just give it time, we can work it out
To be the one thatâs by your side
You know that Iâd be right
