Lyrics:


It's a whistling kinda morning
It's a whistling kinda day
It's a grooviest tooliest julious day to say
Not a cloud in sight
The sun's just right
The world's a bright bouquet
It's a wonderful kinda whistling kinda morning

Oh life is sweet as sweet as people make it
So treat your tweet and hear the robin say OK
Get a happy blokey feeling
Come live it up while you may
It's the dilliest dalliest palsiest day today

It's a wonderful kinda whistling kinda morning
Oh what a morning
Oh what a morning
It's a wonderful kinda whistling kinda day
