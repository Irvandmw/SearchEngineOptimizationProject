Lyrics:


You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
You bring me down
You shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
You don't believe me

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady... stay sweet

You say
You call me up and feed me all the lines
You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese
Waiting on the shelf
You eat me up
You hold me down
I'm just a fool to make you a home

Ooh you really do
And you say
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady... stay sweet

My sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet baby
Believe and we've got everything we need

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady... stay sweet

Runaway come on
Yeah yeah

Sweet lady
