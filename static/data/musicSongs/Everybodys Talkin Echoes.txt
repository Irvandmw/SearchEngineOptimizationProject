Lyrics:


Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

People stoppin', starin'
I can't see the faces
Only the shadows of the eyes

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear the word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

And I won't let you leave my love behind
No, baby, I won't let you leave my love behind
And I won't let you leave my love behind
