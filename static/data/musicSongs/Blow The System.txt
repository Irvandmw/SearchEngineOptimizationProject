Lyrics:


[Verse 1:]
Play or not play it to me
Drop the beat make it hard to move me
Don't waste my time you lose me
Let's go
Come close take me on a journey
On the main light streets you know me
It's about that time to show me

[Pre-Chorus:]
I just want what's mine
Make me come alive
Let's go for a ride
You know the time is right
Let's take the morning flight
Let's reach for the sky
Higher [x7]

[Chorus:]
Blow The
I've got that burning fever
On the dance floor where I need my 
Turn it up 
And bump the speaker the volumes way too low
Just keep up with the rhythm 
Let lose I'll
Blow The System [x2]
Come on now here we go

[Verse 2:]
Shhhh quit talking to me
Imma boss gotta rush it to me
Want the baseline flowing through me 
Come close take me on a journey
On the main light streets you know me
It's about that time to show me

[Pre-Chorus:]
I just want what's mine
Make me come alive
Let's go for a ride
You know the time is right
Let's take the morning flight
Let's reach for the sky
Higher [x7]

[Chorus:]
Blow The
I've got that burning fever
On the dance floor where I need my 
Turn it up 
And bump the speaker the volumes way too low
Just keep up with the rhythm 
Let lose I'll
Blow The System [x2]
Come on now here we go

Oh way oh

[Verse 3:]
Feel the pressure rush
Let's tear the house down
Turn the up sound
Get the dice then roll em out
And when you've had enough
I'll make it louder [x7]
NO!

[Chorus:]
I've got that burning fever
On the dance floor where I need my 
Turn it up 
And bump the speaker the volumes way too low
Just keep up with the rhythm 
Let lose I'll
Blow The System [x2]
Come on now here we go

Oh way oh 
Uh!
