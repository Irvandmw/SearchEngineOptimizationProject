Lyrics:


[Amanda Seyfried & Meghan Fox:]
You're killing people
No, I'm killing boys
Boys are just placeholders, they come and they go
You're my best friend, and I wanna help you, but I won't let you kill again, that's a lose-lose

[Halsey:]
Told me pick my battles and be picking 'em wise
But I wanna pick 'em all and I don't want to decide
No more, no more, anymore
So we'll sneak in the back
And then we'll kick in the door
Tell me have you ever keyed a Ferrari before?
Oh no, oh I don't anymore

And I'm not breaking, I won't take it
And I won't ever feel this way again
'Cause you don't need me anymore, ooh whoa
And I won't ever try again
And all I want in return is revenge
Cause I don't need you anymore, ooh whoa
So where do you go?

Pull up to the drive and I remember the codes
Yeah, the only fucking numbers you don't hide in your phone
No more, no more, anymore
Climb up to the window and I'm breaking the glass
Then I stop 'cause I don't wanna Uma Thurman your ass
No more, no more, anymore

And I'm not breaking, I won't take it
And I won't ever feel this way again
'Cause you don't need me anymore, ooh whoa
And I won't ever try again
And all I want in return is revenge
'Cause I don't need you anymore, ooh whoa
So where do you go?

When I don't need you anymore
And I don't need you
