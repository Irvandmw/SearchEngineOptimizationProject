Lyrics:


We have to love him now
While he is still here
For all that, all that he's done
Before the morning disappears

We, we, we, can still hug him now
After all these years
'Cause when the darkness comes
When the darkness comes
He's our chandelier

To bring the light
To bring the light, yeah
I'm sorry if this is a bore
But I wasn't sitting in here before
So I toast him tonight

When your trajectory was off
And you couldn't find true north, just lost
He would say, protect him at all cost
Then he would hang up the call

But we, we can still hug him now
After all these years
'Cause when the darkness comes
When the darkness comes
He's our chandelier

To bring the light, ay
To bring the light, yeah
I'm sorry if this is a bore
But I wasn't sitting in here before
So I toast him tonight

'Cause when the darkness comes
And you know it'll come
You know it'll come
But when it does
Just know he's our chandelier

Oh, to bring the light, ay
To bring the light, yeah
I'm sorry if this is a bore
But I wasn't sitting in here before
So I toast him tonight
