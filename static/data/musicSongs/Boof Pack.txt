Lyrics:


Smokin' boof pack
I just dropped the roof back (skrr skrr)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu at (In the crib, ay)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that
(We gon' shoot that)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ay
(Bought that coupe, ay)
Smokin' boof pack
I just dropped the roof back (skrr skrr)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu, ay (In the crib, ay)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that (boom boom)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ay
(Bought that coupe, ay)

I drop the roof back
Young nigga flexin' how we do it, ay (how we do it)
Bitches love a nigga but it's cool cause I've been doin' things
And you niggas hoes, tryna act like you gon' shoot, ay (know you won't)
I been with the bros, sippin' lean, and we cool, ay (sippin' lean)
If we see you walkin' and we see some fits we takin' (yeah we takin')
I got Polo drop, and it's wrapped around my waist, yeah
Niggas switchin' up, got me askin' why you fake me
We just bought a crib, and we smokin' on it lately

Smokin' boof pack
I just dropped the roof back (skrr skrr)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu, ay (In the crib, ay)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that
(We gon' shoot that)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ay
(Bought that coupe, ay)
Smokin' boof pack
I ain't drop the roof back
In my own crib, when they ask me where the stu, ay
(In the crib, ay)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that (boom boom)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ay
(Bought that coupe, ay)

I'm too busy running up these bands
I'm with yo hoe and we don't hold no hands (lil bitch)
And I just dropped some lean, on my pants (dropped some lean)
And we just dropped the clip and made 'em dance (boom boom)
Bandkids love to ball' we always cash out (always cash out)
And I just finish the Wood, I'm bouta pass out (I'm bouta pass out)
And I just seen a lick, we bout to max out
Since a youngest, started flexing, find the cash route

Smokin' boof pack
I ain't drop the roof back (skrr skrr)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu, ay (In the crib, ay)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that (we gon' shoot that)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ay
(Bought that coupe, ay)
Smokin' boof pack
I ain't drop the roof back (skrr skrr)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu, ay (In the crib, ay)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that
(We gon' shoot that)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ay
(Bought that coupe, ay)
