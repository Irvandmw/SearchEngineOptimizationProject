Lyrics:


We've been sweatin' a whole life long just to get this right.
It's a work hard hit hard stuggle, its a sacrifice.

It's time to blow it up,
Time to lock and load,
Time to take the field,
Time to start the show.

This is our moment,
This is our time,
And we aint holdn' back,
Were laying it all on the line,
This is our destiny,
It's our night to shine,
This is our moment,
This is our time.

We've been playing guitars and bangin' drums since we ere boys,
Tryn to impress pretty girls with alotta noise.

It's time to turn it up,
Time to rock and roll,
Time to take the stage,
Time to start the show.

This is our moment
This is our time,
And we aint holdin' back,
Were laying it all on the line,
This is our destiny,
It's our night to shine,
This is our moment,
This is our time.

Its time to turn it up
Time to rock and roll,
Time to take the field,
Time to start the show.

This is our moment,
This is our time,
And we aint holdn' back,
Were laying it all on the line,
This is our destiny,
It's our night to shine,
This is our moment,
This is our time.
This is our moment,
This is our time.
