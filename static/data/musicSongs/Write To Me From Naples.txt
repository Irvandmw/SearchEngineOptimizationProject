Lyrics:
Lyrics:


[Choir:] 
I can hear a mandolino
Write to me from Naples
Write me every day
I love you and Naples
More than words can say
Call me Cara Mia
Tell me all that's new
Write to me from Naples
Keep my heart with you

[Choir:]
I can hear a mandolino
Softly entice
While I raise a glass of vino
Praising your eyes

Since we said Arrivederci
My poor heart cries
For a letter from you

Write to me from Naples
I love you and Naples
Call me Cara Mia
tell me all that's new
Write to me from Naples
Keep my heart with you
Keep my heart with you
