My love
My love
All night
I've been drunk and confused
All night
Wishin' I never made rules
All night
I'm so tired of bein' a fool
All night
What should I do?

I know I said what I said, but that ain't what I mean
I'll take you back, I'll take you back
I know I said I was done, but that ain't what I mean
But I'll take you back, I'll take you back
I'll take you back, back, back
I'll take you back (mmm, mmm, mmm)
I'll take you back, back, back, oh yeah
I'll take you back
Back, back, back, b-b-back, back, back, back, back, back
All night

Back, back, back, back
All night
Back, back, b-back, back, back
All night
Back, back, back, back
Take you back in the morning-ing-ing-ing
Back, back, b-back, back, back
All night

I know you wanna be some (be some)
I don't mind it, girl, I don't mind it (I don't mind it)
Girl, I never can deny you (deny you), I will never try to fight you (fight you)
Why try it, girl? I done tried it (all night)

Bottom line, line, line, bottom line
You're the finest, girl, you're the finest (all night)
Bottom line, line, line, bottom line, line
You're always mine, mine, mine, always mine

I know I said what I said, but that ain't what I mean
I'll take you back, I'll take you back
I know I said I was done, but that ain't what I mean
But I'll take you back, I'll take you back
I'll take you back, back, back
I'll take you back (mmm, mmm, mmm)
I'll take you back, back, back, oh yeah
I'll take you back
Back, back, back, b-b-back, back, back, back, back, back
All night

Wasn't tryna control you (control)
I'm just tryin' to feel your loyalty (your loyalty)
Never wanted to destroy you (destroy you)
I did everything because of you (because of you)
You can love me, girl, it's all you (all you)
You'll still be the one to fall through

Bottom line, line, line, bottom line (bottom line)
You're the finest, girl, you're the finest (all night)
Bottom line, line, line, bottom line, line (bottom line)
You're always mine, mine, mine, always mine

I know I said what I said, but that ain't what I mean
I'll take you back, I'll take you back
I know I said I was done, but that ain't what I mean
But I'll take you back, I'll take you back
I'll take you back, back, back
I'll take you back (mmm, mmm, mmm)
I'll take you back, back, back, oh yeah
I'll take you back
Back, back, back, b-b-back, back, back, back, back, back
All night

Back, back, back, back
All night
Back, back, b-back, back, back
I'll take you
All night
Back, back, back, back
Take you back in the morning-ing-ing-ing
Back, back, b-back, back, back
All night

I was wrong
Now you're gone
I was wrong
Now you're gone
