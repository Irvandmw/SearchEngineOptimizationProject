Lyrics:


I thought I saw you in my head
Howâd you sleep away again?
Whereâd you go?
Whereâd you go?
I came so close so many times,
Even almost lost my mind, trying to find you, trying to find you.
How could this city feels so lonely?
Itâs hard to believe when people tell me
Donât give up when it all comes down
Only things that you lost are found
Just around the corner, just around the corner
When you donât think you can take no more
You might find what youâre searching for
Just around the corner, just around the corner
Itâs just around the corner, yeah.
Itâs just around the corner
If I knew where you are somehow, Iâd be running there right now
No matter how far, no matter how far
This would be easier if only
I could believe what people tell me
Donât give up when it all comes down
Only things that you lost are found
Just around the corner, just around the corner
When you donât think you can take no more
You might find what youâre searching for
Just around the corner
Itâs just around the corner, yeah.
Itâs just around the corner, yeah.
Just around the corner
I swear the stars look like they`re crying
Waiting for Love can feel like dying wow
Donât give up when it all comes down
Only things that you lost are found
Just around the corner, just around the corner
When you donât think you can take no more
You might find what youâre searching for
Just around the corner
Itâs just around the corner, yeah.
Just around the corner
Itâs just around the corner, yeah.
Just around the corner
Itâs just around the corner
