NickiHndrxx (Brrrt!)

Transformer, I just popped a Transformer
Lit the room up
All I did was hold my arm up
Went through Barneys
I spend 20k on Amiris
Got my weight up
Now I'm talking back to Siri
Trashin' foreign hoes
Murder shit at the coroner
Jackie Joyner
Racing red
I'll show 'em up
Woke the don up
All I did was hold my arm up
Top goin' up
In it like I lit the Sun up

Goin' bonkers
I fuck with her, I'm her sponsor
Carats dangling
Everything I do is expensive
Off the continent
Everything is out the country
No assumption
Hit on the gas
Start punchin'
Pardon my confâidence
Hit the gas barely functionin'
Ain't no conscience
'Bout to spaz on this stallion
Fuck a casualty
Everything we did was lavishly
Fuck a tragedy
All these sticks automatically

Transformer, I just popped a Transformer
Lit the room up
All I did was hold my arm up
Went through Barneys
I spend 20k on Amiris
Got my weight up
Now I'm talking back to Siri
Trashin' foreign hoes
Murder shit at the coroner
Jackie Joyner
Racing red
I'll show 'em up
Woke the don up
All I did was hold my arm up
Top goin' up
In it like I lit the Sun up

What the fuck?
I might have to pump breaks on these hoes
Real shooters I don't ever pump fake on these hoes
Me-me and Pluto pull up in that new
Ferrari drip
Always eating Japanese so I'm a need wasabi dick
F-f-four albums in, pull a Mili for a show
While these bitches is servin' Milli Vanilli on the low
Spend my money on some dope
With my money, I'm 'bout loc'
Transform into 3 Billy 'cause I'm really the GOAT

Transformer, I just popped a Transformer
Master bathroom, two jacuzzis in the sauna
They ain't warn her, now she out here facing karma
Had a chance but, God, that mean that she a goner
Where my bad bitches?
Fuck these niggas give them trauma
Could of fâixed his life, but now that nigga need the lyanla
All his friends tryna kill it, eat it, Jeffery Dahmer
Niggas snakes, but stupid I'm the snake charmer
This a different tax bracket, upper echelon
I'm still the bad guy, I am a Decepticon
Some call me Nicki, but some call me Megatron
I'm stopping bags and I don't need the red octagon

Transformer, I just popped a Transformer
Lit the room up
All I did was hold my arm up
Went through Barneys
I spend 20k on Amiris
Got my weight up
Now I'm talking back to Siri
Trashin' foreign hoes
Murder shit at the coroner
Jackie Joyner
Racing red
I'll show 'em up
Woke the don up
All I did was hold my arm up
Top goin' up
In it like I lit the Sun up

Don't carry, oh!
Nigga run the 'ravi
Run the town bitch, oh!
We just fucked a balance
Check my sadness, oh!
I take them to Palace
Tryin' to bag this, oh!
Is she from a pageant?
Fuck her daddy, oh!
'Cause she called me Zaddy
'Cause she called
'Cause she called me Zaddy
Check my sadness, oh!
