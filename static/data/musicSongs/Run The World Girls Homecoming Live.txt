Lyrics:


(Girls)
Coachella, thank you for allowing me to be the first
Black woman to headline Coachella
(Girls)
Ain't that 'bout a bitch?
(Girls)
This song is dedicated to all the incredible women
That opened up the doors for me
Thank you so much ladies
(Girls)
Do we have any strong women out there tonight?
Sing along

Girls, we run this mutha
Girls, we run this mutha
Girls, we run this mutha
Girls, we run this mutha, girls (Here we go)

Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run this mutha? Girls (Girls)
Who run this mutha? Girls (Girls)
Who run this mutha? Girls (Girls)
Who run this mutha? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)

Some of them men think they freak this
Like we do, but no they don't
Make your check, come at they neck
Disrespect us, not at all
This go back to all the girls
Up in the club rockin' the latest
Who will buy it for themselves and get more money later

I think I need a barber
None of these n****s can fade me
I'm so good with this, I remind you, I'm so hood with this
Boy, I'm just playing, come here baby
Hope you still like me, F-U, pay me

My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power, with our love we can devour
Do anything for me

Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run this mutha? Girls (Girls)
Who run this mutha? Girls (Girls)
Who run this mutha? Girls
Who run this mutha? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Girls)
Who run the world? Girls (Whoa)

(Who are we?) Who are we?
(What we run?) What we run?
(The world) Who run this mutha?
(Who are we?) Who are we?
(What we run?) What we run?
(The world) Who run this mutha?
Who are we?) Who are we?
(What do we run?) What do we run?
(We run the world) We run this mutha
(Who are we?)
(What we run?)
(We run the world)
(Who run the world? Girls)

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls, "You can have ambition
But not too much"
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
But for the attention of men
Feminist; a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes
