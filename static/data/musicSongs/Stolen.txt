'Mano

[Chris Brown:]
Feelin' like I was God
How did I get from too much to not a lot?
Who would've thought that you would give me a loss?
You take and you take, don't think about the cost (Hol' up)

You just snatch and grab things I can't get back
(That's what you did, but now)
I'm just trying to rack all that you subtract
Left me with the aftermath

I just wanna get back what you've stolen
Need it so I can be whole again
I need all of the pieces you're holdin'
Pieces of my heart that you've stolen

You took my sanity, I got no peace of mind
Overdrawn on my memory, bank can't buy back my time
But you tryna cap though, talkin' 'bout you layin' low
When you switch on niggas like you change clothes
But you want it that way, so what can I say? Yeah

You just snatch and grab things I can't get back
(Girl, that's what you do to me)
I'm just trying to rack (Ooh) all that you subtract
Left me with the aftermath

[Chris Brown {Young Thug}:]
I just wanna get back what you've stolen
Need it so I can be whole again
I need all of the pieces you're holdin' {Oh, baby}
Pieces of my heart that you've stolen (Stole)

[Chris Brown:]
Just wanna get back what you've stolen (Oh)
Pieces of my heart that you've stolen (Stole)
Oh, I just wanna get back
Just wanna get back what you stole (Stole)
(Just wanna get back, just wanna get back)

[Young Thug:]
Baby, I just
I just wanna get back everything
I got it, now we'll cop it (Ayy)
We was servin' thrax
I kept the shotty and the rocket (Bah, bah)
Fourth quarter, let's sack it
Let you claim the winning bucket
And I kill it when I'm fuckin' it (Woo)
You took my sanity
Then you threw it for grabs (You threw it for grabs)
Keep this shit real with me
I'll do the same back (Keep this shit one hundred, oh)
I started lovin' you
Not the first but the second time (Second time I saw you)
We ride the four-seater
Or the coupe with the hatchback, yeah

[Chris Brown:]
I just wanna get back what you've stolen
Need it so I can be whole again
I need all of the pieces you're holdin'
Pieces of my heart that you've stolen

Just wanna get back what you've stolen
Pieces of my heart that you've stolen
Oh, I just wanna get back
Just wanna get back what you stole

With all that petty shit, petty bitch
Stealin' change out the baby carseat
Her shoes five G, the purse thirty
Gotta take a Uber, got the boot on the lease
She a new Mona Lis', but her face change
I stayed dangerous, she see the beauty in the beast
Put her hand in your jeans, hear that bang-bang
Why you tryna steal my piece with my hand on my heat?
Bitches gang-gang
Now she comin' for my neck, tryin' to give me head, brain, brain
Shawty better flock a bitch, tryin' to steal my shit, mayday
She eyin' that watch on my wrist, little itty bitch, no tick-tock
Come sign this NDA, baby, huh (No, for real, ooh)

I just wanna get back what you've stolen
Need it so I can be whole again
I need all of the pieces you're holdin'
Pieces of my heart that you've stolen

Just wanna get back what you've stolen
Pieces of my heart that you've stolen
Oh, I just wanna get back
Just wanna get back what you stole
(Just wanna get back, yeah, yeah)
