Lyrics:


He was there when I started, in Knoxville, Tennessee
Opening for Patty Loveless, November of '93
Full of friends, mom, and uncle Butch
And the crowd was really small
He'd say I was a scared kid, if this bus could talk

Some nights we'd dance with the devil
Some nights we'd pray to the Lord
Between vibrant passes and margarita glasses
He was never really bored
We were starry eyed dreamers, bouncing off the wall
And all the stories he could tell, if this bus could talk

He'd seen pool halls in Texas
And every corndog county fair
Girls that we'd make cry, some crowds that didn't care
When Bobby rolled us down in 'Bama
He kept rocking through it all
All the stories he could tell
If this bus could talk

Late night conversations, full of drunk philosophy
On politics and religion, football and family
The lovers that we missed, and the lovers that we lost
All the secrets he could share, if this bus could talk

He'd seen Virginia Beach, caught in a hurricane
Heroes I wish I never met but he ain't naming names
We learned the code of the road at The Grizzly Rose
Then we had a ball
All the stories he could tell
If this bus could talk

Many years of summers, and I hope it never ends
Been down so many highways, full of twists and turns and bends
We caught lightning in a bottle, somehow we survived it all
All the stories he could tell, if this bus could talk

As I leave the stage, still high from your applause
He'd tell you that I love you
If this bus could talk
If this bus could talk
If this bus could talk
If this bus could talk
