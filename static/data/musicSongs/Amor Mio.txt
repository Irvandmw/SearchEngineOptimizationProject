Lyrics:


The warmth the grace that special face amor mio
A voice that sings the charm that clings amor mio
You see those eyes your heart sighs amor mio
You must agree that she's the perfect she

It's so easy to explain why the rainbows follow rain
But please tell me why
Why those rainbows still appear every time that she is near
Or nearly passin' by
I bless the day she came my way amor mio
The day divine that made my lover mine

(It's so easy to explain why the rainbows follow rain)
But please tell me why
Why those rainbows still appear every time that she is near
Nearly passin' by
I bless the day she came my way amor mio
The day divinethat made my lover mine
Amor mio amor mio amor mio
