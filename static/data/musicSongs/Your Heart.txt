KE on The Track

I need the sun to deliver me from all these thoughts of mine
When everything else seems grey, you see colors
When life just seems to fly past, you just hover ooh
I'd go through hell just to see you smile
And to see you happy makes it all worthwhile
I know this feeling is love
And you are an angel sent from above, oh

When I see your face, it takes my breath away
Another step to take
I wanna have your heart, your heart
I'm heading somewhere now, I'm leaving it up to fate
But that's just the risk I'll take
I wanna have your heart, your heart

For some time, I been holding this in 'cause I
Knew that a day would come when you and me would feel something undefined
And for a long time, I been here waiting on you
There's something amazing 'bout you
And I think you are an angel
So when I...

When I see your face, it takes my breath away (Yeah)
Another step to take (Another step to take)
I wanna have your heart (Your heart), your heart (Your heart)
I'm heading somewhere now (Yeah), I'm leaving it up to fate (I'm leaving it up to fate)
But that's just the risk I'll take (That's just the risk I'll take)
I wanna have your heart (Your heart), your heart (Your heart)

(Ooh, ooh)
I know you are the one
(Ooh)
I know you gave me something incredible
Just lay your head right on my chest
(Ooh)
And you'll be safe right here with me for life
(Ooh)
And I'll never let you go
Spend the rest of my time, just you and I
When I...

When I see your face, it takes my breath away
Another step to take (Yeah, another step to take)
I wanna have your heart (Ooh), your heart (Ooh)
I'm heading somewhere now (Yeah), I'm leaving it up to fate (I said I'm leaving it up)
But that's just the risk I'll take (That's just the risk I'll take)
I wanna have your heart, your heart
