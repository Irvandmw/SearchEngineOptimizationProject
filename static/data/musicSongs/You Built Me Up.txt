Lyrics:


Yesterday was all black
And I fell into despair
I fell into despair

The whole world was on my back
And my knees began to go
And my legs began to bow

But last night you built me up again
You made me feel that I could win
Last night you built me up again

Yesterday was all wrong
And I couldn't make it right
I could not make it right

But your bravery's like a lion's
Your reasoning myth-defying
You cut right through to the heart of it
You let me believe that I thought of it
Then despair was replaced by energy

Yesterday was all black
And I fell into despair
I fell into despair

But last night you built me up again
You made me feel that I could win
Last night you built me up again

Last night you built me up again
You made me feel that I could win
Last night you built me up again
