Lyrics:


One love, one love
Enrique Iglesias
Pitbull

I don't care if you're taken
Long as you're single I come around
I don't care for love making
I wanna beat it 'til your walls come down

I put the key in your ignition
Turn you on
So you revved up, ready to go
Now I can tell you what I'm thinking, if you want
But you already know, already know

I got three letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you
I've for three letters on my brain
I can't wait to put it on you

And have you like, whoa,
Make your body explode
I got three letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you

I don't care what you're wearing
Because it all looks good on a floor
I wanna see you standing
With nothing on but the heels you own

I put the key in your ignition
And turn you on
So you revved up, ready to go
Now I can tell you what I'm thinking, if you want
But you already know, already know

I got three letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you
I've for three letters on my brain
I can't wait to put it on you

And have you like, whoa,
Make your body explode
I got three letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you

[Pitbull]
If you see, you see I make it look easy,
But I will call for the money believe me.
Foreplay? For sure, tease me.
In EspaÃ±ol: "Si, si". In French: "Oui, oui". In English: "Yes, yes".
I give you best, best.
Dale locita rica and give me a kiss, kiss.
Nothing matters than the 3 letters I'm thinking,
What'd you except, S-E-X.
Then we can take it to the room and explode like kaboom.
Take it to the ladies bathroom like, oh.
Take it to the parking lot,
Backseat, beep beep, vroom vroom, make it hot.
You don't do this on the first night, lemme prove you're wrong.
You got a key to your ignition?
Let me turn you on.
You don't do this on the first night?
Aye mamita, of course you do.

I'm going down, going down, going down
'Cause baby you're sexy
So turn around, turn around, turn around
'Cause baby you're sexy

I got three letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you
I've for three letters on my brain
I can't wait to put it on you

And have you like, whoa,
Make your body explode
I got three letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you

I got three letters...
I got three letters...
