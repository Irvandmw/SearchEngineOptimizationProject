Lyrics:


Just walkin' in the rain
Gettin' soakin' wet
Don't you read my heart

Just walkin' in the rain
So alone and blue
All because my heart
Still remembers you

People
Come to windows
And they always stare at me
Shakin' their heads in sorrow
Sayin' "Who can that fool be"

Just walkin' in the rain
Thinkin' how we met
Knowin' things have changed
Somehow I can't forget

People
Come to windows
And they always stare at me
Shakin' their heads in sorrow
Sayin' "Who can that fool be"

Just walkin' in the rain
Thinkin' how we met
Knowin' things have changed
Somehow I can't forget
