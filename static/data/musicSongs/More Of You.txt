Lyrics:


I stare at you, sometimes at night
Wishing I could just press rewind
'Cause I just want more, I get confused
Sometimes my skin can't tell
Where yours stops and mine begins
In everything, and I just want more

More of your days, more of your nights
More of your wrong, more of your right
Whatever you got, I'll take two
I just want more, more of you
More of you

What is this hold you got on me
Stronger force than gravity
'Cause I just want more
'Cause I could spend centuries beside you
Behind you, inside you
Forever, oh, is not enough
I just want more

More of your days, more of your nights
More of your dark, more of your light
If you had a clone, I would love her too
I just want more, more of you
More of you
More of you

More of your days, more of your nights
More of your dark, more of your light
Whatever you got, darling give me too
I just want more, darling more of you
Said more of your laughs, more of your cries
More of that wisdom that lives in your eyes
In my next life I'll be looking for you
'Cause I just want more, more of you
More of you
More of you
