[Intro: Rick Ross]
All we wanted was opportunity
Just Blaze, Lord Knows!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Itâs your worst nightmare, itâs my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So Iâm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I donât trust these hoes at all
But thatâs just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that Iâm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models
Heffer and Jordan are my only role models
Thatâs why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Buy them sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But itâs whatever if somebody wanâ make it a thing
Iâm more concerned what niggas thinkinâ about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields theyâre making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like Iâm workinâ overnighters right by the motel
Drug money, outfit record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckinâ team
Matchinâ Rollies for real, matchinâ Rovers for real
Places they say theyâve been, weâve actually going for real
Iâm really killinâ shit, fuck all the jiggy rappinâ
Iâm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookinâ for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch thatâs living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if theyâd ever survive in this era
In a time where itâs recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokinâ fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yup
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne that forever
Iâm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I havenât figured it out cause my story is far from finished
Iâm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showinâ emotion donât ever mean Iâm a pussy
Know that I donât make music for niggas who donât get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, Iâm heavy, I got my weight up
Roll this and boost your rate up, itâs time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettinâ spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
Thatâs why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
You know I love this
YOLO, You Only Live Once
Iâm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink
The hustleâs an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, Iâm talkinâ Carnival cruise
And these niggas talkin like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
Itâs the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every by week, shit, Iâm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R
Headlights flickinâ, lookinâ like a fallinâ star
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think Iâm running game
Mink coats making women wanna fornicate
Rosay and Drake, Iâm gettinâ cake, nothinâ short of great
