Lyrics:


[Justin Timberlake:]
Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

[Anna Kendrick:]
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

[Earth, Wind & Fire:]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Anna Kendrick:]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

[Justin Timberlake:]
Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

[Earth, Wind & Fire:]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

And we say
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Justin Timberlake:]
The bell was ringing, aha
Our souls were singing
Do you remember
Never was a cloudy day

[Earth, Wind & Fire:]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Justin Timberlake:]
Break it down for me (say do you remember)
Dancing in September

[Earth, Wind & Fire & Justin Timberlake:]
Ba de ya
Say do you remember
Do you remember?
Ba de ya - dancing in September (dancing in September)
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

Uh huh! (bring it back now)
Dancing in September
Uh huh!
All the way down to the summer
