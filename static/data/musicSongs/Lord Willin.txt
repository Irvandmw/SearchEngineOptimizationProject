Lyrics:


Okay now this how I'm feeling, lately I'm like the villain
Cause while they on that other shit I been posted, out here chillin'
Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5
You know this that shit that you bumpin' in your whip while you drive
I've been living life, and I hope that you do the same
Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game, 'bout time that they know my name
Numb it down for the pain, this music my Novocaine
Lord Willin' we over came, it's time to get over man
I've been around the world and back and I swear it's all the same
And what I learned, a prophet don't do it for the profit gone get off
Check the topic watch me drop it, can you top it
I don't know I've been at it on the low
Never did it like this here before
But I'm still here and I just hope I'll make a difference make a killin'

Lord willin'
Lord willin'
Make a difference, lord willin'
Uh, lord willin'
I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell em

I guess I'm back at it, I ain't done, I ain't had it
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic
For this rap shit I'm an addict, but can't fuck with that dramatic
I've been busting my ass, they probably think it's automatic
Yes sir I've done this shit before like your baby momma momma
I'mma tell 'em like it is, I'mma tell 'em like it is
Life ain't picture perfect, we use the negatives to develop
I'm well up I'm way up, nothing but net, fuck the layup, I'm way up
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions
Can't fuck with they delusions, I'm on that 101 cruisin'
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way, but no not quite like this
Live it like that in a way, guess you could say made me wanna write like this
Not quite like this on my level, I'm unique and I'm a rebel
Are you listening?, I hope that you're listening
This feel like it's summertime, waiting for the bus number nine
Through the city all alone, not a worry, not your phone
We just vibing maybe flying 'round the world
Man, I hope you see the world
And all your dreams will unfurl, just don't never cash your pearl
Go out there and make a livin', take this advice that I'm givin'
Make a difference make a killin', make a killin'

Lord willin'
Lord willin'
Make a difference, lord willin'
Uh, lord willin'
I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell em
