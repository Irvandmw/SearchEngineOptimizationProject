Lyrics:


They gon' be sampling us in years to come, I'm telling you
When the world lands on you, you do push ups
It's nothing else
There was a time when all was well
All was fine but time reveals
Around the time my own road was built
It wasn't long before that train derailed
What do we promise then, what do we promise then?
When will our peace of mind begin again?
You'll find yourself saying this within
Before we begin, just breathe again

Hat back, matte black
Band of Brothers rat pack
Fear none, I'm near none, since year one I'm Jack Black
Fuck credit where credit is due, it's true that you could max that
Up until the day my money is straight I won't relax
Back-track back, homie, you don't smell me, you can Axe that
Running through that schoolyard, hammers in my knapsack
Fact, that'll make 'em send that paper in a hurry like they faxed that
Just in case you wonder what attracts that
Luck, hope they rub it hungry children, empty stomach, miss the spendin'
Pendin', we can't afford it, that's the budget from the bottom at the bottom of the bottom of the basement
I'm from where's ever that place went
I wasn't the perfect example of a classmate
So sometime in '07 was my last day
I said fuck school, I'm going to class late
I'm going balls out, they're tryna castrate
You're fishin' for the truth, no need to cast bait
I give it to you, you run with it like a fast break
I studied [?] what do you do when you see the markets thin?
Well you should park a tin
I was a model then, then I was model-thin
Was closer to the top, more than a bottle rim
But then I gotta whim, like hey you gotta win
You gotta branch out, you got a lot of limb

Feels like I'm running through this fire blind
Tired but I'm running out of time
Let it all out, you let it all in
You work it all out, you never call in
Ya let it all out, you let it all in
Remember all this if you ever fall in
You gotta breathe again

Never been afraid to fall, so I've never been afraid of fights
And I learned that I had to walk tall, so I never been afraid of heights
Insane, I ain't saying that I'm saying I've been a tough tough guy all my life
What a shame what I'm saying when the pain never came, never tried to change my flights
Whether it's just me, on the tarmac
Or riding, with the car packed
Before you diss me, get the history
I ride year, get the Carfax
I space out like Star Trek because that's just my way to deal
With my story just ain't adding up, that arithmetic ain't real
So this is what this is, airtight, no hisses
Diss tracks, no mishaps, just wish raps, no misses
Contrast, blue poles, hunger, no soup bowls
Ain't street but it ain't sweet on the same beat, no glucose

Feels like I'm running through this fire blind
Tired but I'm running out of time
Let it all out, you let it all in
Work it all out, you never call in
Let it all out, you let it all in
Remember all this if you ever fall in
You gotta breathe again
