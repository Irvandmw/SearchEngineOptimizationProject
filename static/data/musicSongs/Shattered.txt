Lyrics:


[Nick:] Ah

[A.J:]
So empty, can't feel no more,
As I'm left with my tears on the floor
I wait for my heart to mend,
But you keep tearing a hole

[Brian:]
Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting far too long

[Brian:] And now I'm shattered,
[Nick:] (From you chipping my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
[Brian:] Oh how it hurts
[Nick:] Felt it slip from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
[Brian:] I'm so shattered
[Nick, Howie:] (Can't believe you left me, I'm so shattered)
[Brian:] So shattered
[Nick, Howie:] (Can't believe, you left me, ah)

[Brian:] So shattered

[Nick, Howie:] Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered

[Brian:] I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

[Nick:]
What am I still here for,
Could it be that I'm just waiting
Hoping you'd rescue me,
And put the pieces together again

[Howie:]
Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting far too long

[Brian:] And now I'm shattered
[Howie:] Oh
[Nick:] From you chipping my heart, kept taking it till it broke
[Brian:] Oh how it hurts
[Nick:] Felt it slip from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered
[Brian:] I'm so shattered
[Nick, Howie:] Can't believe you left me, I'm so shattered
[Brian:] So shattered
[Nick, Howie:] Can't believe, you left me, ah
[Brian:] So shattered
[Nick, Howie:] Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered
[Brian:] I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

[Nick:]
Tell me what you're really here for,
If you never really loved me
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough

'Cause all you had to say was that you ain't
Looking for commitment
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, oh-ho

[Howie:]
You took my emotions
And scattered them on the ground
So hard to just pick up,
And move on with life, again

[Brian:] And now I'm shattered
[A.J.:] Oh
[Nick:] From you chipping my heart, kept taking it till it broke
[Brian:] Oh how it hurts
[Nick:] Felt it slip from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered
[Brian:] I'm so shattered
[Nick, Howie:] Can't believe you left me, I'm so shattered
[Brian:] So shattered
[Nick, Howie:] Can't believe, you left me, ah
[Brian:] So shattered
[Nick, Howie:] Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered
[Brian:] I'm shattered, cut from with-inside

[A.J.:] So shattered
[Brian:] Oh yes, I can't believe, you left me, so shattered
