Lyrics:
Lyrics:


It should be illegal to
Be as handsome as you are
You should be locked up
So you can't break nobody else's heart

Cause you steal the beauty from
The whole rest of the world
What you do to me
It could kill a girl
Oh-oh-oh

Shame on you
'Cause of you
The sun never looked so dull
Shame on you
'Cause of you
The flowers aren't as colorful
Shame on you
'Cause next to you
There's nothing special about a waterfall
Shame on you
For being so beautiful

I lay on my bed tonight and
I wonder where you are
Since you're not here with me baby
Midnight never felt so dark

'Cause you stole light from every star up in the sky
What you do to me
It should be a crime
Oh-oh-oh

Shame on you
'Cause of you
The sun never looked so dull
Shame on you
'Cause of you
The flowers aren't as colorful
Shame on you
'Cause next to you
There's nothing special about a waterfall
Shame on you
For being so beautiful

You're the only thing that's beautiful
You're the only thing that's beautiful
You're the only thing that's beautiful
You're the only thing that's beautiful
Ooh-oh-oh

Shame on you
'Cause of you
The sun never looked so dull
Shame on you
'Cause of you
The flowers aren't as colorful
Shame on you
'Cause next to you
There's nothing special about a waterfall
Shame on you
For being so beautiful

You're the only thing that's beautiful
(You're the only thing that's beautiful)
The only thing that's beautiful
You're the only thing that's beautiful
(You're the only thing that's beautiful)
The only thing that's beautiful
You're the only thing that's beautiful
The only thing that's beautiful
