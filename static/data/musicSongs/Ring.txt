[Doja Cat:]
Yeah, yeah
This one is hot, that one like ice
This one is loud, that one is quiet
You can hear my diamond
You can hear my diamonds
This one is hot (Hot), that one like ice (Ice)
This one is loud (Yo), that one is quiet
You can hear my diamond
You can hear my diamonds

In the jewelry shop
In the jewelry shop
In the jewelry shop
In the jewelry shop
You can hear my diamonds (Ring)
You can hear my diamonds (Sing)
This one is rainbow
That one is bright
All these right here, on the shelf they are mine
This oneâll drip when you put it in the light
That one the only one Iâm sleeping in at night
(Yeah) Can you smell what the rock is cooking?
(Ayy) It smell like my mommaâs cooking
I got diamonds stretching out my hair
Feel like Iâm a Buddhist
I feel like the thing
Man I swear, maybe Iâm a Newton
(Yeah) Diamonds on the banger
When I donât know what to do
I wing it like an angel
Singing like an angel
Get it on a video and beam at every angle

This one is hot, that one like ice
This one is loud, that one is quiet
You can hear my diamond (Ring)
You can hear my diamonds (Sing)
This one is hot, that one like ice
This one is loud, that one is quiet
You can hear my diamond (Ring)
You can hear my diamonds (Sing)

Baby you can hear my diamonds sing
Just another day in the life of a queen
It ainât 'bout the money honey itâs about the bling
Tell em kick rocks if theyâre training for a team
And if the sun donât rise
I raise my Tiffanyâs eye
Baby Iâm feeling just like Iâm picking a lie
Gotta be tripping to get me sleeping at night
Baby, you canât shine like me
Swimming in the 24K
Caught winning in the party, aye
Once you get it you donât want no other way
No other way

[Wes Period:]
My chain sound like a Linus faucet
Blues and Reds, I side the invisible set
Precious metals mixed together
VVS baguettes
You need a big fat check
To get these drips like Wes (Uh)
My diamonds pack a punch like that
Gal, your pockets looking famished
Pack a lunch before you pass out
Celine dissect with rubies this is saline solution
If your diamonds sound like drool
You need to get a better jeweler

[Doja Cat:]
This one is hot, that one like ice
This one is loud, that one is quiet
You can hear my diamond (Ring)
You can hear my diamonds (Ring)
This one is hot, that one like ice
This one is loud, that one is quiet
You can hear my diamond (Ring)
You can hear my diamonds (Ring)
Yeah
