Lyrics:


(Farewell
Didnât mean to let youâ¦)

After all these wasted nights
I canât pretend that Iâm doing fine
Iâve played it back a thousand times
But now I see it
And I realize

That the damage is done and itâs obvious
We can never go back to the way it was
Weâre drifting apart and itâs killing us
Itâs killing us

Farewell
Didnât mean to let you..

Let you down
Mess it up
We both knew we couldnât last forever
Itâs coming down
Iâve had enough
I guess we crumbled under all the pressure
Did my best
For what itâs worth
And I gave you all this heart can give so

Farewell
I didnât mean to let you
Down (Down)

There was a time youâd scream my name
It used to be my getaway
Now all we do is just complain
Maybe Iâm the one to blame

But the damage is done and itâs obvious
We can never go back to the way it was
Weâre drifting apart and itâs killing us
Itâs killing us

Farewell
Didnât mean to let you..

Let you down
Mess it up
We both knew we couldnât last forever
Itâs coming down
Iâve had enough
I guess we crumbled under all the pressure
Did my best
For what itâs worth
And I gave you all this heart can give so

Farewell
I didnât mean to let you
Down (Down)

Itâs such
A shame
How did we end up this way
We canât go back
And things will never be the same
All hopes faded
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

Farewell
I didnât mean to let you..

Let you down
Mess it up
We both knew it couldnât last forever
Itâs coming down
Iâve had enough
I guess we crumbled under all the pressure
Did my best
For what itâs worth
And I gave you all this heart can give, so

Farewell
Didnât mean to let you

Farewell
Didnât mean to let you
Down
Down
(Farewell)
