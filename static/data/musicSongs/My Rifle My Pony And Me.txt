Lyrics:


Sun is sinking in the west
The cattle go down to the stream
The redwing settles in the nest
It's time for a cowboy to dream

Purple light in the canyon
That is where I long to be
With my three good companions
Just my rifle, my pony and me

Gonna hang my sombrero
On the limb of a tree
Coming home sweet my darling
Just my rifle, my pony and me

Whippoorwill in the willow
Sings a sweet melody
Riding to Amarillo
Just my rifle, my pony and me

No more cows to be ropin'
No more strays will I see
'round the bend shell be waitin
For my rifle, my pony and me
For my rifle, my pony and me
