Lyrics:


(Let us break bread together on our knees.)
(Let us break bread together on our knees.)
(When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun,
(Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me.)
(Let us break bread together on our knees, on our knees.)
(Let us break bread together on our knees, on our knees.)
(When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun,)
(Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me.)
Let us drink wine together on our knees.
(Let us drink wine together on our knees)
(When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun,)
(Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me.)
(Let us pray God together on our knees,)
(On our knees, let us pray God together on our knees)
(On my knees, when I fall on my knees with my face to the rising sun,
(Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me)
Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me.
(Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me)
