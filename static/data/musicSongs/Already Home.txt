Lyrics:


The trouble with truth is it never lies,
and the trouble with wrong that its never right,
so I rest my head onto your light.

The trouble with peace is it never fights,
and the trouble with love that its always blind.
I want to walk to the edge of it tonight, and I fall down.

I'm on my knees cause your everthing I need,
and I've made a mess of myself on my own.
Well I am on my face and I'm calling out your name,
and I won't runaway cause I'm already home.

The trouble with tears is that they dry,
and the trouble with faith made me wanna cry.
I've never felt so much like I'm alive,
I wanna open my eyes and see your face.
If I have to wait a thousand days,
I'd still be right here right next to you.

And I fall down,
I'm on my knees cause your everthing I need,
and I've made a mess of myself on my own.
And now I am on my face and I'm calling out your name,
and I won't runaway cause I'm already home.

and I won't runaway,
I won't runaway,
I won't runaway cause I'm already home.

And I know I haven't always been
Where you wanted me
I'm standin' here, arms out
Broken down
Before you
I know I haven't always been,
where you wanted me,
Standin' here, arms out
Broken down

I'm on my knees cause your everthing I need,
and I've made a mess of myself on my own.
And now I am on my face and I'm calling out your name,
and I won't runaway cause I'm already home.
