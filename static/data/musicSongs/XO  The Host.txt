Lyrics:


Shots of the Henny
Bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face
You donât wanna sing no more
Lost your C notes
Cabbed all day
Took the bus back home
Evictions on your door
Blame it on the weed
Blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night lights
Lights passinâ you
Yeah
Just donât blame it on me
That you wanna come and party
With a nigga like me
Cuzâ I get it
Youâre built like a Goddess
And it seems like you been stressinâ
Specially when ya nose red
From the K special diet coke
You need more bread
âNow you got no rent
You blow that money money
You try to window shop
You blow another hundred
Shes fuckinâ gone till the day
Have some nights down town
And yaâ daddy donât know youâre out

If they donât let you in
You know where to find me
Cus if you wanna go again
You can always call me
Cus all we ever do is love
Open up yaâ mind you can find the love
Girl you ainât alone
We all been in the love
Baby just be honest

XO Ohhhh
Donât you forget
XO
Donât you worry boutâ a thing
XO
Weâll be everything you need

And Woooaaahhh

I love it when your eyes are red
Ahhh Yeaa
Are you on my cloud yet?
Cusâ I got a brand new cam
Can we video feed
Can we POV
Ohhhh Ohh
I wanna catch you at your best
Ohhhh
When your hairs a mess
You look so depressed
And your filled with regret
And you feel like you gotta go home
Ohhhh

Cus these nights pass
So much quicker then the days did
Same clothes you ainât ready for yaâ day shift
But your up you need money for yaâ face lift
Lust over love
Is your mindset
Waken up with most of yaâ side wet
Another roomy hear ya mom cryinâ
Cusâ she found ya bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party

If they wonât let you in
You know where to find me
And if you wanna go again
You can always call me
Cus all we ever do is love
Open up yaâ mind you can find the love
Girl you ainât alone
We all been in the love
Baby just be honest

Woooaaahhh

I need, I need something from you
Oh, thereâs so much love to pass around
Thereâs too much love
Girl, the nightâs almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
Girl, it wasnât long ago
Didnât think Iâd go this far
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
Thereâs just something that I
Need for you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Ride it out
Oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out
Just ride it
