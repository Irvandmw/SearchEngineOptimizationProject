[BeyoncÃ©:]
Everybody say yeah (yeah!)
Say yeah! (yeah!)
Everybody say yeah (yeah!)
Say yeah! (yeah!)
Say yeah! (yeah!)
Say yeah! (yeah!)
Just a little bit of sou-ou-ou-oul (sou-ou-ou-oul)
Just a little bit of sou-ou-ou-oul (sou-ou-ou-oul)
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Clap your hands just a little bit louder

Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Well I know
Everybody had a good time
Now if you want me to,
if you want me to
Iâm gonna swing the song, yeah
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Clap your hands just a little bit louder

Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Say yeah! (yeah!)
Say yeah! (yeah!)
Say yeah! (yeah!)

[Ed Sheeran:]
Everyoneâs feeling pretty
Itâs hotter than July
Though the worldâs full of problems
They couldnât touch us even if they tried

[BeyoncÃ©:]
From the park I hear rhythms
Marleyâs hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Ed Sheeran:]
Didnât know you
Would be jamminâ until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
would be jamminâ and jamminâ and jamminâ, jam on

[Ed Sheeran:]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip way

[BeyoncÃ©:]
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third Worldâs right on the one
Nowâs the time for celebration
âCause weâve only just begun
Didnât know you
Would be jamminâ until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamminâ until the break of dawn
Didnât know you
Would be jamminâ until the break of dawn
would be jamminâ and jamminâ and jamminâ
would be jamminâ and jamminâ and jamminâ, jam on

[Gary Clark Jr.:]
People keep on learninâ
Soldiers keep on warrinâ

[BeyoncÃ©:]
World

[Gary Clark Jr.:]
Keep on turninâ
âCause it wonât to be too long

[BeyoncÃ©:]
Powers keep on lyinâ
While your people keep on dyinâ
World keep on turninâ
âCause it wonât be too long

[BeyoncÃ© & Gary Clark Jr.:]
Iâm so darn glad he let me try it again
âCause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
Iâm so glad that I know more than I knew then
keep on tryinâ till I reach my highest ground
Iâm so darn glad he let me try it again
âCause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
Iâm so glad that I know more than I knew then
keep on tryinâ till I reach my highest ground

[BeyoncÃ©:]
Câmon, câmon, câmon, câmon
Câmon, câmon, câmon, câmon
