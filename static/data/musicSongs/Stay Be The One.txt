Lyrics:


I saw you last night
Down at the Mare
Saw how you were playin' gently with her hair
I see you and I
In my mirror
I close my eyes and wish that you would be here

It's my fantasy
To have you all to me
Baby
I'm goin' privately crazy
Do you know what you're doin' to me

Stay
Make my blue moon bright for a
Change
Make my dreams end right
Don't stay
Afrai-ai-ai-aid

Be the one

Yeah

Yeah yeah yeah

Get out of my head
Get into my heart
Be for real
I can't fix who we are
I made up this lie
I made up this life
When I'm alone it's like you're right by my si-i-ide

It's my fantasy
To have you all to me
Baby
I'm goin' privately crazy
If you came I know just what I'd say

Stay
Make my blue moon bright for a
Change
Make my world turn right
Don't stay
Afrai-ai-ai-aid

Be the one

Hey yeah oh
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ye-e-eah oh
Oh yeah
Oh yeah ye-e-eah
Yeah

It's my fantasy
To have you all to me
Baby
I'm goin' privately crazy
If you know what you're doin' to me

Stay
Make my blue moon bright for a
Change
Make my dreams end right
Don't stay
Afrai-ai-ai-aid

Be the one
