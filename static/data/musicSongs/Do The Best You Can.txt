Lyrics:


Whenever you find a man
Who loves every woman he sees
There's always some kind of woman
That's puttin' him up a tree
Now that kind of man he ain't got
As much sense as a mule
You know everyone can love it
Just playin' you for a fool

Mmmm, oh no, it's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can

If you marry the wrong kinda woman
And you get where you can't agree
Just damn well forget yourself
And let that woman be
A man ought to be a good husband
Quit tryin' to lead a fast life
Goin' about dressin' up other women
Won't put clothes on his own wife

Mmmm, oh no, it's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can

Well there's a lot's of good women wanna marry
They wanna live well at home
Afraid they might get hold of a rowdy man
Who can't let other women alone
Well there's a lot's of good men who wanna marry
They wanna live well at home
But everytime they turn around there's a man there
Sayin' "Darlin' is he gone?"

Mmmm, oh no, it's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can
