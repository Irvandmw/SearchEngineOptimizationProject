Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I gave you the benefit of the doubt
'Til you showed me what you were about
Your true colors came out

And your words couldn't hide the sin
'Cause the truth about where you been
Is in a fragrance I can't recognize

Just standing there, scratching your head
Bloodshot eyes, drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge

I'm done with this, feeling like an idiot
Loving you, I'm over it
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay

See you, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say
You're so yesterday

Baby, what you're saying to me is
There's no more you and I
I couldn't get it right on yesterday
So kiss our tomorrows goodbye

Baby, love should brought me home
Should've just been a man about it
But now I'm crying like a baby
Girl, your love was like my blanket
Don't know what to do without it

I'm standing here, pleading my case
You don't care to hear what I say
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge

My promises don't mean nothing
The end is so disgusting
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay

Honey, you, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say, so yesterday

And now you wanna reminisce
Say you wanna try again
It started with a little kiss
But we can't even be friends

No, no, now I never wanna see you
Never wanna feel you, never wanna hear you
I don't love you, don't need you
Can't stand you no more

You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay

You, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
Don't wanna hear a thing you say

So yesterday, so yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday
