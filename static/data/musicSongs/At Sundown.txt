Lyrics:


Every little breeze is sighin'
Of love undyin' at sundown
Every little bird is restin'
And feather nestin' at sundown.

Each little rosebud is sleeping
While shadows are creeping
In a little cottage cozy
The world seems rosy at sundown.

Where a loving smile will greet me
And always meet me at sundown
I seem to sigh I'm in heaven
When night is fallin'
And love is callin' me home.

(Every little breeze is sighin'
Of love undyin' at sundown
Every little bird is restin'
And feather nestin' at sundown.)

Each little rosebud is sleeping
While shadows are creeping
In a little cottage cozy
The world seems rosy at sundown.

Callin' me home, callin' me home...
