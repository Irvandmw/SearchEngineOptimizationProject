Lyrics:


You came a long way from St. Louis, 
You climbed the ladder of success . . . 
I've seen the flashy foreign cars 
That were parked out in front of 
Your fancy address! 

You came a long way from St. Louis, 
You broke a lot of hearts between . . . 
I've met a gang of gloomy guys 
Who were doin' all right 
'Till you came on the scene! 

You blew in from the middle-west 
And certainly impressed 
The population here-abouts . . .
Well baby, I got news for you,
I'm from Missouri too, 
So, naturally, I got my doubts! 

You got 'em droppin' by the way-side, 
A feelin' I ain't gonna know . . . 
You came a long way from St. Louis, 
But baby, you still got a long way to go! 

[instrumental break]

My, how you come up! 
Hmmm, you really come on! 

[instrumental break]

Hey, I'll have your address! 
St. Louis woman, 
You're a St. Louis doll! 

[instrumental break]

You blew in from the middle-west 
And certainly impressed 
The population here-abouts . . .
Well baby, I've got news for you,
I'm from Missouri too, 
So, naturally, I got my doubts! 

You got 'em droppin' by the way-side, 
A feelin' I ain't gonna know . . . 
You came a long way from St. Louis, 
But baby, you still got a long way to go! 

You left St. Louis far behind, 
Keep this little thought in mind, 
You still . . . got a long way to go!
