Lyrics:


How can I see when my eyes are closed
How can you be so far away and already wanna go
How can we talk when our mouths are closed
And I want you to know I can't fix what you have broke

Close my eyes and go to sleep ohhh
You're the last thing the last thing that I see

I had a thousand words to say you just chose to walk away
And are you happy now you're free ohhh
You gave me your heart and took it back from me
Now I've seen the light of day
Boy you don't mean shit to me

How can we write when the ink is gone
Our loves an empty page that you've never written on
How can we be what we used to be
Was it all just make-believe when my heart was on my sleeve

Close my eyes and go to sleep ohhh
You're the last thing the last thing that I see

I had a thousand words to say you just chose to walk away
And are you happy now you're free ohhh
You gave me your heart and took it back from me
Now I've seen the light of day
Boy you don't mean shit to me

Our loves a postcard on its way heading towards no destiny [x4]

Close my eyes and go to sleep oooh
You're the last thing the last thing that I see

I had a thousand words to say you just chose to walk away
And are you happy now you're free ooohh
You gave me your heart and took it back from me
Now I've seen the light of day
Boy you don't mean shit to me
