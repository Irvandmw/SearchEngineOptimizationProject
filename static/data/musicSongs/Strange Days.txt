Lyrics:


Raise a glass to the end of it all
Who's to blame when it's everyone's fault?
And we celebrate our way through dangerous times
Strange days are comin' for us
Say goodbye to the way that it was
And we celebrate our way through dangerous times

I'm livin' in the strange days
I'm livin' in a world that I don't know
Get ready for the dark age
I'm livin' in the strange days so
Say goodbye to the silence
We can dance to the sirens
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come

Never know when it's all goin' down
All I have is right here and now
So we'll make this moment last forever
And if we go we go together

I'm livin' in the strange days
I'm livin' in a world that I don't know
Get ready for the dark age
I'm livin' in the strange days so
Say goodbye to the silence
We can dance to the sirens
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come

One of these nights
I'll take you down to the fire
With red in our eyes
We're gonna dance to the sirens
Say goodbye to the silence

(I'm livin' the strange days)

I'm livin' in the strange days so
Say goodbye to the silence
We can dance to the sirens
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come
