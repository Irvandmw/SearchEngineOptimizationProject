Lyrics:


I wish it was Christmas
Christmas every day
We could just let it snow forever
And live on holiday
There would be presents every morning
Under every tree
Oh Santa Claus, if I could have my way
I wish it was Christmas every day

School is out, no work today
So in my PJ's I will stay
Staring at this winter wonderland
The reindeer slippers on my feet
A Christmas Vacation on TV
I feel like I am just a kid again

I can see the Christmas lights appear
Welcome to the best time of the year

I wish it was Christmas
Christmas every day
We could just let it snow forever
And live on holiday
There would be presents every morning
Under every tree
Oh Santa Claus, if I could have my way
I wish it was Christmas every day

Kissing under mistletoe
Fifty-two weeks in a row
Now you got me shouting out with glee
No more wars and no more fights
Peace on earth comes every night
What a wonderful world this could be

I can see the Christmas lights appear
Welcome to the best time of the year

I wish it was Christmas
Christmas every day
We could just let it snow forever
And live on holiday
There would be presents every morning
Under every tree
Oh Santa Claus, if I could have my way
I wish it was Christmas every day
Christmas every day

I wish it was Christmas
Christmas every day
We could just let it snow forever
And live on holiday
There would be presents every morning
Under every tree
Oh Santa Claus, if I could have my way
I wish it was Christmas
I wish it was Christmas
Oh, I wish it was Christmas every day
