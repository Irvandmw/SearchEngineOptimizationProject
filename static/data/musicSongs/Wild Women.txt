Lyrics:


Can I act like an angel
If I live like a jerk
Can I keep on disguising
Can I make believe
That I don't deceive
No..no..no

[Chorus:]
Send the wild women out the backdoor
My wife is knocking at the frontdoor
They made me a winner they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do
Dirty money in the left hand
While the preacher's shaking my right hand
They made me a winner they made me a sinner
I don't know what to do

When I'm riding on top of
The wave of success
Will I lose my devotion
Will I fail to see
What I used to be
Oh..oh..oh

[Chorus:]
Send the wild women out the backdoor
My wife is knocking at the frontdoor...

I'll have to carry on
As two persons in one........
Two persons in one.....

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah...
Two persons in one.....

Aiyi Aiyi Ai

[Chorus:]
Wild Women out the backdoor
My wife is knocking at the frontdoor... [X3]
