Lyrics:


Most of my life
I sat on my hands.
I don't make a sound.
Getting it right
I made all my plans.
Lost, never found.

Your eyes, your smile can light up the night, night.
Embers and neon signs paint up our sky, sky.

Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly.
We'll never die.
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams set on fire,
Rising up higher.
Like I've something to prove, nothing to lose.
In this city, in this city. Whoa.

All of this time
I questioned myself.
I never could wait.
Looking for signs,
Not asking for help.
I know it's too late.

Love lost and buried here. It comes to life, life.
Make believe worlds make us all feel alive, live.

Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly.
We'll never die.
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams set on fire,
Rising up higher.
Like I've something to prove, nothing to lose.
In this city, in this city. Oh.

I don't ever wanna wait for this,
I know that I was made for this.
I won't fade into dark.
I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry,
Gonna see the end of this story.
I won't fade into darkness.

Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly.
We'll never die.
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams set on fire,
Rising up higher
Like I've something to prove, nothing to lose.
In this city, in this city. Oh.
