Lyrics:


Thank you, thank you darling for everything you gave to me
Not just for the broken heart, but the precious memory
I remember darlin' everything we used to do
Walkin' together hand in hand, and the first time I kissed you
I said thank you, thank you darling for everything you gave to me
Not just for the broken heart, but the precious memory

I remember darling, the time I brought you home to late
We were so afraid, afraid it would be our very last date
I said thank you, thank you darling for everything you gave to me
Not just for the broken heart, but the precious memory

I said thank you, thank you darling
Thank you, thank you darling
Thank you, thank you darling
