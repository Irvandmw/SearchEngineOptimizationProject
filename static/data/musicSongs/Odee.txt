Lyrics:


Young Troy, you a genius
Beat it up like yeah girl

Yeah, 44 bulldog
Hit a nigga melon, spill a nigga bean
Everybody saying what they gonna do
But they just talking, they don't mean it
Try to run down with the deuce deuce
That's a no-no, get a forty, yup
Yeah, I know I'm prolly too much
Sometimes, I just be odeeing

I was gonna go and try to fall asleep
But, I got too much energy
I was gonna go to Canada deep
But, all my niggas said they got felonies
I was gonna pull up in Givenchy
But, I just bought all this ERD shit
I'm too fleek, all the groupies
Yeah, they just wanna get next to me
Yeah, everybody said they run down
Til' they hear that gun sound on that lemon squeeze
Yeah, bet ya' homie ain't ya' homie
Trust me paparazzi, that's the police

Yeah, 44 bulldog
Hit a nigga melon, split a nigga bean
Everybody saying what they gonna do
But they just talking, they don't mean it
Try to run down with the deuce deuce
That's a no-no, get a forty, yup
Yeah, I know I'm prolly too much
Sometimes, I just be odeeing
Sometimes, I just be odeeing
(She love God and she know Jesus)
Sometimes, I just be odeeing
(Girl I smoke pot just for no reason)
Sometimes, I just be odeeing
(Sometimes, I just be o yeah)
Sometimes, I just be odeeing

And sometimes I just be odeeing
Now, I'm from Highbridge, what you thinking?
You can punch in mine if yours is reading
And you can punch in mine if yours is reading
I give you all my time if you give me reasons
You only call my line when you think I'm creeping
The 30 clip too long, you can probably see it
It's a Hip-Hop song, but I'm R&B-ing

Yeah, 44 bulldog
Hit a nigga melon, split a nigga bean
Everybody saying what they gonna do
But they just talking, they don't mean it
Try to run down with the deuce deuce
That's a no-no, get a forty, yup
Yeah, I know I'm prolly too much
Sometimes, I just be odeeing
