Lyrics:


She came looking for me with her arms open wide,
like some long lost friend of mine.

She said 'Excuse me, but do you remember me ?'
I said 'No, I don't believe I do'
So she looked me up and down
and undressed me with her eyes,
then she said 'You've got everything I need, you've got everything I want'

So I said 'OK,

you can wear my hat,
you can have my coat,
you can take my shirt
'cos I don't need it.
You can wear my shoes,
you can take my socks,
come on take my bag it's yours

If you love it,
you can have it if you love it,
ain't no problem if you love it,
come on take it if you love it.

So her friend came up to me
with a pen and paper in her hand,
expressing some interest in the number of my room,
She said 'Excuse me, but do you remember me? '
I said 'No,' she said 'Can I appeal to you?'

So I looked her up and down
and realising her insinuations I blushed
she said 'Listen babe you don't know me,
no you don't know me but you owe me,

and I love you,
yes I love you,
put your arms around me 'cos I love you,
I got all your records and I love you'

So I suggested

you can wear my hat,
you can have my coat,
you can take my shirt
'cos I don't need it.
You can wear my shoes,
you can take my socks,
come on take my bag it's yours

If you love it,
you can have it if you love it,
ain't no problem if you love it,
come on take it if you love it.

Well later on that day this guy came to me
with a scrap of paper in his hand
he said 'Hey buddy can you sign your name for me?'
I said 'Why, do I owe you money?' He said 'No'
I said 'Listen pal do I know you? Have we ever met?
Why do you want my name on this little piece of paper?

He said 'I love you,
I don't know you but I love you,
like my brother I love you,
put your arms around me 'cos I love you'

I said 'Hey let's not rush things

you can wear my hat,
you can have my coat,
you can take my shirt
'cos I don't need it.
You can wear my shoes,
you can take my socks,
come on take my bag it's yours

If you love it,
you can have it if you love it,
ain't no problem if you love it,
come on take it if you love it.

You can wear my hat,
You can wear my hat,
You can wear my hat,
Come on wear my hat.'
