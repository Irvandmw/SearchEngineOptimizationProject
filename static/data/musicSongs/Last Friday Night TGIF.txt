[Missy Elliot:]
Hey yo Katy
Let's hit em with the remix baby
Let's goâ¦

It's a Friday night now here we go
I ain't no stripper but I work the pole
Bartender can you pour some more
And I'm so tipsy coming out my clothes
Fly high high high
And I can't see so I can't drive
I party 'til I'm out my mind
I kiss on him but he don't mind
Then I wake up in the morn
I got a guy in my bed like "Hello, good morn."
Don't remember how I got him home
But Friday night it was nice and long

[Katy Perry:]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a mÃ©nage Ã  trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh, well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a mÃ©nage Ã  trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop

This Friday night
Do it all again
(Do it all again)
This Friday night
Do it all again
(Do it all again)
This Friday night

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

[Missy Elliot:]
Let's do this shit like every weekend

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

[Missy Elliot:]
Now pour my drink 'til there ain't nothing left.

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a mÃ©nage Ã  trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop

This Friday night
Do it all again
