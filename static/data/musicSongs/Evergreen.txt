Lyrics:


I've been on the run 
Slept under the sun 
Feeding off the clouds and eating
Them like ice cream 
I've been all around 
Never left this town 
Blisters on my eyelids like it's
Spring in paris 
I've seen everything, I've dreamt
Every dream 
I am every human 
Oh I'm not even finished 

Look how I go 
Impeccable flow 
Wind in my face it hardly ever
Rains 
Always on top 
I'm coming up 
I'm everything and I am everything 
I know it all don't know a thing 
I am changing, still the same 
I'm every color I'm every color 
I am evergreen 

I've been on the side 
Always stayed ahead 
I'm so very fast give me a
Speeding ticket 
Me you cannot teach 
I just wanna know 
I've been tryin to stand but I
Will never grow 
I've seen everything, I've dreamt
Every dream 
I am every human 
No I'm not even finished 

Look how I go 
Impeccable flow 
Wind in my face it hardly ever
Rains 
Always on top 
I'm coming up 
I'm everything and I am everything 
I know it all don't know a thing 
I am changing, still the same 
I'm every color I'm every color 
I am evergreen 

The truth is stranger than fiction 
When you're a walking contradiction 
When you're evergreen 
You're always looking in 
You're the first one left 
But you're back again 
Don't be afraid to ask 
But don't ask again 
We'll forever last when you're
Evergreen 

Look how I go 
Impeccable flow 
Wind in my face it hardly ever
Rains 
Always on top 
I'm coming up 
I'm everything and I am everything 
I know it all don't know a thing 
I am changing, still the same 
I'm every color, I'm every color 
I'm every color 
I'm every color (color) 
I am evergreen 
Yea I am evergreen 
I am evergreen 
I am evergreen
