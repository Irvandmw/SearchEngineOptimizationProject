Lyrics:


Tonight, my head is spinning
I need something to pick me up
Iâve tried but nothing is working
I wonât stop
I wonât say Iâve had enough
Tonight, I start the fire
Tonight, I break away

[Chorus:]
Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you canât stand the way
This place is
Take yourself to higher places

(ohhh, ohhh)

At night I feel like a vampire
Itâs not right 
I just canât give it up
Iâll try to get myself higher
Letâs go
Weâre going to light it up
Tonight we start the fire
Tonight we break away

[Chorus:]
Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you canât stand the way 
This place is
Take yourself to higher places

If you canât stand the way this place is
Take (take) yourself (yourself)
To higher places

[Chorus:]
Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you canât stand the way 
This place is
Take yourself to higher places

(ohhâ¦higher places)
(ohhâ¦to higher places)
(ohhâ¦higher places)
Take yourself to higher places
