Lyrics:


[John Legend:]
Fire and the ice colliding, I wanna go deep and dive in
It's heaven on Earth but hell of a night to melt into one
She's never been afraid of sirens, head down but keep drivin'
Damn we might crash moving so fast but baby

[John Legend & Brittany Howard:]
Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh

[Brittany Howard:]
Darkness and light, streaming, the end of our life beginning
No longer alone, my will become gone, we melt into one
Both hands on the floor, you go low
Who was I before? I don't know
And who am I now? Your body shows how
The past just has no meaning

[John Legend & Brittany Howard:]
Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh

Oh, don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it
