Artist: Richard Marx Lyrics
Song Name: The Edge Of Forever
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


No one can decide
When lightning will strike
And everything falls into place
But lately it seems
When you're in my dreams
I find that I don't want to wake

I wanna slowly
Unlock the mystery
I wanna make love
I wanna make history

[Chorus:]
With you
I see a lifetime with you
And if one thing is true
It's that God knew someday I'd be standing
On the edge of forever with you

I'm ready to fall
To give you my all
Cause you're everything I'll ever want
It's amazing to me
How far we can see
Our horizon goes on and on

I wanna slowly
Unlock the mystery
I wanna make love
I wanna make history

[Chorus]

And when I'm shivering
Your body will be my blanket
And then I'm drifting, baby
You'll be my anchor

[Chorus]
