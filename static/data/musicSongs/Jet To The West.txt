Lyrics:


I can take you out like what you wanna do
But that that don't mean nothing
If it wasn't you
Asked about me she know I ball out I do
I just hit It once but I need a round 2
I got a chain I can hang from yo neck
Last nigga heard you used him for a check
Brand new whip put that shit to the test
I was in New York I took a jet to the west

Oh mm lil baby then I want you like mmm
Whole gang gone slide so we slide thru
Like mmm
Yo girls gone ride then we ride too
Like mmm
I'm not the one to lie to

Smokin packs packs packs
Shoot a nigga from behind
Bring it back back back
I'm gone break yo spine
Where you at where you at
I'm trynna make you mine
Mm tap tap ring the button when you hit my line
Bust down yo wrist trynna get some of yo time
Stars on the roof pull up we gone shine
See you walk by and I watch you rewind mm
Smokin on gas we don't sip no wine
Oh mm lil baby then I want you like mmm
Whole gang gone slide so we slide thru
Like mmm
Yo girls gone ride then we ride too
Like mmm
I'm not the one to lie to

I'm not the one to lie to mmm

I'm not the one to lie to mmm
