Lyrics:


Take a breath
I pull myself together
Just another step
Until I reach the door

You'll never know the way
It tears me up inside to see you
I wish that I could tell you something
To take it all away

Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up 'til it's over
If it takes you forever I want you to know

When I hear your voice
It's drowning in the whispers
You're just skin and bones
There's nothing left to take

And no matter what I do
I can't make you feel better
If only I could find the answer
To help me understand

Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up 'til it's over
If it takes you forever I want you to know

That if you fall, stumble down
I'll pick you up off the ground
If you lose faith in you
I'll give you strength to pull through

Tell me you won't give up
'Cause I'll be waiting if you fall
You know I'll be there for you

If only I could find the answer
To take it all away

Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up 'til it's over
If it takes you forever I want you to know

I wish I could save you
I want you to know

I wish I could save you
