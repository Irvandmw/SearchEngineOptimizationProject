Lyrics:


Help me
I need your love
Don't walk away
The dark scares me so
We're nothing apart
Let's stay friends forever
Forever

Here I stand and face the rain
I know that nothing's gonna be the same again
I fear for what tomorrow brings

Trust me
For who I am
Lay all your pains
Into these hands
I've got nothing to say
But let's stay friends forever
Forever

Here I stand and face the rain
I know that nothing's gonna be the same again
I fear for what tomorrow brings

Here I stand and face the pain
Of knowing nothing's gonna be the same again
I fear for what tomorrow brings

Here I stand and face the rain
Knowing nothing's gonna be the same again

Here I stand and face the rain

Knowing nothing's gonna be the same again
