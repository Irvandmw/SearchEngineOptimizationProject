Lyrics:


Ain't it funny how money is a thief that we all give our life for?
Ain't it funny how money is a lover that can never resolve?
Ain't it funny how money's just a number that we argue and fight for?
And tell me, if money's good luck, why does the stress go up
Whenever there's more money involved?

'Cause I don't want your money, I just want you next to me, honey
'Cause I don't want your money, I just want you next to me, next to me
Not just anybody, I just want you next to me, honey
'Cause I don't want your money, I just want you next to me, want you next to me

Headin' for the lens where the ends, not the means, suffices
And we're aiming for the brink where there ain't no time to think of the fall
Where history repeats and repeats and we're drawn to our vices
We ain't lemmings on the cliff, ain't it a gift when you answer the call?

'Cause I don't want your money, I just want you next to me, honey
'Cause I don't want your money, I just want you next to me, next to me
Not just anybody, I just want you next to me, honey
'Cause I don't want your money, I just want you next to me, want you next to me

There's only dead men leaving the wills
There's only dead men on your dollar bills
There's just a dead man's name on your trust
See, I got bills and change with ex-presidents' names
I bet they wish they were living like us

'Cause I don't want your money, I just want you next to me, honey
'Cause I don't want your money, I just want you next to me, next to me
Not just anybody, I just want you next to me, honey
'Cause I don't need your money, I just need you next to me, need you next to me

So keep your dead men on your dollar bills
Yeah, keep your dead men on your dollar bills
So keep your dead men on your dollar bills
