Lyrics:


You made me crawl feeling so small
Creeping like shapes along the walls 

Life fades to gray
Why must I pay
for giving my heart away 

[Chorus:]
But whatever it may take
However my heart breaks
I'll keep singing in the rain
'till your back again 

You left a hole deep in my soul
leaving my world so cold 

But standing eye to eye
I still wonder why
we had to say goodbye 

[Chorus:]
And whatever it may take
However my heart breakes
I'll keep singing in the rain
'till your back again
and whoever that changed your mind
whoever that makes you blind
I'll keep waiting here for you 

All I ventured but nothing gained
I'm walking through the rain
Trying to keep a fading flame alive 

Help!
Help me
Baby I'm lonely oh so lonely 

Will I ever feel your love again
Am I really losing you my friend
Your absent talking your missing light
Makes me lonely on a Saturday night
