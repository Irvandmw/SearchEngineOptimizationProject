Lyrics:


I'd stroll into a bank and put a ski mask on
And walk out with a million bucks
Then I'd burn it in a pile out on your front lawn
Just to prove it didn't mean that much
I'd sell everything I own, take a pile of cash
Walk into the casino, bet it all on black
Then blow all of my winnings on a limousine
To make out with you in the back, hey

I'm not afraid to look insane
'Cause I'm crazy about you

There's nothing that I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me
Baby, I know I'm all but shameless
Need you and I couldn't care less
If everyone knows that I'm your fool
Girl there's nothing I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me

I'd buy a couple red-eye one-way tickets to Paris doing first class ride
Then I'd carry your body to the top of the tower to kiss your lips at midnight
Then we'll wander through the streets, and drink champagne
Get drunk and start singing in the pouring rain
I'll a capella karaoke "Sexy Thing", 'cause, baby, I feel no shame
Say this whole world can know you're all I need
'Cause, baby, some day I'll drop and hit one knee and tell you

I'm not afraid to change your name
'Cause I'm crazy about you

There's nothing that I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me
Baby, I know I'm all but shameless
Need you and I couldn't care less
If everyone knows that I'm your fool
Girl there's nothing I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me

Throw myself out of a jet airplane
Hundred feet a second just screaming your name
I'd steal a cop car turn the blue lights on
Pick you up and drive it around âtil dawn
I'm not afraid to look insane
'Cause I'm crazy about you

Oh, oh, oh I'm not afraid to look insane
'Cause I'm crazy, crazy, crazy

There's nothing that I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me
Baby, I know I'm all but shameless
Need you and I couldn't care less
If everyone knows that I'm your fool
Girl there's nothing I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me,
Baby
