Lyrics:


Hey, kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

Oh, Candy and Ronnie. Have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie and the Jets
Ooh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie. She's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
I read it in a magazine
Bennie and the Jets

Hey, kids, why don't you plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Oh, Candy and Ronnie. Have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie and the Jets
Ooh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie. She's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
I read it in a magazine
Bennie and the Jets

Ooh, Candy and Ronnie. Have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie and the Jets
Ooh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie. She's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
I read it in a magazine
Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets, Jets, Jets, Jets
