Lyrics:


Runway, runway, runway

They'll come a day when we won't have to fight
Won't be around, who is wrong who is right
Like fireflies, and I might even lie
Just you and I, universally tied
There's truth for those who want to hear
Somewhere out in the atmosphere
To survive gotta persevere
Close to fly gotta have no fear

First they love you and then they judge you and
Try to chain you, and they drain you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let them bring you down (we do)
Remember there's only one you (oh)
There's a God up above you (you)
You can soar through the herd when it taunts you
Fly like a hummingbird if you want to
Let love be our own way
There is a higher place
Just erase that feeling when you're rising
And you're face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go, and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
When the race is in the horizon

Runway, yeah yeah
Runway, yeah
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
When you make it, now love make your runway

You have inside
And you will discover there is flawless through your terrify
And I promise there is truth for those who really want to hear
If you wanna touch the sky and fly, you've got to have no fear

First they love you and then they judge you and
Try to chain you, and they drain you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let them bring you down (we do)
Remember there's only one you (oh)
There's a God up above you (true)
You can soar through the herd when it taunts you
Fly like a hummingbird if you want to
Let love be our own way
There is a higher place
Just erase that feeling when you're rising
And you're face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go, and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
When the race is in the horizon

Runway, yeah yeah
Runway, yeah
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
When you make it, now love make your runway

Runway, runway
Now love make your runway
Runway, runway
Now love make your runway
Runway, runway
Now ove make your runway
Runway, runway
Now love make your runway

There is a higher place
Just erase that feeling when you're rising
And you're face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go, and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
When the race is in the horizon
