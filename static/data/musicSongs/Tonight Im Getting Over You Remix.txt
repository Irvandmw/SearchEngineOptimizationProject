This is the remix.
Re-Re-mix. Carly.

[Carly Rae Jepsen]
I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new

Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Over you
Over you

Stuck in a real bad dream
And man it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms but I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night
And I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no, it's not you and I

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you

[Nicki Minaj]
Tonight I'm getting over.
Meditate and do my yo-gerrr
Then I pull up to the club in a Roverrr
A Celine bag on my shoulderrr
I said rrrrrr
Cock that revolver
Rrrr-Rrrr that's that nostal-gerrr
I said I'm number one, I'm a son a gun,
And runner up is what they called ya
Ain't trying to be mean but, I am the queen, yuh
Ain't fuckin' with no fuck boys!
Get me get me, should've got me then
Cause I would wear 4 real and you would rock pretend
Yo, can I get another dose of my oxygen
Cause I been breathin' all this motherfuckin' toxin in!

Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Over you

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you

Pretty gang, Rich Gang, Young Money... Nicki Minaj... I see you Carly
