Lyrics:


I understand there's no future for us here
Guess I fooled myself into thinking there was
Now you've make it clear
I'll never be right
Now we've got to say good-bye and I've got to be strong
So tell me one more time how it's better for the both of us
Tell me one more time how we'll hurt each other if we stay
Tell me one more time the darling there's just one more thing
Before you walk away

[CHORUS]
Explain it to my heart
It's better that we're over now
Tell me one more time that this it's suppose to be
Tell me that I'm better off without you
How it's better to forget about you
Darling I understand
Now won't you please explain it to my heart
Now if I try I can see the reasons why
Why we can't stay together I might convince my mind
But it's breaking my heart to know I've got to let you go
To find that I must leave behind the only love I've known
Well I can tell myself that I never really needed you
I can tell myself that it's better just to say good-bye
I can tell myself a thousand lies
But tell me now
Tell me how I do

[CHORUS]

Say that I'll be better
If we don't stay together
Say that I'll be better off free
But don't say it to me
Explain it to my heart
