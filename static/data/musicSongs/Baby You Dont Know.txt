Lyrics:


Baby you don't know what you're doing to me
Baby you don't know pain and misery
Well the very thought of knowing that you have been untrue
Baby you don't know what you put me through

Baby you don't know all the tears I cry
Baby you don't care how many times you lie
Can't you see how much I love you, can't you see how much I care
Baby you don't know and it's just not fair

Baby you don't know how I feel inside
I got an aching heart, that I cannot hide
Well the news about your new love is spreading all over town
Baby you don't know how you put me down
