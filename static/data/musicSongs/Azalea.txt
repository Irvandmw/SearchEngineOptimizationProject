Lyrics:


It was such a fine spring day 
down Lou'siana way,
with fragrance divine 
and such magnificent regalia.
Oh, so fine, 
Azalea.

Oh what a lovely sight,
in red, pink and white. 
Can't held but believe 
that nothing evil can assail you. 
So naÃ¯ve,
Azalea 

You're at ease on the knees 
of the moss covered trees, 
whose tops meet to make a high ceiling 
in the church-like pomp 
of the cypress swamp.
I've yet to get that same strange feeling.

I've got to go back there 
and find that blossom fair
I always dream of.
'Cause with you who could be a failure? 
My first love, 
Azalea
