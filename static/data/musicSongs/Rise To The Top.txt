Lyrics:


Woo
I'm tryna pull up to he coast line and
Ask whip, with Doc and Mac, ay
You know when you step on that
300 to 500 feet where towers is on deck with lemons on 'em
(Man help yourself)
Ice cold Mimosas and shit
Oh yeah, it's 6AM where I'm at
Cloud 9 to be exact
It took a long time to get here
I make it look easy
But it took a long time to get in this chair that I'm sittin' in right now
(You have no idea)

But the main idea is to get her to dance to my song (Dance to my song)
Quite frankly, don't wanna see with nothin' on (Nothin' on)
No robes on tonight, no shoes on tonight (No shoes on tonight)
She goin' deep sea diving, goin' down, down, down tonight (Keep rising)
And I'ma keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep going, go on boy, don't ever stop
I'm gonna keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
When I take off or blast off, I ain't never stop (Don't ever stop no, no)

This feel like a cocaine song, my bulk game strong
Baby say my stroke game long
She on everything, move and choose up, who ya choosin'?
In it to win it, get it crackin', now how ya doin'?
Manoeuvrin' while we movin'
Smoky in this motherfucker while we crusin'
We off the coast of France with a host of friends
Coastal winds get close again, you the most advanced
Take my hand, go with the flow, do what I say
And walk it out and pay attention, don't you give it away
And once we make that clear, I'ma tell you what you wanna hear, yeah

But the main idea is to get her to dance to my song (Dance to my song)
Quite frankly, don't wanna see with nothin' on (Nothin' on)
No robes on tonight, no shoes on tonight (No shoes on tonight)
She goin' deep sea diving, goin' down, down, down tonight (Keep rising)
And I'ma keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep going, go on boy, don't ever stop
I'm gonna keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
When I take off or blast off, I ain't never stop (Don't ever stop no, no)

Uh, shawty my lil boo thing, put in that move sayin'
CREAM like Wu-Tang yeah
Got in that mad shit, 'cause I'm rich and handsome
Diamonds on me dancin', yeah
Smokin' on exotics, say she from the Tropics
It look like she brought it, don't care though
Fuckin' fix the stitches in her hair though
Fuck yo last nigga I know you used to the middle

Baby, don't deny what you here for
Wetter than the dimes on my earlobes
Lookin' in my eyes like it's tenfold
Wanna knock boots like Timbo's
All up in your water I'm so nautical with it
I see what I want and I gotta go get it
Once we get goin' I won't stop till you finish
But the main I, but the main idea

Is to get her to dance to my song (Dance to my song)
Quite frankly, don't wanna see with nothin' on (Nothin' on)
No robes on tonight, no shoes on tonight (No shoes on tonight)
She goin' deep sea diving, goin' down, down, down tonight (Keep rising)
And I'ma keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep going, go on boy, don't ever stop
I'm gonna keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
When I take off or blast off, I ain't never stop (Don't ever stop no, no, no)
