Lyrics:


If I told you I loved you
Would it move you enough
To even act as though you've heard?

If I said I was leavin'
Would you still find a reason
To ignore my every word?

'Cause I'm the one who waits here for you,
I'm the one who'll always adore you,
I'm the one who is dying for your cause,

Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?

If I told you to meet me in the city this evening,
Would you even think to come?
Everyone would be hearing my intentions of prolonging, 
Your easy when your numb.

'Cause I'm the one who waits here for you,
I'm the one who'll always adore you,
I'm the one who see's right through it all.

Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?

If I told you,
Would you care?
If I told you,
Would you still never be there?

If I told you,
Would you care?
(Do you care at all?)
If I told you,
Would you still never be there?

If I told you,
I need you,
Would you still not agree to even offer me your hand?

If I said I was dying,
Would you keep on denying my attempts to be your man,

'Cause I'm the one who waits here for you,
I'm the one who'll always adore you,
I'm the one who'll catch you when you fall.

Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?

Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?
Do you care at all?
