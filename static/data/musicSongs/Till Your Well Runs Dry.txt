Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You said you loved me and then you left
Broke every promise, you won every bed
You never miss your water till your well runs dry!

[Chorus:]
Tell me, tell me what you gonna do
When your, when your well runs dry
What you gonna do, when your, when your well runs dry?
What you gonna do when your well runs dry
I'd like to know
What you gonna do when your well runs dry?

Listen to me, darling
You cheat and you lie
How you come in running
Running, wanting second try
You never miss your water
Till your well runs dry!

[Chorus:]
Tell me, tell me what you gonna do
When your, when your well runs dry
What you gonna do, when your, when your well runs dry?
What you gonna do when your well runs dry
I'd like to know
What you gonna do when your well runs dry?

Sat down and sighed
And I heard you're packing
But you said nothing
I watched you pass me by.
I know you gonna miss me
You're gonna be so blue!

[Chorus:]
Tell me, tell me what you gonna do
When your, when your well runs dry
What you gonna do, when your (feeling good?)
When your well runs dry?
What you gonna do when your well runs dry
What you gonna do, when your (feeling good?)
When your well runs dry?
What you gonna do when your well runs dry
I'd like to know
What you gonna do when your well runs dry?

You never miss you water till your well runs dry!

[Chorus:]
Tell me, tell me what you gonna do
When your, when your well runs dry
What you gonna do, when your, when your well runs dry?
What you gonna do when your well runs dry
I'd like to know
What you gonna do when your well runs dry?
What you gonna do when your well runs dry?
