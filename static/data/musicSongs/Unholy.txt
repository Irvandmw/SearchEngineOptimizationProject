Lyrics:


I'm a little drunk, I know it
I'ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I'ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else

Wake up in the middle of a breakdown (Yeah)
Have sex on the table with the take out
I'm sick of the fakin', the usin', the takin'
The people callin' me obscene
You hate me, you love me, you just wanna touch me
I'm only tryna get some peace
So let me do me

I'm a little drunk, I know it
I'ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I'ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else
So what? So is everyone else
So what? So is everyone else

I'm a little drunk, I know it
I'ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else
So what? So is everyone else
So what? So is everyone else

Yeah
