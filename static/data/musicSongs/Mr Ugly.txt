Lyrics:


Haunt my house Mr. Ugly
I know how beautiful you are
When you hold me tight
Rainbow spill the night
Tell me, are you my lucky star?

Play your guitar, my Mr. Ugly
Your melodies are so divine
Winter is spring to me
When you sing to me
You serenade this heart of mine

You donât scare me, just to look at you
Iâd crawl across the great divide
Although youâre small
To me youâre so tall
When you kiss me my heartâs open wide, oh, wide

Oh, donât make me cry, my Mr. Ugly
Cling to me, never, never, ever let me go
Make my live complete
Dance me off my feet
Tell me the things I need to know
Mr. Ugly youâre, youâre not ugly to me anymore
