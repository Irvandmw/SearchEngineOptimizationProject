Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Tossing and turning
All night long
Down in my pillow
Felt so strong
Had to get up
And write this song
Baby where do we go from here?

Can't do anything to make you see
You've been your loving was made for me
What can I do
To make you see
That with you I can't go wrong

All I do is pray
That you will come my way
No doubt about it
I've got a one track mind

You took my breath so easily
And You touched my heart so carefully
And You give your love so tenderly
And You can't do nothing wrong

I got no time for no one else
And I got no love for no one else
Cause I don't believe in no one else
With you I do belong

[Chorus:]
As far as I can see
You're the one for me
No doubt about it
I've got a one track mind

[Chorus]

You take my breath so easily
And you took my heart so carefully
And you give your love so readily
And you can't do nothing wrong

[Chorus 2x and fade]
