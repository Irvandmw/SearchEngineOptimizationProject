Oh Evan!
Thank you for bringing that lube for my pussy!
I never would've been able to
Handle your fucking four inch dick
Inside my pussy
Without that gigantic bottle of lube

Baby if you want it right now
Take my hand and I'mma show you how
We can get it all night long
No distractions
No distractions

Baby if you want it right now
Take my hand and I'mma show you how
We can get it all night long
No distractions
No distractions

And I seen this shorty walking
With a couple other girls talking
If I follow 'em for like a block
Is it stalking?
Nah just waiting for the perfect moment
To walk in
Tell a convo
Like what's up yo
Baby girl I know
You hear this all the time
But I want you to be mine
Said I want you to be mine

Baby if you want it right now
Take my hand and I'mma show you how
We can get it all night long
No distractions
No distractions

Yeah
You know the baby girl feeling me
Every time I'mma rhyme the vicinity
No beef but
They all stay grilling me
That's your fault that your girl wanna get with me
I got game like [?] watch it twist it
Then I push it to the level man

Swimming in women
Like the deep end
But then again it all depends
Baby girl are we just friends?
Because I wanna be more than that
Tell me girl where we really at
On my mind like a fitted hat
Tell you where the city at
High priced hotel cause
I'm tryna get the kitty kat
Nah, nah
I just want to get to know you
Maybe run around and show you
A life that you have never seen
A life that you have never seen

Baby if you want it right now
Take my hand and I'mma show you how
We can get it all night long
No distractions
No distractions

Baby if you want it right now
Take my hand and I'mma show you how
We can get it all night long
No distractions
No distractions

Heh
Little quick joke for y'all ya know man
All my shorties what's good [?]
Especially you momma
I'm out
I'm out
Yeah, it's Logic
