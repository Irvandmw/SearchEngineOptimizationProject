Lyrics:


This is my last time around
And I don't know where I'm bound
But I'm leavin' now, so don't look back at me
It's hard to pretend that you'd love me again
When there's nothing left inside for you to see
And I thank you for the love you've given me my friend
I don't know where I'm goin', but I won't see you again

Don't ask me how I know
But I've been here before
And the things that seem important, aren't you see
I know you don't believe in my philosophy
But I thank you for the love you've given me
So goodbye my love, I know you were my friend
I don't know where I'm goin', but I won't see you again

The love that you've given me, I thank you for my friend
I don't know where I'm goin', but I won't see you again

I know you don't believe in my philosophy
But I thank you for the love you've given me
This is my last time around
And I don't know where I'm bound
But I'm leavin' now, so don't look back at me
So goodbye my love, I know you were my friend
I don't know where I'm goin', but I won't see you again

See ya later, baby
