Lyrics:


Wake up sunshine
Open up your sleepy eyes for me
Can't have you hidin'
I've been waiting all the night
People waiting for the light
Sunshine, sunshine
Wake up sunshine
Let me feel your warm sunlight on me
Can't have you hidin'
Night was long and night was cold
But today we're one day older
Sunshine, you make my life sunshine
You know I'm talkin' to you
I know you're knowin' it too
So just stop hidin' your face
Just open your eyes
Just smile your smile
I'm talkin' to you
Wake up sunshine
Ooh it's good to have you here with me
Can't have you hidin'
Can't imagine what I'd do
But feel too lonely without you
Sunshine, sunshine
You got to wake up girl
And face the day ahead
