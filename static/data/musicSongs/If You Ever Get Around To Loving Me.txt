Lyrics:


Well you fall in love with every boy you talk to
But they always turn around and set you free
Have you ever stopped to think of what could happen
If you ever get around to loving me

Well you say they always shut you out completely
To their hearts you never seemed to hold the key
But you'd be surprised how many doors will open
If you ever get around to loving me
Loving me loving me if you ever get around to loving me

Well they made you think that happiness is coldless
And your world is dark and full of misery
I'll do anything at all to make the sunhine
If you ever get around to loving me
Loving me oh loving me if you ever get around to loving me
