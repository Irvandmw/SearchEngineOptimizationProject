Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Give me a kiss to build a dream on, 
And my imagination will thrive upon that kiss. 
Sweetheart, I ask no more than this: 
A kiss to build a dream on. 

Give me a kiss before you leave me, 
And my imagination will feed my hungry heart. 
Leave me one thing before we part, 
A kiss to build a dream on. 

When Iâm alone with my fancies, Iâll be with you, 
Weaving romances, making believe theyâre true. 

Give me your lips for just a moment, 
And my imagination will make that moment live. 
Give me what you alone can give, 
A kiss to build a dream on!
