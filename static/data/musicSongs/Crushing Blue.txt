Lyrics:


It was a Friday evening
When I felt a glimpse of love
Been dancing on the ceiling
Now I just can't get enough

Looking through your window
Feeling like a spy
You stare at me and wonder why
I came

Because of you
The world is new
Because of you
I'm feeling crushing blue

Been chasing many rainbows
Just to sense the taste of love
Was dancing where the wind blows
And my search would never stop

Standing in your doorway
Kiss away the pain
Convincing you I'm not insane

Because of you
The world is new
Because of you
I'm feeling crushing blue

They're stuck in my head
The words unsaid
For way too long
My heart has bled

Because of you
The world is new
Because of you
I'm feeling crushing blue

They're stuck in my head
The words unsaid
For way too long
My heart has bled
