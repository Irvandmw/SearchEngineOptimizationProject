Lyrics:


[Verse]
All I want is your understanding
As in the small act of affection
"Why is this my life?"
Is almost everybody's question

[Hook]
And I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind

[Verse]
I prefer peace
Wouldn't have to have one worldly possession
But essentially I'm an animal
So just what do I do with all the aggression?

[Hook]
Well I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind

[Verse]
Life is a one-way street, and if you could paint it
I'd draw myself going in the right direction
So I go all the way - like I really really know -
But the truth is I'm only guessin'

[Hook]
And I've tried
Everything but suicide
Ooh but it's crossed my mind
Just a thought

[Verse]
It's even dark in the daytime
It's not just good - it's +Great Depression+
When I was lost I even found myself
Looking in the gun's direction

[Hook]
And so I've tried
Everything but suicide
But yes - it's crossed my mind
But I'm fine
