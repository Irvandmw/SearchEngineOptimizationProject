Lyrics:


Behind the old drill hall
There's a dark dirty lane
It's got graffiti all along the wall
Some obscene, some insane
But walk the whole way along
And the wall will start to sing its song
Mmm, you'll see

Sunlight throws into relief
When it can poke through
Some locally held beliefs
"F.T.P." "F.T.Q."
And you can't let this moment pass
(Moment pass)
Without learning who's a beast and who's a grass
(Who's a grass, who's a grass)
Mmm, cos it's all here

Tired old sprayed on pledges of love and hate
Over painted with words with which I agree
But these squiggles I see
They're all Greek to me

Behind the old drill hall
There's a dark dirty lane
It's got graffiti all along the wall
Some obscene, some insane
But walk the whole way along
(Way along)
And the wall will start to sing its song
(Sing its song, sing its song)
Mmm, you'll see

And you can't let this moment pass
(Moment pass)
Without learning who's a beast and who's a grass
(Who's a grass, who's a grass)
Mmm, cos it's all here to see
