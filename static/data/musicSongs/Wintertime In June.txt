Lyrics:


"Well, you're caught, motherfucker
Went to the studio, they said you weren't there all day
Still continue to lie
I don't know why I'm fuckin' worried about it, you know what I'm saying?
But I fucked up
Don't fucking come looking for me and shit
If you're just gonna fuckin' lie to me
I don't understand what's going through your head
You wanna be with other bitches, go be with other bitches
You don't need to be with me, the fuck?
Leave me the fuck alone"

[Nate Dogg:]
Seems like wintertime in June
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg:]
Girl, I just wanna lay and chill wit'chu
You're more than a summer fling and I was wondering
Can we go back to makin' love
The way we did when I was fresh out?

Ooh, baby
Now you got a nigga stressed out
I just wanted to be cool

[Nate Dogg:]
Seems like wintertime in June
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Snoop Dogg:]
Girl, you say I just wanna hang out with my crew
But, girl, you know I'm hustlin' to bring you everything
But you act like it ain't enough
I gave a fuck but now I'm fresh out

[Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg:]
Ooh, baby
Now you got a nigga stressed out
I just wanted to be cool

[Nate Dogg:]
Seems like wintertime in June (Seems like)
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg:]
Wintertime with my baby
It's cold, bring that thang close to me like we're supposed to be
Can we go back to makin' love?
But ain't no condom left, I'm fresh out (Ooh, baby)
We can have a baby and figure the rest out
I just need you to be cool

[Nate Dogg:]
Seems like wintertime in June (Wintertime)
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon (Dark before it's noon)
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg:]
Wintertime (It will change)
With my baby (Feelings change)
Wintertime in June
I just need you to be cool
