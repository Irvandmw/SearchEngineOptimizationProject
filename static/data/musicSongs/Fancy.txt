Lyrics:


All my fellas, they be actin' jealous
They don't understand me, prolly 'cause I'm fancy, ooh, ooh
Prolly 'cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
Prolly 'cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
You would think I'm loyal, baby look so spoiled
Mommy brush this dirt off, like a own this soil
Prolly 'cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
Prolly 'cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh

Yuh, baby how I come across
Honey if you pay, I talk, prolly love the way I floss
Make you feel a type of way, fuck 'bout what you say though
Never miss a meal like Ross, 'bout to flip a mil like Ross
They don't know me 'hind closed doors, aye
You could never find me losin', I bet you the boss
But baby I'm bossy, used to be daughter, they call me mother now
Treatin' me like no other, swag underwater, bread in the butter now
Wallet, wallet in pocket, pocket
Give five to the valet and she park it, park it
No games but I'm ballin', call it crocket, crocket
I'm a target but I never shop at Target, got it?

All my fellas, they be actin' jealous
They don't understand me, prolly cause I'm fancy, ooh, ooh
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
You would think I'm loyal, baby look so spoiled
Mommy brush this dirt off, like a own this soil
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh

It get lonely at the top, I'ma stack my guap
I'ma make 'em dance, chain all on my neck
Drank all on my dress, four hunnid a pop
Lonely at the top, I'ma stack my guap
I'ma make 'em dance, chain all on my neck
Drank all on my dress, four hunnid a pop

All my fellas, they be actin' jealous
They don't understand me, prolly cause I'm fancy, ooh, ooh
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
You would think I'm loyal, baby look so spoiled
Mommy brush this dirt off, like a own this soil
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh oh ohh, uh uh, oh oh ohh
