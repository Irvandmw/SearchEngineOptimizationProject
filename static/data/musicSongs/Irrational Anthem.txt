Song Name: Irrational Anthem
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I remember wishing I was older
Always something big around the corner
But as the years go by I'm growing younger
Open eyes and head still filled with wonder
Wonder, oh, ummmmm, oh

[Chorus:]
Pledge allegiance, everybody stand up
This is our irrational anthem
We don't care if they don't understand us
This is our irrational... irrational anthem, oh, oh

Let your mind go anywhere it wants to
Make your wildest wish and watch it come true
Somehow, somewhere we forgot
Cowboys, Indians, astronauts
All the dreams that we could not hold on to

[Chorus]

'Cause nothing worse than normal
There's no fun in mundane
As everyone else gets older
I refuse to change
Weak or strong, right or wrong
Who's side are you on?

[Chorus 2x]
