Lyrics:


This very necessary, very legendary... 50
If I'm not ya favorite, I wanna know why

Niggas be stuntin, frontin, with the chrome on the Cadillac
End up hog tied, mouth gagged, get hit upside the head with the gat
Nigga where the stash at, cash at? the grams and the bricks of raw
I done told ya one time, but for the last time
Don't make me put ya brains on the floor

This is a stick up bitch, get the fuck on the floor
Buck search the bedroom, Banks hold down the door
P, What we got?

10 G's, you gotta be more
These nigga sell weight, dun they gotta have raw

Bitch, one more time, you move on the floor
And Ima hit ya and send ya ass off to the lord

Man, I seen it in my dreams, we suppose to be rich
50 this is it, I ain't feelin this shit

Spider, niggas in the hood, they said they had cash
Remind me not to listen to Yayo and Hav

D-tay and fox, billy and fame
Got us out this bitch like its a motha fuckin game

First there's one shot, then two shots
And ya laid out on the floor
Ya bleed til ya in shock and ya heart stops
And they view yo ass in the morgue
Maybe in ya next life, you'll get shit right
And this shit won't happen again
Come stunt through my hood, like its all good
And we runnin up in ya crib

Southside, tell me you miss me, tell me you love me, HAHA
It's 50, y'all already know what im about, live from London! HAHA
I'm comin back man, its my last trip through there, man I'm comin back
Know what I'm sayin? I'm a see whats left of yall niggas man
You know? a lot of funny shits been goin on in and it's been killin me, not to kill you
I'm a tell you niggas the truth right, I woulda been killed me, if I wasn't me
Ya'll niggas is sweet, and that nigga kev leek is a snitch
God damn nigga! That's why you ain't neva go to jail nigga? Ah shit
Not Kev, not cool ass Kev, ah man... fuck it!
