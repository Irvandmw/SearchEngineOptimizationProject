Lyrics:


Yeah
I was talking to God, thanking him for everything he done did for me, thanking him for everything he done gave me
I asked him why I'm so special
He told me I'm the chosen one

Bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me (Fuck what they call me)
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, I'm breaking bread, bitch, I'm balling (Bitch, I'm balling, nigga)
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, I got water dripping off me (I got water dripping off me)
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, it feel like I can walk on water (It feel like I walk on water)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus

When I pull up in that Beamer (Skrrt)
I got that.45 on my seat (Bah), I'm smoking California reefer
I'm screaming out "Fuck the police" (Fuck 'em)
I'm smashing out soon as I see 'em (Skrrt)
These niggas got nothing on me (Nah)
They make believe, I make believers (Haha)
These bitches treat me like a God (God)
I fuck them hoes two at a time (At a time)
I only put facts in my rhymes (In my rhymes)
I put that on God, I ain't lyin' (On God)
These niggas must thought I was playin' (Must thought I as playin')
Until that boy brought out them bands ('Til that boy brought out them bands)
My nigga, they crossed me again (Damn)
Feel like I lost all of my friends (Fuck 'em)
I can't even hide it no more (Damn)
It ain't no secret, I'm the truth (I'm the truth)
These niggas don't play with lil' John (Play)
And the day that they play, I'ma shoot (Bah)
These bitches, they know that you lyin' (They know that you lyin')
We see you out all of the time (See you out all of that time)
Where that foreign car that you drive? (Where it's at?)
Niggas playing tricks on your mind

Bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me (Fuck what they call me)
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, I'm breaking bread, bitch, I'm balling (Bitch, I'm balling, nigga)
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, I got water dripping off me (I got water dripping off me)
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, it feel like I can walk on water (It feel like I walk on water)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus

And it ain't shit you can tell me (Tell me)
I came up out here on my own (On my own)
I didn't need no one to help me (Nah)
Them plates keep on calling my phone (My phone)
'Cause they know Baby Jesus gon' bless 'em (Bless 'em)
A couple niggas want my dome (My dome)
'Cause that boy Baby Jesus finessed 'em
These bitches tell me I'm conceited (Conceited)
'Cause I call myself Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
But it compliment my demeanor (My demeanor)
All throughout the day, switching my sneakers
Like a king, I'ma die on this gold (Ice, ice, ice)
When you making niggas, they wanna kill ya
Seen it coming a long time ago
Before I had it, I knew I was that nigga
Back in the day before I had the clothes (Before I had the clothes)
Talkin' way before I had the hoes (Before I had the hoes)
Now these niggas they actin' surprised (Why?)
I can see jealousy in they eyes (Why?)
They tell me I'm out of my mind (Why?)
'Cause I told 'em stop calling me John (Woo)
God told me I'm here for the reason
And he gave me the name Baby Jesus

Bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me (Fuck what they call me)
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, I'm breaking bread, bitch, I'm balling (Bitch, I'm balling, nigga)
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, I got water dripping off me (I got water dripping off me)
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, it feel like I can walk on water (It feel like I walk on water)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
