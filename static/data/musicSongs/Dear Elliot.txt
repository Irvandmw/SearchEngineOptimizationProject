Lyrics:


You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us when you left that place
You didn't wanna go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you till you left, so you went away

Where'd you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about so many of my friends
Oh, about their ends

What about us?
Are we just dust on the floor again?
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in a quite a position
You got me strugglin' as a musician with a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it would solve them
But you're wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is, why must it come to this?
You talk about being strung out and how I want to be
You and your melody

Tryin' to learn about somethin' important
But you keep takin' up space, you're annoyin'
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know

Tryin' teach me 'bout new ways of livin'
You're tryin' to teach me 'bout ways of forgivin'
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say

You were not approved, but you are on the move
I care about how this turns out
It's just more than I ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't

Tell me I have to, tell me I have to
I know you could
I said, I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about
