[KRS-ONE:] Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!

[Logic:]
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"

Sellin' records on a major label
But I'm still movin' like I'm independent
Still respected like I'm independent
I'm just talkin' my shit so don't get offended
Bitch I been invented this real
Been the same since my deal
If you try to say that I'm changin'
Wait for the album, see how you feel
My third album, my Graduation like Kanye
Music on another level, yeah I'm tryna take this shit further beyond Ye
I just might fuck around and drop this shit on 'em by surprise like I'm BeyoncÃ©
Got a couple million in the bank right now
But I want my zeros beyond Jay
Counting money like Rothenberg, VC
Paid a price to be me
Ain't it nice to be me?
Ain't it nice to be free?
Do what you want when you wanna do it
On the real, it ain't nothin' to it
Young man on his Alan Watts
In a bookstore with my pocket watch
Wifey, goin' hard with the squats
Life good so they take shots
That's childish, I hate shots
I've been at it, Rattpack, get that shit tatted
Fuck with me on Snapchat
Talk shit and get clapped back
Only carry-on is my backpack
When I jetset like a war vet
What up

What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"

Everybody know I've been at it with this rap shit
Fuck around with this trap shit
But this next album is a wrap, shit
My third album, my Graduation like Kanye
Music on another level, yeah I'm tryna take this shit further beyond Ye
I just might fuck around and drop this shit on 'em by surprise like I'm BeyoncÃ©
Got a couple million in the bank right now
But I want my zeros beyond Jay
I want my zeros beyond
I want my zeros beyond Jay
That shit they talkin' beyond fake
Fact 'em right now he beyond fake
I'm a take a minute and get in it so you know I'm in it
This right here my house, you the tenant
Everything that happens, I intend it
Every word that you hear, I invented
I've been living like a king
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I've just been bumpin' that
This why your girl on a sling
That's the type of shit I bring
I'm doin' this for the fans, so they can turn up in my absence
Started a channel, already made a hundred grand off of AdSense
I ain't do it for the money though
I don't do it for the money though
Shout out to Kid Cudi though
That's the homie, you already know

What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"

I don't give a damn, I know who I am, tell 'em
I don't give a damn, I know who I am
Yeah they talkin', but I'm gettin' money for me and my fam
This shit ain't that super deep
Nah this right here just the jam
This right here the jam
This right here just the jam
This shit right here jam
This my jam
This shit here the jam
