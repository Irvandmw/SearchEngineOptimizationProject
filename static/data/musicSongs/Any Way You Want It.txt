Lyrics:


Itâs a long and lonely night
early in the morning
I can see a million lights
And many dreams are calling

Beauty as a flower
Slipping trough the walls
Am I about to lose it all
(and she says:)

[Chorus:]
Any way you want it
Anything you need
Baby youâre the master
that I want to please
Love is getting harder
with a nice tattoo
Yes I came for you
So she said

I am walking on my own
as the sun is shining
But a message on my phone
Makes my thoughts colliding

Clever conversations
get a little numb
Makes me feel that we belong to none
(and she says:)

[Chorus:]
Any way you want it
Anything you need
Baby youâre the master
that I want to please
Love is getting harder
with a nice tattoo
I had it made for you
So she said

[Release:]
I will show you something that you never tried before
Baby I will make you beg for more
Standing here preventing you from running for the door
Just touch me now â¦ anyhow

Beauty as a flower
Slipping trough the walls
Am I losing my mind
Why did I return your call
