Lyrics:


Wait till you see him, see how he looks, huh
Wait till you hear him laugh
Painters of paintings and writers of books
Well, they never could tell the half

Just wait till you feel the warmth of his glance
Pensive and sweet and wise
All of it lovely, all of it thrilling
I'll never be willing to free him

When you see him
Well, you just won't believe your eyes
