Lyrics:


It's another night, another day
It's another street, with another name
Just another storm, just another rain
But now nothing feels the same

Yesterday I thought, this was solid ground
Just another thing, I was wrong about
But I never learn, till it crash and burn
Just another textbook case of

Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home, Don't try this at home
Don't try this at home

Guess what now, I can live without
All the foolish love, people talk about
Better by myself, with no one around
But that's what I'm saying now

But that's such a lie, 'cos I know that once
I look in her eyes, fall back in love
Guess I'll never learn, till it crash and burn
Just another textbook case of

Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home, Don't try this at home
Don't try this at home

Said I was playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home, Don't try this at home
Don't try this at home

Call me crazy but I've been here before
And I promised myself that I wouldn't fall
But looking now I'm so lost
I guess I'm gonna have to learn the hard way because
I have a problem with one thing I shouldn't touch
I know that love is dangerous
But I can't keep on

Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home, Don't try this at home
Don't try this at home

Playing with fire, playing with fire
