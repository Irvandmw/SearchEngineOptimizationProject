Lyrics:


You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me 
You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me 

My dress so short it's border line killa 
I don't wanna hurt you 
I'm whole a lot of thrilla 
Looking at me say something 
Have we met somewhere before 
Playing these games I'm not about to do it 
Cause I can have him and you 
You knew it 
I'm a grown woman I could 
I got my house payed up 
And I'm all way to the end 

And when you see me in a dress and good shoes 
People looking at a moody lipsa 
Cause I'm tired of waiting I'm fading all I'm saying is 

You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me (I think it's time you be about it) 
You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me (You wants to come and see about it) 

Cause I'm alone and high heels on dressed in gabbana let's go 
Now don't you wanna know don't you wanna know 
I think I think it's time you be about it 

Me in the back of the end because I don't need everybody looking at us 
All on me but I'ma let you see our little tricks in the bag 
You wanna stare in my eyes get some time 
You about to lose it on waiting all night 
Grown woman I'm good 
Be a man come and catch me like you should 

Cause when you see me in a dress and good shoes 
People looking at a moody lipsa 
Cause I'm tired of waiting I'm fading all I'm saying is 

You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me (I think it's time you be about it) 
You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me (You wants to come and see about it) 

Cause I'm alone and high heels on dressed in gabbana let's go 
Now don't you wanna know don't you wanna know 
I think I think it's time you be about it 

Full grown woman get it if you want me 
Get your money baby I can spend it on me [x4]

You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me 
You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me (You wants to come and see about it) 
Full grown woman get it if you want me 
Get your money baby I can spend it on me 

Keep looking at me and I'm looking at you 
Keep looking at me ooh 

You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me (I think it's time you be about it) 
You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me (You wants to come and see about it) 

Cause I'm alone and high heels on dressed in gabbana let's go 
Now don't you wanna know don't you wanna know 
I think I think it's time you be about it 

You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me (I think it's time you be about it) 
You got me looking at you and now you're looking at me (You wants to come and see about it) 

Cause I'm alone and high heels on with dressed in gabbana let's go 
Now don't you wanna know don't you wanna know 
I think it's time you be about it
