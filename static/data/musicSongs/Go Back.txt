Lyrics:


The CD is over go back to track one 
And start again from there
Skinny dippin' is so much fun 
Even in your underwear 
It's cool and you just don't care 

You just don't care 
It's easy you can never be afraid 
Listen to the music cause this is what our dreams are made of 
You just gotta know ooohhh just let yourself go 
We'll see you at the show 

I'm all dressed up in the plain white t's 
And now the girls can't stop looking at me 
I got the windows down and the radio LOUD 
You can feel something in the air 
It's cool and you just don't care 

You just don't care 
It's easy you can never be afraid 
Listen to the music cause this is what our dreams are made of 
You just gotta know ooohhh just let yourself go 
We'll see you at the show 

The CD is over go back to track one 
And start again from there
Come'on over we'll so much fun 
And life will never be unfair 
And love is always in the air 
Theres always something happening there 
It's cool and you just don't care 

You just don't care 
It's easy you can never be afraid 
Listen to the music cause this is what our dreams are made of 
You just gotta know ooohhh just let yourself go 
We'll see you at the show 

You just don't care 
It's easy you can never be afraid (You can never be afraid)
Listen to the music 
Cause this is what our dreams are made of (This is what our dreams are made of)
You just gotta know (You just gotta go)
Ooohhh 
Just let yourself go (Let go)
We'll see you at the show (See you at the show, see you at the show) [x5]
