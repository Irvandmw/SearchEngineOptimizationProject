Lyrics:


If it's the last thing I do, I'll make you mine
Darling the first thing is you, in my design
Just like the stars guard the moon above me
Thats just how I'll guard our love, so love me
Please love me

If it's the last thing I do, I'll take your hand
And though I won't say a word, you'll understand
I'll build a dream just for two
And then I'll make it come true
If it's the very last thing I do

Just like the stars guard the moon above me
Thats just how I'll guard our love, so love me
Please love me

If it's the last thing I do, I'll take your hand
And though I won't say a word, you'll understand
I'll build a dream just for two
And then I'll make it come true
If it's the very last thing I do
