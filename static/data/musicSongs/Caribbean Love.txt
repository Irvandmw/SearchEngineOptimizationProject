Lyrics:


I should be in the sun
That's my kind of life
I don't want no winters cuddle by the fire
I wanna travel the world
Go so far away
I'll take on every city watching palm trees sway
Mhmm

Woah-oh-oh (Oh)
To a place that never sleeps, yeah (Yeah)
Woah-oh-oh
That's where I should be

I want Caribbean love
I wanna live on the beach
Making love by the ocean
And speak the language they speak
I like the way they say "aloha"
While they're smiling at me
The sunshine is my only drug
I want Caribbean love

I want Caribbean lo-o-o-ove, lo-o-o-ove
I want Caribbean lo-o-o-ove, lo-o-o-ove

I bought a ticket last night
I'm gonna be leaving at two
I made sure to pack my favorite bathing suit, hah
I'mma have PiÃ±a Coladas in my hand
With my toes in the sand, no worries on my mind
Listen to the band go "woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh"
That's all I wanna do, hey!

Woah-oh-oh (Oh)
To a place that never sleeps, yeah (Yeah)
Woah-oh-oh
That's where I should be

I want Caribbean love
I wanna live on the beach (Oh)
Making love by the ocean
And speak the language they speak
I like the way they say "aloha"
While they're smiling at me babe
The sunshine is my only drug
I want Caribbean love

Uh-uh, hey, hey!
Trinidad, the Bahamas or Saint Lucia
Don't really care, send me out to Costa Rica
Got a ticket and some money, I don't need no honey
Just fly me away, fly fly me away! Yuh! (Hey, hey, hey!)
To the city where the people never sleep
They be riding on the waves, and napping on the beach, yeah!
Yeah, that sounds like living to me
Ha, and that's where I should be!

(Oh) I want Caribbean love
I wanna live on the beach
And make sweet love by the ocean
Speak the language they speak
I like the way they say "aloha"
While they're smiling at me
The sunshine is my only drug
I want Caribbean love
I want Caribbean love
I wanna live on the beach
Making love by the ocean
And speak the language they speak
I like the way they say "aloha" (Aloha)
While they're smiling at me (Smiling at me)
The sunshine is my only drug (Hey, hey)
I want Caribbean love

Oh, I want Caribbean lo-o-o-ove, lo-o-o-ove (Yeah, yeah yeah)
I want Caribbean lo-o-o-ove, lo-o-o-ove
I want Caribbean love
