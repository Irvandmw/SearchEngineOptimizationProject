Lyrics:


Yeah, you're damn right, this the way I am
I'm tryna be like, no, I know that I
Didn't need it
Said, I didn't need it
I tried to do right but I lost my cool
And I don't understand why it had to be you
It got to me
I let it get to me, yeah

Maybe bringing shit up
I can't fight, and they always need a bad guy
I just laugh when I think about it
It feels like I ran out of time
And you came along, changed my life
Changed my life
And yeah, you showed me that I'm, showed me that I'm royalty

When you look at my past, I need you to understand it
Wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't part of my plan
Why you gotta go treat me like that?
Gotta be better, but you didn't like that
Wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't part of my plan

Give it up, but it wasn't enough to please you
So I'm living it up, ooh, yeah, yeah
I just don't give a fuck, ooh, yeah, yeah
Keep myself out of love, oh-oh
But you wanted a show, oh-oh
So I'm living it up, ooh, yeah, yeah
Baby, I don't give a fuck, ooh, yeah, yeah

Maybe bringing shit up
I can't fight, and they always need a bad guy
I just laugh when I think about it
It feels like I ran out of time
And you came along, changed my life
Changed my life
And yeah, you showed me that I'm, showed me that I'm royalty

When you look at my past, I need you to understand it
Wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't part of my plan
Why you gotta go treat me like that?
Gotta be better, but you didn't like that
Wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't part of my plan

Give it up, but it wasn't enough to please you
So I'm living it up, ooh, yeah, yeah
I just don't give a fuck, ooh, yeah, yeah
Keep myself out of love, oh-oh
But you wanted a show, oh-oh
So I'm living it up, ooh, yeah, yeah
Baby, I don't give a fuck, ooh, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
