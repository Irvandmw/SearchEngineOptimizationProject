Lyrics:


Pardon me, I can't hear you over the music
Ooh the way that you talk got me bout to lose it yeah (yeah)
Come on lets get up outta here (here)
And baby girl I got a feeling
That you and I are gone be leaving
I'm tired of talking so loud
And tryna rush through the crowd
I think it's time to leave now
Lets go where no one's around

Because I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
See I want to feel your breath
When you're talking sexy
So won't you let me hear you whisper

Yeah this conversation's straining
I can't hear what you're saying
So lets stop and delay it
Oh (oh) I really think it's time to go (go)
Oh and baby I'm here with a notion
That you're so over this commotion
So loud I can't even think
This girl is spilling her drink on me
And you got a thing for me
So baby lets go

Because I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
See I want to feel your breath
When you're talking sexy
So won't you let me hear you whisper (whisper, whisper)
I want you to whisper (I want you to whisper)
See I want to feel your breath
When you're talking sexy
So won't you let me hear you

See honestly my head just started ringing
And that's just the beginning
There's just so many people around
And I think that the perfect situation
Is you and I just phrasing outta here
Come on, lets go

Pardon me, I can't hear you over the music
Ooh the way that you move making me want lose it
Oh I think it's really time to go
Oh whoa

Because I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
See I want to feel your breath
When we're talking sexy
So won't you let me hear you whisper
I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
See I want to feel your breath
When you're talking sexy
So won't you let me hear you whisper (whisper)
I want you to whisper (I want you to whisper)
I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
I want you to whisper..
I want you to whisper (whisper, whisper)
I want you to whisper..
