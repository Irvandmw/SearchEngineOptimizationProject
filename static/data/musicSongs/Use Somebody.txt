Lyrics:


I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover on the street

You know that I could use somebody
Yeah you know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you (Use somebody)

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep, no
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me (oh)
Someone like me (oh)
Someone like me (use somebody)
You know that I could use somebody

I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
