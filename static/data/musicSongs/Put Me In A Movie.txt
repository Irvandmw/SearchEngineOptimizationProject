Lyrics:


Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
If he likes me, takes me home
Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
If he likes me, takes me home
Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
If he likes me, takes me home

Come on, you know you like (good) little girls
Come on, you know you like (good) little girls
You can be my daddy
You can be my daddy

Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
He didnât know heâd have this much fun
Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
He didnât know heâd have this much fun
Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
He didnât know heâd have this much fun

Come on, you know you like (good) little girls
Come on, you know you like (good) little girls
You can be my daddy
You can be my daddy

You're my little sparkle jump rope queen
You're my little sparkle
You're my little sparkle jump rope queen
You're my little sparkle

Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
You know I canât make it on my own

Put me in a movie
Put me in a movie
You can be my daddy
You can be my daddy
Put me in a movie
You can be my daddy
