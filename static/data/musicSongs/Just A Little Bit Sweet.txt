Lyrics:


If you'd be just a little bit sweet to me
You'd be surprised how happy this boy would be
If you'd try to stop your messin' around and flirtin'
Maybe my heart'd stop hurtn'
'Cause you know pretty baby
That your daddy's still in love with you

If you knew how it breaks my heart in two
Everytime I see someone else with you
If you'd stop your runnin' 'round and swingin'
Give the bells a chance to start ringin'
'Cause you know pretty baby
That your daddy's still in love with you

You're so fine
And I need you to be mine
'Cause you know pretty baby
That no body else will do

If you'd be just a little bit sweet to me
You'd be surprised how good true love could be
If you'd try me just a little bit longer
Maybe our love will grow stronger
'Cause you know pretty baby
That your daddy's still in love with you

Come on, come on, come on
Stop all your messin' 'round and swingin'
Give the bells a chance to start ringin'
'Cause you know pretty baby
That your daddy's still in love with you
