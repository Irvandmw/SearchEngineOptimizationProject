Lyrics:


Oh what a beautiful night
The stars are shining bright
I've not been feeling right
Not been feeling right
I've not been feeling right
Soon it's gonna change
Time to rearrange
Stop this acting strange
Found us a beautiful place
Perfect and tiny space
And now we can retrace
Now we can retrace
Now we can retrace
All we have begun
New oblivion
Havin' lots of fun
Guitar
Got to get back inside
Dreams and thoughts collide
Say you found this crazy
Say you found this crazy
Say you found this crazy
Life
Please be good to me
Last chance to be free
This mountain majesty is rediscovery
