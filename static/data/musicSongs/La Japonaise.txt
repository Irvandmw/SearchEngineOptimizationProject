Lyrics:


I feel the power of the stranger inside me
A force of magic surrounds me
This fountain within me is overflowing

Peaceful and inviting, beautiful and enticing

Rising sun will bless my morning with a smile
A magic pearl from the seas, born in a willow breeze
Loyal friend my guardian angel in the sky
You've served me well all these years
Greeting with both hands, trusting with no fears, till the end

When everything is golden and everything is oh
And everything is ah
My only living treasure on this earth

When everything is golden, everything and everyone is ah
