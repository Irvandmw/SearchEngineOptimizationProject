Lyrics:


I was scatterbrained 
When I found the time to find 
That times are evil 
Sick and disjointed 
My skin is thick 
Thick and calloused 
I'm ready to shed the shell 
Ready to shed the shell 

So you think you have figured me out 
A young man lost in his problems 
Some problems aren't that easy to solve 
And you can't break our code of energy 

I'm bent out of shape 
There is no happy ending 
I've come to a point 
Where I just don't give a fuck 
My skin is thick 
Thick and calloused 
I'm ready to shed the shell 
Ready to shed the shell 

The code of energy 

Hi 
I'm paranoid 
Goodbye 
I'm in the void 
Haunted by insecurity 
Bipolar asymmetry 

Our new vision of passion and obsession 
Is planetary ingestion 
There is no time for question.....
