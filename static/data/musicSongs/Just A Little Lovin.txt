Lyrics:


(Just a little lovin' will go a long way, long, long way.)

Just a little lovin' will go a long way
And you will make me happy the rest of my days
Put your arms around me then I'll be your slave
'Cause just a little lovin' will go a long way.

(A little lovin' go a long way
Make me happy the rest of my days
Arms around me be your slave
A little lovin' go a long way.)

(Just a little lovin') will go a long way
And you will make me happy oh the rest of my days
Put your arms around me then I'll be your slave
'Cause just a little lovin' will go a long way.

(Just a little lovin') will go a long way...
