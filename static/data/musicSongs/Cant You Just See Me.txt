Lyrics:


Can't you just see me
With my head in the air
The day you trip and fall
Right out of my hair

I'm gonna walk right by you
Like you were stone
Everything that I felt for you, baby
Will be dead and gone

Hey, can't you just see me
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me, girl
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me now
(Can't you just see her)
With my head in the air
(With her head in the air)

Hey, can't you just see me
With another man
Just a-hugging and a-kissing
And him holding my hand

I'm gonna feel so happy
Just paying you back
For the times that you hurt me, baby
By doing you just like that

Oh, can't you just see me
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me now
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me, girl
(Can't you just see her)
With my head in the air
(With her head in the air)

Can't you just see me
(Can't you just see her)
Ooh, can't you just see me now
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me, girl
(Can't you just see her)
With my head in the air
(With her head in the air)

I wanna look in your eyes
(Can't you just see her)
And see a whole lotta tears
(Can't you just see her)
You know that you done me bad
(Can't you just see her)
For a whole lotta years
(Can't you just see her)
And I might slap your face
(Can't you just see her)
All over the place
(Can't you just see her)
Ooh, can't you just
Can't you just, can't you just
Can't you just see me now...
