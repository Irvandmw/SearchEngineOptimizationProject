Lyrics:


Well I was sitting at a bar it was late at night
And the darkness is all around
Then a good looking thing, like I've never seen before
Walked in and he melted me down
When I looked at me and the fire from his eyes
Stomped over and touched my skin
I said oh my lord, won't you help me hang on
Cause here I go again

He's a devil in disguise and he'll love you blind
And he'll leave you sad and going out of your mind
Wondering if there'll ever be another day that you see him return
But a foolish girl, she don't understand
That you don't mess around with that kind of man
If you play with a devil like that then you're gonna get burned

Well he walked over to me, and he asked me straight out
Hey baby do you wanna dance
So I held on really tight, hoping this would be
My night for a little romance
When the song was over, he took me by the hand
And he swept me right off of my feet
Then he loved me in the night, burning out of control
And I couldn't leave us be

He's a devil in disguise and he'll love you blind
Then he'll leave you crazy, going out of your mind
Wondering if there'll ever be another day that you see him return
And a foolish girl, she don't ever understand
That you can't mess around with that kind of man
Cause if you're messing with a devil like that then you're gonna get burned

He's a devil in disguise and he'll love you blind
Then he'll make you crazy, going out of your mind
Wondering if there'll ever be another day that you see him return
And a foolish girl, don't ever understand
That you don't mess around with that kind of man
Cause if you mess with a devil like that then you're gonna get burned

He's a devil in disguise and he'll rob you blind
Then he'll leave you standing, going out of your mind
Wondering if there'll ever be another day that you see him return
