[Yo Gotti & DaBaby:]
Gotti, yeah
Glacier
Baby
I am
Yeah (Firzt on the track)
Yeah

[DaBaby:]
I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we gon' divide it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)
I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (What you got? Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we gon' divide it (Ayo)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)

[Yo Gotti:]
I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (Froze)
The ice on my neck so cold, it fucks up the climate (Ho)
The check on my wrist, put check on my bitch, I'm shining (I am)
Lost track of the time 'cause I'm in the trap just grinding
I got flawless stones, your shit flawed (flawed) and you flawed too
I'm a millionaire but since you pussy, I may rob you (Pussy)
All this money, there ain't enough (Enough)
Ain't the nigga you should trust (Trust)
Got your baby mama on a bus (Bus)
And she a diamond in the rough (My nigga)

[DaBaby:]
I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we gon' divide it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)
I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (What you got? Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we gon' divide it (Ayo)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)

So much gold wrapped 'round my neck, I look like Mr. T (Ayy)
I say this with all due respect, you not fuckin' with me (No)
I need somebody to help me, I'm havin' a problem (Hey)
Like should I just put on my gold, or should I wear the diamonds? (Diam')
When I pull up on them hoes, I got all of 'em smilin' (Skrrt)
Run up that check with my bros and then we gon' divide it (Break)
I promise that I'll never fold, 'cause a young nigga solid
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
And wherever a young nigga go, I'ma always be shinin' (Hey)

I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we gon' divide it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)
I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (What you got? Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we gon' divide it (Ayo)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)

[Yo Gotti:]
Glacier ice
Glacier, ice
Glacier, ice
