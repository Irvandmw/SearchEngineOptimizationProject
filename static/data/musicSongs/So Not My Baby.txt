Lyrics:


There's so many things that I need to do
Seems like nothing gets done when I'm feeling so blue
And it's so hard to handle this absolute truth
That you're so not around and I'm so into you

[Chorus:]
You're so not my baby, it's making me crazy
It's breaking my heart and my world half in two
You're so not my baby, hey, I should be okay
But you know what, I'm so not over you

I keep ringing and ringing your old telephone
Seems like the more that it rings, the more that you're gone
I oughta hang up and just let you go
But a voice in my heart keeps saying hello

[Chorus:]

I've been searching and searching but it just gets me down
'Cause your love and affection is nowhere to be found

[Chorus:]

Know what, I'm so not over you
So not my baby
