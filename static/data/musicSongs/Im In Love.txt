Lyrics:


(Love, love, love, love)
Iâm in love, yes I am
Iâm in love, yes I am, uh
Iâm in love, hey baby, hey, you know I am
Iâm in love, uh, huh, you know I am

Friends all wonder whatâs come over me
Iâm as happy as any girl could be
(Love, love, love) Iâm in love
(Love, love, love) Believe me I am
(Love, love, love) Iâm in love, oh
(Love, love, love) Yes sir I am, yes sir I am, yes sir I am
(Love, love, love) Hoo, whoa, whoa, whoa
(Love, love, love) Iâm in love

And Iâm so glad that itâs me who had to change
Iâm sproutinâ and bloominâ like the last summer rose
(Love, love, love) Iâm in love
(Love, love, love) Iâm in love, Iâm in love, Iâm in love, Iâm in love
(Love, love, love) Iâm in love, Iâm in
(Love, love, love)

Iâm in love
(Love, in love, in love)  
In the morninâ
(In love, in love, in love, in love)  
I wake up smilinâ and shininâ
(Love, in love, in love) Iâm in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)  
Smilinâ like love I know where itâs at
(Love, in love, in love) Iâm in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)  
Iâm in love
(Love, in love, in love) Iâm in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)  Yes I am
(Love, in love, in love) Um, Iâm in love
