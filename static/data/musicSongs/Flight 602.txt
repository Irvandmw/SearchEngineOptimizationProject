Lyrics:


You are on a plane now
And on you way up north
Canada is so far from where you want to be
Be in California, with sunshine in your heart
But you know ther are people
That you have to be
Have to be
Have to be what they say you are
What you always wanted to be
Wanted to be
Wanted to be just a man fulfilled
But a little more free
A little more free
You are in a hotel
And in your room alone
Lying there, but not knowing where you're s'posed to be
Be thinking of B-3's and Leslies going round
And you know there are people
That are going to be
Goin' to be
Goin' to see what they say you are
What you've always wanted to be
Wanted to be
I only wanted to be just a man fulfilled
But a little more free
A little more free
A little more free
