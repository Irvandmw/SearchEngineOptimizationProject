Lyrics:


[Drake:]
You could thank me now
uh, go âhead
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesnât always come so instead
itâs okay,
You could thank me now
uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go

[Verse 1:]
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
lately Iâve been drinking like thereâs a message in a bottle
alohaâs to women with no ties
to men that I know well
that way there are no lies
you could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
Iâm on the brink of influential
Iâm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesnât add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch,
what a year for you niggas
itâs December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
you got the resolutions, we just got reservations
living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
and we just wanna party, patron straight up
fuck that old shit, Iâm on new things
OVO clique, Red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
whoâd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
I could relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival
damn, I swear sports and music are so synonomous
âcause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
yeah so on behalf of the demanded
and the entertainment that you take for granted
you could thank me now...
and oh my goodness youâre welcome
youâre welcome
at this point me is who Iâm trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
but drink up because everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
yeah, thats how you know itâs going down
in case another chance never comes around...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think Iâm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isnât realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
that make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
but do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latteâs
and low fat muffinâs, do I?
Or is missing what we had outta the question
Iâm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroeâs whoâs there before it all
I guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons or focus on your proâs
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will grow
into women that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allow
where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching so Iâm trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning
youâll find it next to me
and tell me Iâm the highest, guess we finally get to see
Iâm feeling like Nas who am I to disagree
they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
itâs probably why Iâm in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
Iâm sorry, poolside drinking
margharita rounds
shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
Iâm the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown
and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
Iâm in the world where things are taken, never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and Iâm aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while Iâm still here in this position...

[Chorus]
