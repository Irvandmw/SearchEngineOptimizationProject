Lyrics:


I really don't feel like talking on the phone
And I really don't feel like company at home
Lately I don't wanna do the things I used to do
Baby since I lost you

And I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you babe yeah
It's driving me crazy, crazy

I really don't feel like smiling anymore
And I haven't had the peace to sleep at all
Ever since you went away
Baby my whole life has changed
I don't wanna love and I don't wanna live

And I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you babe no way
It's driving me crazy, crazy

I don't wanna laugh, I don't wanna play
I don't wanna talk, have nothing to say
I don't wanna tour,
Forget this show
How can I go on
Now that you are gone?

I don't want to (baby) sing another love song babe
And I don't want to (no way) hum another melody
And I don't want to live my life (no way) without you babe
(I don't give a damn about nothing, baby)
It's driving me crazy
(Without you by my side)

I don't want to sing another love song babe
And I don't want to (no way) hum another melody
And I don't want to (live my life) live my life (no way) without you babe
(Baby since you've been gone)
It's driving me crazy
(I've been so all alone)

I don't want (come back) to (to me) sing another (I need some you by) love song babe
And I don't want...
