Lyrics:


I want to watch you cross the room
Be the one you're walking to
See our shadows fall
Down this bedroom wall in neon blue

I want to know your darkest fears
Taste surrender in your tears
Hold you down until
It's not against your will time just dies right here

Touch me like you can't let go
Burn into me soft and slow
Prove to me you're not pretending
Kiss me like the world is ending

Yeah yeah yeah

I want our souls to both confess
As if there are only seconds left
Finally just admit
that when it comes to this, we're powerless

Touch me like you can't let go
Burn into me soft and slow
Prove to me you're not pretending
Kiss me like the world is ending

I want you to set your devil free
Til there's barely nothing left of me
Except for whispering
That you are everything... eternally

Touch me like you can't let go
Burn into me soft and slow
Prove to me you're not pretending
Kiss me like the world is ending

Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
