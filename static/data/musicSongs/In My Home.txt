Lyrics:


In my home
All alone
The things I flee always find me
But they can tell
All is well
'Cos truth and lies never bind me

And I know, sweet love
Is gentle and tough
But for me, sweet love
Was never enough

In my home
All alone
The things I flee always find me

And I know, sweet love
Is gentle and tough
But for me, sweet love
Was never enough

In my home
All alone
The things I flee always find me
But they can tell
All is well
'Cos truth and lies never bind me

Truth and lies never bind me
