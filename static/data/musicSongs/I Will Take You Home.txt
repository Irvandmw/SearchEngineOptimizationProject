Lyrics:


I stole a car last night,
Don't know where we're gonna go
But go ahead and drive
I will take you home

Honey, it's cold outside
And your jumper's torn
But, darling, hold on tight
I will keep you warm

And we will cry till this fire is drowned
And we will write all our memories down
And we will drive till these tires wear out
But darling IâI will take you home

If we could drive all night
Until the sun is shone up
I'll see it in your eyes, yeah
They will take me home

Honey, it's so damn bright,
Daylight's taken over again
Just follow the signs (ooh ooh)
They will lead us home

And we will cry till this fire is drowned
And we will write all our memories down
And we will drive till these tires wear out
But darling I, I will take you home

And we will drive till these tires wear out
And we will write all our memories down
And we will cry till this fire is drowned

But, darling, IâI will keep you warm
Oh, darling, IâI will keep you warm
(and) darling, IâI will take you home
