Lyrics:


Don't leave me here
I'm a stranger in a foreign land
Will you help me make a stand
Don't leave me here

Don't pass me by
I'm a sailor on a darker sea
Can you shine a light on me
Don't leave me here

I know life's an open road
And who knows where it leads you
But there's someone here who needs you
If you find your way back home

I know life's an open road
And who knows where it leads you
But there's someone here who needs you
If you find your way back home

Don't leave me here
After all the things that we've been through
Can I be a part of you is there part of you to spare
Don't leave me here
Don't leave me here
