Lyrics:


[Chorus:]
Like a buncha blind people playing tic tac toe
Who knows where the zeroes & the x's go?
Like a buncha blind people playing tic tac toe
Who knows where the zeroes & the x's go?

Just like sweet November here comes a pretender
Borderline half-castle tell me nothing else & please don't ask
Listen woman I swear if u put another streak in your hair
Change it 1 more time while uncleleopusha just stares & stares

[Chorus]

If u ever get the chance 2 travel back 2 ancient dance
Tell this balletina that I wish her well & happy romance
I'm doing much better than I was when she got me high
Trying 2 rely on how many layers I should strip & y

[Chorus]

In simpler terms the tictac that I told u down below
Made your womanly obligations better than u know
After which wide open eyes that previously were closed
Saw the past & other things about u better left untold

Like a buncha blind people playing tic tac toe
Who knows where the zeroes & the x's go?
Off in2 the deepwater catastrophic down below
