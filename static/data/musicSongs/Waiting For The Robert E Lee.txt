Lyrics:


Way down on the levee in old Alabamy
There's daddy and mammy, there's Efran and Sammy
On a moonlight night you can find them all
While they are waiting the banjos are syncopating
What's that they're saying, what's that they're saying
Well while they keep playing I'm humming and swaying
It's the good ship Robert E. Lee that's come to carry the cotton away

Watch them shuffle along
See them shuffle along
Oh take your best gal real pal go down to the levee
I said the levee
Join the shuffling throng
Hear the music and song
It's simply great mate waiting on the levee
Waiting for the Robert E. Lee

Whistles are blowing smokestacks are showing
The ropes they are throwing, excuse me I'm going
To the place where all is harmonious
Even the preacher they say is the dancing teacher
Have you been down there say were you around there
If you ever go there you'll always be found there
Why doggone here comes my baby on the good ship Robert E. Lee

Watch them shuffle along
See them shuffle along
Oh take your best gal your real pal go down to the levee
I said the levee
Join the shuffling throng
Hear the music and song
It's simply great mate waiting on the levee
Waiting for the Robert E. Lee
