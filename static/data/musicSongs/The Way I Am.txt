Lyrics:


Maybe Imma get a little anxious
Maybe Imma get a little shy
Cuz everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide

All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

And that's OK
I promise myself one day

Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am

That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

Maybe Imma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore
Feeling like I really don't deserve this
Life ain't nothing like it was before

Cuz all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface
Baby I'm a little insecure

And that's OK
I promise myself one day

Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me (hate me) or love me (love me)
But that's just the way I am

That's just the way I am (I am)
That's just the way I am (I am)
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me (hate me) or love me (love me)
But that's just the way I am, am, a-a-a-a-am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted
I am, am, a-a-a-a-am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted all along

Everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide

Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me (hate me) or love me (love me)
But that's just the way I am

That's just the way I am (Maybe Imma get a little anxious)
That's just the way I am (Maybe Imma get a little scared)
That's just the way I am (Cuz everybody's trying to be famous)
That's just the way I am

Imma tell em' all (That's just the way I am)
Imma tell em' all that (That's just the way I am)
You could either hate me or love me (That's just the way I am)
But that's just the way I am
