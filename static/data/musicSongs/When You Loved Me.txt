Lyrics:


I'm back at the corner
Where we said goodbye
I turn and I see you
But don't trust my eyes

You look at me
And I can't breathe

Had every word perfect
For when this day would come
I'm standing here, now I
Can't find even one

All I want to say
Is written on my face

I close my eyes every time I wake up
'Cause every little thing makes me think of
When you loved me, when you loved me
I don't really want to talk about the weather
The truth is that I was better
When you loved me, when you loved me

I'm sure that there's somewhere
That you gotta go
Give me one more minute
One more memory to hold

And wherever you're going to
Take this with you

I close my eyes every time I wake up
'Cause every little thing makes me think of
When you loved me, when you loved me
I don't really want to talk about the weather
The truth is that I was better
When you loved me, when you loved me

I try to wish you away
You're gone today but you'll be back tomorrow
This lie that I call goodbye won't let go
Won't let me go

I close my eyes every time I wake up
'Cause every little thing makes me think of
When you loved me, when you loved me
I don't really want to talk about the weather
The truth is I'll never be better than
When you loved me, when you loved me

I'm back at the corner
Where we said goodbye
