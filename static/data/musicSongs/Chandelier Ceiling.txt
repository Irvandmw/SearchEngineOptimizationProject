Lyrics:


[Chorus: x2]
Candy coated bending corners still still wheeling
Candy candy coated bending corners still still wheeling
Candy candy coated bending corners still still wheeling
Made a killing off a bumper grillin, chandelier ceiling

[Verse 1:]
Now let me roll my sleeve up
While you go get your g's up
I'm a boss I cut ya off if I think you a skeemer
Had to get my team up and had to get my cream up
Plus that woo had told ya that cash rule everything huh
Heffer like katrina nah we don't wait for fema
We get back up on our feet and slab a candy beamer
I can't be no dreamer and plus my girl a diva
Keep her happy in that nappy wet as a aquafina
I'm starching from the cleaners
Plus I'm gripping real wood
We repped that before pimp died
And I feel like we still should
Show em how the grill look
Them swangers on the wheel shook
Get the chips and purchase whips because it make me feel good
I be like

[Chorus]
[Over chorus: Chamillionaire]
Talkin bout
Talkin bout
I'm bending corners on the mayne

[Verse 2:]
I got some good advice for ya
If they get a mike for ya
Make it fo these boys who drop the syrup and the sprite sodas
Screwed up southern type flowers
Say that he a dice roller
Just be careful this ain't something you should bet ya life over
Hope the lizard geicko ya
Cause you better be insured
You gon come to texas with that then you better be for sure
You should hear that kitty pur
No this is not for her
You can't even see the piece that's right my chest look like a blur
Got you critics choppin, got my weapon cocked in
It's not even in the spot I'm sposed to hav it locked in
Caddy that I'm droppin, make you erase your top ten
That's if you talking cars or brauds whatever I got options
I'm in my

[Chorus]
[Over chorus: Chamillionaire]
Talkin bout
Talkin bout
I'm bending corners on the mayne
Talkin bout
Talkin bout
Chandelier ceiling

[Break:]
Wanna be a baller, shot caller
20 inch blades, on a impala
Southside we roll on choppers, talkin bout

Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
25 lighters on my dresser, dresser
Do the southside, southside, maynnne talkin bout
Diamonds all in your face

[Verse 3:]
Now what the hell ya mean to trick
Texas too legit
Plus I got my hammer case a jacker wanna trip
Leanin on the switch, seated on the stitch
Hit that waffle house and get completed with the grits
Yella think she slick
Gotta be that maganum
Horses under the hood and maybe on the range like jazz n em
Swicthes just be taddilin, mad because we slabbin em
When ya super coat em there ain't nothin you can add to them
I be rolling

[Chorus]
[Over chorus: Chamillionaire]
Talkin bout
Talkin bout
I'm bending corners on em mayne
Talkin bout
Talkin bout
I'm bending corners on em mayne
