Lyrics:


It's twilight on the prairie and the moon will soon be high 
she'll be hurting every star up in the sky 
we'll lope along to dreamland and we'll bid each care goodbye 
while the wind blows through the sagebrush with a sigh! 

So hush (So, hush!) little darlin' shh  
little dear, go to sleep little darlin', I'm right here 
let my shoulder be your pillow, you'll be safe as you can be  
little darlin' you mean all the world to me 
we'll always be together and I promise faithfully  
that your dreams will all come true, just wait an' see 

So hush (So, hush!) little darlin' shh  
little dear, go to sleep little darlin', I'm right here 
(we will always be together) and I promise faithfully  
that your dreams will all come true, just you wait an' see 

So hush, little darlin' shh  
little dear, go to sleep little darlin', I'm right here...
