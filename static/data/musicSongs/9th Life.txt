Lyrics:


Thisâll be my 9th life
Hey, hey
Thisâll be my 9th life

I fall down and I blackout
Iâm a closed down
Iâm a zombie in my head
Iâm an earthquake
Make the world shake
And I wonât break
You canât kill the living dead

Because I shot once
And I shot twice
And I died three times
Iâm still standing here

Here we go again
Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be the last word
And here we are
Hanging on my last tie
Living just to die
I lost the castle, kept the crown
I built this house to burn it down tonight
Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be my 9th life

Thisâll be my 9th life
9th life

I spit blood like a flashflood
Than I rise up
No youâll never keep me down
Iâm a freight train
Burning in flames
Iâve got no shame
And Iâm crashing through your town

Because I died once
And I died twice
And Iâd died three times
Iâm still standing here

Here we go again
Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be the last word
And here we are
Hanging on my last tie
Living just to die
I lost the castle, kept the crown
I built this house to burn it down tonight
Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be my 9th life

Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be my 9th life
Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be my 9th life
Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be my 9th life
Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be my 9th life

Here we go again
Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be the last word
And here we are
Hanging on my last tie
Living just to die
I lost the castle, kept the crown
I built this house to burn it down tonight
Thisâll be the last time
Thisâll be my 9th life
