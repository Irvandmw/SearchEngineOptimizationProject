Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I love you so much I have to say it twice
Just incase you didn't hear me the first time
You are the most beautiful girl I ever laid my eyes on
And I wish you'd let me call you mine

Love might be no trouble at all
Love might make you hear double if you fall
Love might be no trouble this night
Love might make you stutter when its right

Tell me what your thinking
With no delay (Delay)

Do I even stand a chance to score a date
(Double, date)

I feel so damned crazy
My poor heart could break
That's why I sing love songs
Everyday
Everyday

Love might be no trouble at all
Love might make you hear double if you fall

Love might be no trouble this night (That's right)
Love might make you stutter when its right

But love might make you stutter when its right

But love might make you stutter when its right
