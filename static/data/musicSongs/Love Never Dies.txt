Lyrics:


You say you saw the dark side
Baby I know
It Gets you through the night
and love is like a red rose baby and so
It's coming around again
If we can take the same direction we'll find
the road that never ends
but love never dies
it goes on forever love never dies
love never dies it goes on forever

This is the love you've been talking about
you led her in till she couldn't get out
you made the little girl cry
no sad stories to deny

I go through holy war for you baby you know
you say you ain't got a prayer
I'll answer if you call for me
baby i'm yours
To God above i swear
I only wanna live in the shadow you make
the soul never lies
but love never dies it goes on forever
love never dies, love never dies
It goes on forever

You better run to the heart of the flame
she don't change like the sun in the rain
she don't understand why
you made the little girl cry

Love never dies, it goes on forever love never dies
love never dies it goes on forever

this is the love you've been talking about
you led her in till she couldn't get out
you made the little girl cry
no sad stories to deny
you better run to the heart of the flame
she don't change like the sun in the rain 
she don't understand why
you made the little girl cry
[repeat fade]
