Lyrics:


I think of all the things I promised you
There's still so many things I didn't do
I know it hasn't been the way that you expected it to be
But I need you girl don't give up on me

It never crossed my mind what you go through
For giving me each time for hurting you
I guess a foolish man just takes for granted that's how it should be
But I need you girl don't give up on me

You make up for all the bad in me with all the good in you
All the wrong I've ever had in me can't match the good in you
So maybe given time I'll come around to what I oughta be
But I need you girl don't give up on me

So maybe given time I'll come around to what I oughta be
But I need you girl don't give up on me
