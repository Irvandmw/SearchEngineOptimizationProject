(That ain't the baby, that's my baby)

I was just twenty-two inside the condo
Got way to hot I put the beamer up
I had the yellow seven forty-five with rims and my lil bruh had the beamer truck
My niece's get good grades I take em shopping for outfits and tell em to keep it up
Then I hit the backstreet and pick your bitch
Up and bent her over and beat her up (ugh)

Your bitch is a dog need a leash or sum (rrrr)
She Suckin' on me like a leech or sum (ugh)
I Just sent her home in a cab (get on)
I told the arab keep the meter running (yah)
I run thru hoes and get rid of em (get rid of em)
Fuck all my haters I shit on em
And he say that he want some pounds (oh yeah)
I pulled up on him with like 10 of em
My name hold weight with alot of niggas (weight)
I got so much weight I could sit on it (ah)
I turn good girls into freaks (freak)
When they give me head make em' spit on it
Fuck all my haters I shit on em
I fuck the same hoes used to shit on me (ah)
And I'll slap the shit out a lil nigga (bitch)
And I make him go get his big homie (ah)
My nigga dangerous and he need to work on his anger but that's still my nigga tho
My niggas so real that if I was a bitch then they woulda robbed me couple years ago (ah ha)
I'm Chillin' with my baby mama wit a big 40 eating a big bowl of cereal (boom)
Just got in a argument she brought me frosted flakes I thought I asked her for cheerios

I was just twenty-two inside the condo
Got way to hot I put the beamer up
I had the yellow seven forty-five with rims and my lil bruh had the beamer truck
My niece's get good grades, I take em shopping for outfits and tell em to keep it up
Then I hit the backstreet and pick your bitch
Up and bent her over and beat her up (ugh)
