Lyrics:


I didn't mean to leave you
But I had to go
If changing my life would make you happy
Tell me and I'll make it so, oh

I wanna make you happy
I'll do whatever you say
And if it'll make you happy, girl
I'll come home right away

I'll give you all my money
If that'll make you smile
And if you're lonely, I'll come home, baby
All you gotta do is dial, oh

I really love you, baby
No matter what your friends may say
And if it'll make you happy, girl
I'll come home right away, oh

You can stay in my house, baby
You can sleep in my bed
And if you want, I'll send you my body
You can sleep on it instead, oh

I don't dig to leave you
Leave you all alone
What's more, I really don't dig making love
Making love on a telephone, oh

I really love you, baby
No matter what they say
And if it'll make you happy, girl
I'll come home right away (play the song, now, yeah)

Oh, no, no, no
I'll come home right away

I didn't mean to leave you
But I had to go
If changing my life would make you happy
Tell me, and I'll make it so

I wanna make you happy
I'll do whatever you say
If it'll make you happy, babe
I'll come home right away, oh

I really love you, baby
No matter what your friends may say
And if it'll make you happy, girl
I'll come home right away, oh

I really love you, baby
No matter what your friends may say
I'll come home right away
I really love you, baby
No matter what your friends may say
If it'll make you happy
I'll come home right away, ooh
I really love you, baby
No matter what your friends may say
If it'll make you happy, babe
I'll come home right away, ooh
I really love you, baby (oooh)
No matter what your friends may say
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
I'll come home right away
I really love you, baby
No matter what your friends may say
If it'll make you happy, babe
I'll come home right away
I really love you, baby
No matter what your friends may say
If it'll make you happy
I'll come right away
