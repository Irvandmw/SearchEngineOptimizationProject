Lyrics:


Across the miles
It's funny to me
How far you are
But how near you seem to be

I could talk all night
Just to hear you breathe
I could spend my life
Just living this dream

You're all I'll ever need

You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love
Someone to hold

When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close

With all the lovers
I used to know
I kept my distance
I never let go

But in your arms
I know I'm safe
'Cause I've never been held
And I've never been kissed in this way

You're all I'll ever need
You're all I'll ever need

'Cause you give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love
Someone to hold

When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close

Close enough to see it's true
Close enough to trust in you
Closer now than any words can say

And when
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close

You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love
Someone to hold

When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been
I've never been
Oh no I swear
I've never been
I've never been this close
