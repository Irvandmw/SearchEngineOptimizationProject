Lyrics:


Maybe it's just me but I don't think that it is
Possible for me to continue like this, OH
I feel so insecure
Every time you walk away
And I'm never really sure how long you gonna stay

[Chorus:]
Maybe it's all in my head
I feel like leaving but I don't really want to
But, I feel so mislead
A kiss through the phone just won't do No

Cause from my point of view
I gotta say there's something bout you
So tell me babe
Cause somewhere down the road
Cause somewhere down the road
I think you lost it all
Now, It's all in my head
All in my head [X3]

You know its not my style
To start a fight and make a scene
But it's different this time
I am not a drama fiend
Maybe it's just me, 
This is how I feel
This can't simply be
Another case of jealousy

[Repeat Chorus]

I mean we can talk it out
Tell that its alright
But alright just wont do anymore, NO
I mean we can kiss and make up
Tell that its enough
But enough just wont do anymore

[Repeat Chorus]
