Lyrics:


You've got me tangled up in you
You've got me tangled up in you

I must be tripping it's true
I'm losing hold of my cool
And I really ought to let you go
Don't even make any sense
It's getting crazy intense
Why you wanna make me lose control

I just gotaa let you know
I can't seem to let you go
Now its getting perosnal

Girl what you do to me
It's crazy new to me
It's getting through to me

[Chorus]
I can't deny that its true
You've got me tangles up in you
I tell myself that it's wrong
That when you smile at me i'm gone
(gone gone gone)
There ain't no way to esacpe
Trapped in this beautiful mistake
The situation ain't cool
You've got me tangled up in you
(tangled up in you baby)

You've got me tangled up in you
You've got me tangled up in you

You're playing games with my head
I should be leaving instead
But I'm falling faster all the time
You lick your lips and you smile
I'm helpless just like a child
And i'm trying not to cross the line

I just gotta let you know
I can't seem to let you go
Now it's getting personal
Girl what you do to me
It's crazy new to me
It's getting through to me

[Chorus]

It's wrong that I just can't walk away
It's wrong that I can't find words to say
You know that you've got me hypnotised
I'm mesmerized love's in your eyes [x2]
