Lyrics:


When the sun's too hot, and my old man's not
Well I stumble outside the door
And I'm asking myself if I haven't been through all this
To darn many times before
I gave up singing my half done songs
When the money ran out before the rhymes
And I gave up loving my one sided lungs
When I couldn't believe in them lies

I used to think it was easy honey
I used to think it was alright
I used to think it was simple enough
Till scratching my way became my way of life
I used to think it was easy honey
I used to think it was alright
I used to think it was simple enough
Till scratching my way became my way of life

Well the night's far along, my old man's out somewhere gone
And I'm thinking it's time for me to go
I never loved him like he wanted me to
That's something he must already know
Look the night is cold, my shoes are old
And I don't much like the rain
And his bed's much softer, and the road is long
So I might stay on it then

I used to think it was easy honey
I used to think it was alright
I used to think it was simple enough
Till scratching my way became my way of life
I used to think it was easy honey
I used to think it was alright
I used to think it was simple enough
Till scratching my way became my way of life

I used to think it was easy honey
Yeah, I used to think it was alright
I used to think it was simple enough
Till scratching my way became my way of life
I used to think it was easy honey
I used to think it was alright
I used to think it was simple enough
Till scratching my way became my way of life
