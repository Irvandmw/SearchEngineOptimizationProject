Lyrics:


Wanted, someone who kissed me
And held me closely, then stole my heart
Wanted, someone I trusted
Who gave no warning we'd ever part

She was last seen hiding out in someone's arms
He knew nothing of the danger in her charms
A jury may find her guilty
But I'd forgive her if I could see
A signed confession that she's repented
And really wanted no one but me

[Musical Interlude]

Wanted, someone who kissed me
And held me closely, then stole my heart
Wanted, someone I trusted
Who gave no warning that we'd ever part

She was last seen hiding out in someone's arms
He knew nothing of the danger in her charms
A jury may find her guilty
But I'd forgive her if I could see
A signed confession that she's repented
And really wanted no one but me
