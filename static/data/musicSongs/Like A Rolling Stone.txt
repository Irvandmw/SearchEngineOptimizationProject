Lyrics:


Once upon a time, you dressed so fine
Through the bums of dime in your prime
Didn't you
People call say beware doll, you're bound to fall
You thought they were all
Kidding you

You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seems so proud
About having to be scrounging
For your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

Oh, you went to the finest school alright, Mr. Lonely
But you know you're only used to get juiced in
Nobody ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise
With a mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As he used to the vacuum of his eyes
And you ask him would you like to
Make a deal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
