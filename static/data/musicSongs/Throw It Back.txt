Lyrics:


Let me see you go
Let me see you go
Let me see you

20 thousand ain't nothing
Baby, you can get whatever you want from me
How you twerkin' on a Sunday?
Got a nigga wishin' I can be between your knees
All I think about is fuckin' (For real)
All these niggas think that you gon' be they fantasy (No)
And I ain't lyin', girl, I love it
Wherever you are is where I wanna be

Oh, girl
If you let me fuck tonight, baby
Oh, girl, no-no-no-no
We can do it

Baby, throw it back (Back), back on your boy (Oh)
Make it, make it drop, and don't stop
Baby, throw it back (Back), back on your boy (Oh)
Make it, make it drop, and don't stop
Baby, baby, baby, baby
'Cause that ass real fat (Fat) and I love that (That)
Baby, shake it for me, you can make that ass clap
If I'm coming back, b-b-back, give me some more
Make it, make it drop, and don't stop
Oh, yeah

Uh, fuck up the bed, I go straight to third base
That pussy wet, she my little mermaid
Not just my tongue, I'ma use my whole face
Oh no (Yeah)
Huh, light up the blunt, sip a little Henny
Baby girl, you know that I'm ready (Ready)
Makin' sure that you don't forget me
No, oh

Oh, girl
If you let me fuck tonight, baby
Then I'ma hit the right spot
Girl, you can call me when you need some more

Baby, throw it back (Back), back on your boy (Yeah, oh)
Make it, make it drop, and don't stop (Throw it back)
Baby, throw it back (Back), back on your boy
Make it, make it drop, and don't stop (Baby, I love what you do when you throw it back)
Baby, baby, baby, baby
'Cause that ass real fat (Fat) and I love that (That)
Baby, shake it for me, you can make that ass clap (Ooh)
If I'm coming back, b-b-back, give me some more (Oh)
Make it, make it drop, and don't stop
Oh, yeah (Huh)

Rollin' on me, kissin' on me down low
And I'm freakin' you up
A little foreplay before we get down to business
Ha, take off your clothes
Make you feel good when you naked
Girl, your skin feels so smooth (Oh)
Put them titties on me
I won't be afraid
'Less we grown enough (Grown enough)
We both in love (Both in love)
You know that pussy's for dada
Let me see you go
You know that you mean a lot so
Let's get freaky 'cause I feel lucky

Baby, throw it back (Back), back on your boy (Throw that thing on me, yeah, yeah)
Make it, make it drop, and don't stop
Baby, throw it back (Back), back on your boy (Do it all night, oh)
Make it, make it drop, and don't stop
Baby, baby, baby, baby
'Cause that ass real fat (Oh) and I love that (Hey)
Baby, shake it for me, you can make that ass clap (Ooh, me)
If I'm coming back, b-b-back, give me some more (Ooh)
Make it, make it drop, and don't stop
Oh, yeah
