Lyrics:


Terry
Are you optimistic
'bout the way things are going?
Peter
No, I nver ever think of it at all
Terry
Don't you ever worry
When you see what's going down?
Peter
No, I try to mind my business,
that is, no business at all
Terry
When it's time to function
as a feeling human being, will your
Bachelor of Arts help you get by?
Peter
I hope to study further,
a few more years or so. I also hope
to keep a steady high
Terry
Will you try to change
things, use the power that you have,
the power of a million new ideas?
Peter
What is this power you
speak of and this need for things to
change? I always thought
that everything was fine
Terry
Don't you feel repression just
closing in around?
Peter
No, the campus here is very, very free
Terry
Does it make you angry
the way war is dragging on?
Peter
Well, I hope the President
knows what he's into, I don't know
Terry
Don't you ever see the starvation
in the city where you live, all the
needless hunger all the
needless pain?
Peter
I haven't been there lately,
the country is so fine, but my
neighbors don't seem hungry 'cause
they haven't got the time
Terry
Thank you for the talk,
you know you really eased my mind
I was troubled by the shapes
of things to come.
Peter
Well, if you had my
outlook your feelings would be
numb, you'd always think
that everything was fine
