Lyrics:


I hear sleigh bells ring
I havenât heard a word from you in years
I hear sleigh bells ringinâ
But I havenât heard a word from you in years
I hear choirs singinâ
And Iâm just sittinâ here cryinâ Christmas tears

Everybodyâs singinâ âMerry Christmasâ
As they watch the starry sky filled with reindeer
Everybodyâs singinâ âMerry Christmasâ
As they watch the starry sky filled with reindeer
Iâm smilinâ on the outside
But on the inside Iâm cryinâ Christmas tears

You been gone such a long, long time
But itâs Christmas and I canât get you off of my mind
Seems like you been gone a hundred years or more
But if you were here with me now
Iâd hang âMerry Christmasâ on my door

I need ya darling
Kiss and hold me tight
I need ya darling
On a lonely Christmas night
And as I sit and think of the lonely years
I canât help but cry, oh, Christmas tears
Oh, Christmas tears
