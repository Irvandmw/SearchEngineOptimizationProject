Lyrics:


Nahhhhhhaaaaaaaaaahhhhh
Baby you're so beautiful
And when I'm near you
I can't breathe, (I can't breathe)
A girl like you gets what she wants
When she wants it
You're so out of my league
(Out my league)
I show you no emotion
Don't let you see
What you're doin' to me
(That's what you seeing baby)
I imagine the two of us together
But I've been living in reality

Fear of rejection
Kept my love inside
But time is running out
So damn my foolish pride

I don't care if you think I'm crazy
(Crazy)
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad
(I don't care)
I've got no fear of losing you
You can't lose what you never had

Now I'm gonna confess
That I love you, (love you)
I've been keeping it inside
(Inside)
Feelin I could die
But if you turn away
Baby that's O.K.
At least we had a moment
Before you say goodbye
You can lose what you never had

Rules are made for breaking
(Breaking)
Nothing ventured nothing gained
I'll be no worse off
Then I am right now
And I might never get that chance again
Baby

Fear of rejection
Kept my love inside
Told my heart I didn't want you
But I lied

I don't care if you think I'm crazy
(I'm crazy)
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad
(Doesn't matter if it turns out bad)
I've got no fear of losing you
You can't lose what you never had
(Yeah)

Now I'm gonna confess that I love you
(I love you)
I've been keeping it inside, (inside)
Feelin I could die, (I could die)
But if you turn away
Baby that's O.K.
At least we'll have a moment before
You say good-bye, (before you say goodbye)

Here on the outside looking in
Don't wanna stay dreaming bout
What could have been
Need to hear you speak my name
Even if you shoot me down in flames

I don't care if you think I'm crazy
(I 'm crazy baby)
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad
(If it turns out bad)
I've got no fear of losing you
You can't lose what you never had

Now I'm gonna confess that I love you
(That I love you girl)
I've been keepin it inside
Feelin I could die, (die)
But if you turn away
Baby that's O.K
At least we have a moment before
You say good-bye

You can't lose what you never had
You can't lose what you never had
You can't lose what you never had
