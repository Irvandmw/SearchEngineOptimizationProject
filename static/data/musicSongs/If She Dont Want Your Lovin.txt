Lyrics:


If she don't, if she don't, if she don't, if she don't
Want your lovin'
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it right to me
If she don't, if she don't, if she don't, if she don't
Want your lovin'
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it right to me

Yes, it's true that a fool and his wealth will soon come to part
And the cost is much the same when it's a broken heart
She don't seem to realize that of her is all you think
She's so busy playing the field that she forgot about the love you gave

And darling, all I'm trying to say is that when you run out of patience with her
I'll be waiting just outside your world
To be the lover in which you can believe

If she don't want your lovin', give it to me
And I'll take it
Let me take you off her hands
And show you what you can do with a real woman
Oh, if she don't want it, your lovin'
Give it to me, 'cause I'll take it
Gladly take you off her hands
And show you what you can do with a real woman, baby

Comes a time when everyone must draw the line
And that time is overdue for you
You gave it all that you had to give
But it's clear she loves someone else and not you
No sense in continuing to rub salt in your wound
If she can't see your love for her
Oh, she don't deserve it anyhow

And baby, all I'm trying to say
Is I wish you'd give my love a try
Ooh, and when you do, you're gonna find
Just like you, it's worth the time

If she don't want your lovin', give it to me, boy
I said I'll take it
Let me take you off her hands
And show you what you can do with a real woman, yeah
(Come here, boy, and let me show you what you can do with a real woman)
Oh oh, yeah, give it to me, I'll take it
Gladly take you off her hands
And show you what you can do with a real woman, baby

Sweet thang, I mean, really now, really
Why don't you back up off that girl and give her some room
'Cause I'm the work, baby, and you are too
Don't you know that, huh?
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
And she don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
I mean, let me show you, baby
Gladly take you off her hands
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
Hey, let me, let me, let me
Gladly take you off her hands
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
Gladly take you off her hands
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
Gladly take you off her hands
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
Gladly take you off her hands
And if she don't like that, tell her come see Sugar Ray Aretha
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby
