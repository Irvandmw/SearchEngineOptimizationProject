Lyrics:


[Chorus]
That old wheel is gonna roll around once more
When it does it will even up the score
Donât be weak: as they sew, they will reap
Turn the other cheek and donât give in
That old wheel will roll around again

When love is gone and the one you thought would stay
Does you wrong, and youâre left alone to pay
The price is high
But somehow youâll survive, donât give in
That old wheel will roll around again

[Chorus]

Thereâll be times, hard to control
And youâll find youâll hurt down in your soul
Thereâll be those whoâll be glad to see you down
But donât give in, that old wheel will roll around again

[Chorus x2]

Roll around, around, again, again
