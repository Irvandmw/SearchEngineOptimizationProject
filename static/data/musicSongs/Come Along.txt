Lyrics:


I've met a lotta friends, 
Been a lotta places, 
Hung out in Hollywood, 
With all the perfect faces, 
Girls with dark tans, 
Surfboards, the right bands, 
Sometimes I feel like I could, 
Hold the whole world in my hands... 

Till I met You, 
There were these things that made my day, 
But You changed my views, 
And I realized that there is more to life, 
Than a Chevrolet. 

And You say there's something different now, 
About the way I hold my head, and I am, 
Ready for it now, 
To line 'em up and knock them down.. 

[Chorus]
Come along now 
Grab a hand I'll show you how 
We can all get out of here, 
Well soon we'll all be gettin' clear. 
Take me, break me, you never gonna shake me, 
There's a lot about me you don't know so don't doubt me... 
I was sent to let the world know, 
Wind me up and let me go, 
Told ya I would never be truly artificial, 
Won't just back down sittin' in the background 
Never play your enemy you'll never see the end of me 

It's ok, if you need some time, 
Need some time to think, 
And it's alright, 
I won't walk the line, 
Until I see you blink [x2]

[Chorus]
