Lyrics:


I'm not going to talk about doubts and confusion
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
I'd never been to Ayrshire
I hitched down one saturday
Sixty miles to Kilmarnock
To see Hibernian play
The day was bright and sunny
But the game I won't relay
And there was no Kilmarnock bunnet
To make me want to stay

But I'm not going to talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
No I'm not going to talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut

When I started walking at Wishaw
My eyes obscured my vision
After five miles on my way
I began to learn to listen

But I'm not going to talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
No I'm not going to talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut

I walked through the country
I walked through the town
I held my head up
And I didn't look down

And I'm not going to talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
No I'm not going to talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut

The question doesn't matter
The answer's always "aye"
The best view of all
Is where the land meets the sky.

But I'm not going to talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
No I'm not going to talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
