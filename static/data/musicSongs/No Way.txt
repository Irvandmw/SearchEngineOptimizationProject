Lyrics:


When I hop up in the wraith
It's a high speed chase
Push the pedal to the floor
I won't quit, no way
You can't stall us
No matter what they say
I won't quit, no way
Fuckin' no way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm the same old kid with the high school dreams
Got my eye on the prize, get it by any means
Just go, push the pedal to the floor
Game up in my hands, and bitch, I'll never let it go
Die for this shit, I would
No matter what they say, always knew that I could
There are things that I won't let them take from me
There are dreams that I won't let them take from me
Oh yeah

All my life I knew I could
I fantasized 'bout living good
Fuck the tens, I want the hunnids, yeah
Blue bands, just keep 'em comin', yeah
Tell the family we finally safe, but

When I hop up in the wraith
It's a high speed chase (It's a high speed chase)
Push the pedal to the floor
I won't quit, no way (I won't quit, no way)
You can't stall us (You can't stall us)
No matter what they say (No matter what they say)
I won't quit, no way (I won't quit, no way)
Fuckin' no way (No way)
