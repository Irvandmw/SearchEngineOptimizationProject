Lyrics:


Why am I alone? 
Why am I alone, 
Traveling down a lonely road? 

Darling, can't you see? 
I don't wanna be, 
Traveling down a lonely road. 

If you would open up your heart 
And let my love come shining through, 
You'd know how much 
I wanna walk the road with you... 

Won't you understand? 
Won't you take my hand? 
It's been such a lonely road... 

[Chorus Italian lyrics]

If you would open up your heart 
And let my love come shining through, 
You'd know how much 
I wanna walk the road with you... 

Won't you understand? 
Won't you take my hand? 
It's been such a lonely road... 

Such a lonely road...
