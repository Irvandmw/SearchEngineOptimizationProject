Lyrics:


Ahhhh
Donât need to get on a big ole plane, yeah
Youâre gonna hear us from Bangkok to Bangor, Maine
Live on your internet radio and satellite
Wherever you are, itâs Saturday night

Welcome to the party
The party heard around the world
Ainât no stopping, weâll be rocking 
Til theyâre dancing down in Timbuktu, girl
Welcome to the party heard around the world

Crank up the bass til it rattles your brain
Ainât loud enough if your neighbors donât complain
Bang out the beat on the dash of your car
Jump on the hood and play some air guitar, yeah

Welcome to the party, 
The party heard around the world
Ainât no stopping, weâll be rocking 
Til theyâre dancing down in Timbuktu, girl
Welcome to the party heard around the world, yeah

Get on your feet and raise your hands
Come on everybody sing along with the band, yeah

Welcome to the party
The party heard around the world
Ainât no stopping, weâll be rocking 
Til theyâre dancing down in Timbuktu, girl

Welcome to the party
The party heard around the world
Ainât no stopping, weâll be rocking 
Til theyâre dancing down in Timbuktu, girl

Welcome to, welcome to the party heard around the world
Ohhh welcome to the party, ohhhh yeah
