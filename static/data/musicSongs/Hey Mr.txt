Lyrics:


Hey Mr.
I'll wait around for you
Just like you ask me to
Hey Mr.
I'll do just what you say 
Cause you just make my day 

Tell me why
You cannot fall asleep at night
Tell me why
You cannot make you mine
To say I'm your only
Give me the chance
Say I'm your only
Love and romance

Hey Mr.
Well when you walk to me
Can't seem to move my feet
Hey Mr.
You know just what to say
You take my breath away

Well tell me why
You cannot fall asleep at night
And tell me why
You cannot make you mine
To say I'm your only
Yeah give me the chance (yeah yeah)
Say I'm your only
Love and romance

Hey Mr....

The way you say my name
It makes me feel this way
The way you hold me tight
It gets me through the night
And if you walk away
My heartbeat will remain to go down down down down

Hey Mr.
I'll wait around for you
Just like you ask me to
Woah yeah yeah
Hey Mr....
