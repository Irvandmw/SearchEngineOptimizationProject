Lyrics:


I've tried so hard, my dear, to show
That you're my every dream
And yet you're afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scheme

A memory from your lonesome past
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold heart?

Another love before my time
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart, my heart is paying now
For all of the things I didn't do

In anger unkind words are said
And these are, these are the things that make the teardrops start
Why, oh why can't I free your doubtful mind?
Ooh honey, I'd really like to melt your cold, cold heart

Why, oh why can't I free your doubtful mind?
And I really, really like to melt your [?]
