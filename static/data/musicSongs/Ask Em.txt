Lyrics:


Uh, Uh,
Yeah I got it now what is it,
Pay the world a visit,
Let them know I'm 'bout it with this golden ticket,
See my curriculum is flippin' 'em,
A hundred and fifty one yeah we sippin' 'em,
Bitches they trippin' all up in the club,
Show me love if you really 'bout it,
I don't never doubt it,
One of the best out of Maryland I'm down to shout it,
Never cocky I'm just confident the flow is prominent,
This is the reason that I'm dominant,
That automatic platinum plated flow know I'mma shine with it,
All of y'all is down to conform but I realign with it,
Performing at a full house,
Feeling like Uncle Jesse,
Bitches they stress me,
Take them to the crib undress three,
Children lie, men lie, women lie then we die,
But I'm here to tell the truth and let you know I'm finna rise,
To no surprise,
Fake rappers meet your demise,
The microphone and Adobe Audition my only supplies,
Look within my eyes,
Yes I'll bury the odds,
Now I ask em,
Is you feelin' me?

I got it back and now I'm on again,
Hit you in your chest like breathing after a shot of Gin,
I'm just a living organism that has arisen,
With so many bars I can manufacture for various prisons,
So let me show you what I'm bout and baby how I do it,
Flowing for hours every day just so I can improve it,
When I perform I envision a crowd and how to move it,
See I am lyrically inclined,
Alphabetically take apart and rebuild your mind,
I'm on my grind,
And guarantee ain't no style like mine,
I bring the force of course with no remorse,
I'm married to the game don't even talk about divorce,
'Till death do us part,
Reincarnate then restart,
With Biggie's eyes, Big L's mind, and Pac's heart,
Rip it apart, intravenously like poison dart,
Y'all bananas if you think I'm slipping in Mario's karts.
