[Lil Dicky:]
Cool Brain
Y'know, I think you might be better off
Focusing just a bit more
[Brain:]
What, whatchu mean I'm f-
I'm locked in bro I'm
Whatchu mean?
[Lil Dicky:]
No it sounds cool and all I'm just saying
Like you know
Maybe it could be a little less random
Or if you-
[Brain:]
Man, don't get all high and mighty at me bro
My shit a wave bro
Fuck outta here
[Lil Dicky:]
No totally and I like your music
I think it's-- I like it
I just think I'd love it
[Brain:]
Man
[Lil Dicky:]
Let's just come up with some ideas for you
[Brain:]
Like song topics and shit that's what you sayin?
[Lil Dicky:]
Yeah exactly let's brainstorm some topics
[Brain:]
Ohhh no you said brainstorm?

[Lil Dicky:]
Uhh yeah just a brainstorm
[Brain:]
Brain gotta think
Brain don't even know
[Lil Dicky:]
What's going on?
[Brain:]
Usain Brain, they call me Usain Brain cuz I'm fast
[Lil Dicky:]
Brain in the club
Brain thinking up stuff
Brain pourin up
What's going on man?
[Brain:]
Tell 'em Brain! Heyyy!

It's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Time to think of some ideas
It's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Everybody know the drill
Oh it's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Time to get my ass in gear

Brain don't even know
But the Brain don't even know
But the Brain don't even know
[Lil Dicky:]
What the fuck is happening?
[Brain:]
Brain so overanalyzed
Scrutinizing every single move
[Lil Dicky:]
So weird
[Brain:]
The Brain had no further questions Your Honor (I object)
Well I can testify

There was a brainstorm
There's a brainstorm
Time to think of some ideas
We in this it's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Everybody know the drill
Oh it was a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Everybody know the drill
Woah Nelly it's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Better bring your best ideas

[Lil Dicky:]
What the fuck was that?
Did you even come up with anything or no?
[Brain:]
No, not yet, but the process is underway now
So any minute
I should be cookin' I should be whippin' it up
[Lil Dicky:]
Alright, take your time
It's your process just let me know
I'm always down to help whip or whatever you need, so
I'll be, I'll be in the kitchen
[Brain:]
Whatchu want, whatchu gonna make?
[Lil Dicky:]
Nah, I'm actually just gonna clean the kitchen
[Brain:]
Oh alright, bet
[Lil Dicky:]
You say bet now?
[Brain:]
Yeah
Alright, see you later Brain
