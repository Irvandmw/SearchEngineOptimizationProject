Lyrics:


You don't have to buy me things
I don't need another ring
Love is all you bring
Just make it simple

It's you adore
Leave the presents at the door
She said just make it simple for me

The best things are free
A kiss is all I need
A precious memory, make it simple

Now we don't have much time
No regrets and no goodbyes
She said just make it simple for me

You can't always catch every leaf as it's falling
And I can't catch my breath, so say it clear
To embrace every second, every minute and every hour
Try and love every moment we are here

Life passes by in the blink of an eye
We just gotta try and make it simple
(She said)
Promise you won't cry
Keep this thought of me alive
She said just make it simple for me

You can't always catch every leaf as it's falling
You gotta stop, live your life, no more tears

Life passes by in the blink of an eye
We just gotta try and make it simple
(She said)
Promise you won't cry
Keep this thought of me alive
She said just make it simple for me
She said just make it simple for me
Just make it simple for me
For me
