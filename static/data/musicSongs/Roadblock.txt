Lyrics:


Hazard on the highway keeping me from you
Gonna rev my engine up, I'm gonna truck on through

Cause she's a roadblock baby, and she's blocking you and me
Yeah she's a roadblock, baby, she's a barricade
Once I pass her, you know we'll have it made
Have it made

Roadblock, roadblock baby
Roadblock, roadblock baby

Treats you like a prisoner, all tied up in knots
You don't really need her calling all the shots

She's a roadblock baby, and she's blocking you and me
Let me tell ya she's a roadblock, baby, bumpy ride
I'm gonna get you, you'll be satisfied
You'll be satisfied, yeah

Roadblock, roadblock baby
Roadblock, roadblock baby

Let me tell ya she's a roadblock baby, great big barricade
But once I pass her, you know we're gonna have it made
We'll have it made

Roadblock, roadblock baby
Roadblock, roadblock baby

Roadblock
