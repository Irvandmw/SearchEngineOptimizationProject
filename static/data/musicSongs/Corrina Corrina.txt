Lyrics:


Corrina, Corrina
Gal, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina
Gal where you been so long?
I been worr'in' about you, baby
Baby, please come home

I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
But I ain't a-got Corrina
Life don't mean a thing

Corrina, Corrina
Gal, you're on my mind
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, you're on my mind
I was sittin' down thinking of you
I just can't keep from crying
