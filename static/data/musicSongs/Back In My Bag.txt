Lyrics:


Real life mermaid man, hahahaha
(Mermaid)
Look she-she know it
What you say, mermaid?
(For you)
Nah, for us

[Future:]
I'm back in my big ass big ass bag, I'm back in my big old bag
I'm going cr-crazy crazy crazy, niggas ain't notice my swag
I got splash splash splash, niggas ain't on that, yeah yeah
I come on your set and let forty deuce
Ain't no screen shot all my hoes
Open up the trap door, never close
Real bando, it don't ever close
We serving narcotics
You were deserted, jump on the jet, yeah
Catching them bodies
And you're going to buy a bitch chanel bags
Came from out the bottom, can't nothing change that
Get your chain snatched

[Doe Boy:]
I got my big ass, big ass bag, back in my big ass bag, yeah
Come to the club and I blow through the racks
I got they bitch ass mad, yeah hold on
Ice on my wrist, yeah that bitch an AP
That bitch a liar, she say she date me
She wanna fuck on a nigga that's street
But you ain't for me, bitch you for weak
I just pulled up in a Rover
Poured that dirty in my soda
Ain't no cuffing bitch I told you
Better not love me, I fuck you over
We shoot first, don't shoot back
I just bought a new Mac
Walking in McCartney's feel like Stella got her groove back
Step in the club and I'm making a movie
These pussy niggas ain't doing shit too
Glock on my hip but my bro got the uzi
Me and her nigga, you know she gonna choose me
Shoot up your block then we spin it again
I go to Lennox, I'm spending a 10
Lost in the sauce so I fuck on her friend
No loyalty in her, she went for the win

[Future:]
I'm back in my big ass big ass bag, I'm back in my big old bag
I'm going cr-crazy crazy crazy, niggas ain't notice my swag
I got splash splash splash, niggas ain't on that, yeah yeah
I come on your set and let forty deuce
Ain't no screen shot all my hoes
Open up the trap door, never close
Real bando, it don't ever close
We serving narcotics
You were deserted, jump on the jet, yeah
Catching them bodies
And you're going to buy a bitch chanel bags
Came from out the bottom, can't nothing change that
Get your chain snatched
