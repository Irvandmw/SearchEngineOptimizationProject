Lyrics:


There's a long black train coming down the line
Feeding off of souls that are lost and crying
Rails of sin only evil remains
Watch out brother for that long black train

Look to the Heavens, you can look to the skies
You can find redemption staring back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same
Burning your ticket for that long black train, cause

There's victory in the Lord I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and His Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train

There's an engineer on that long black train
Making you wonder if the ride is worth the pain
He's just a waiting on your heart to say
Let me ride on that long black train, but you know

There's victory in the Lord I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and His Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train

I can hear the whistle from a mile away
It sounds so good but I must stay away
That train is a beauty, making everybody stare
But it's only destination is the middle of nowhere, and you know

There's victory in the Lord I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and His Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train

I said cling to the Father and His Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train
Yeah watch out brother for that long black train
That devil's a drivin' that long black train
