Lyrics:


I can still hear my boombox boomin shakin my bedroom walls
Turn it down boy that hair metal noise donât sound like music at all
I can still see that next door neighbor girl face down in the sun
On her trampoline with that little string of her bikini top undone

[Chorus:]
I miss when time moved slower and too loud sounded good
And work meant pushinâ a mower all over my neighborhood
I miss when aâs and bâs were all I had to worry about
And love was seven minutes in heaven and spinninâ a bottle around

I can still smell mamaâs fried chicken in the kitchen right after church
Every sundayâd be a pickup game
In the yard til somebody got hurt
I can still feel my knees buckle
With the taste of that first kiss
Bubblegum mixed with cherry chapstick and I couldnât wait to do it again

[Chorus:]
I miss when time moved slower and too loud sounded good
And work meant pushinâ a mower all over my neighborhood
I miss when aâs and bâs were all I had to worry about
And love was seven minutes in heaven and spinninâ a bottle around

I miss when time moved slower and too loud sounded good
And work meant pushinâ a mower all over my neighborhood
I miss when aâs and bâs were all I had to worry about
And love was seven minutes in heaven and spinninâ a bottle around
Yeah love was seven minutes in heaven
And spinninâ a bottle around
Yeah I miss when
