Lyrics:


There've been a few loves in my live
But none who have loved me as you
You're within my heart so deep
You're with me whether I'm awake or I'm sleep
And with your hand in mine there is no height I dare not climb, no

As long, as long as you hold my hand
There is no, no fate that I can't withstand
And although tears may fall
I know you'll drive them all
As long, as long as you are there (are there)

Darling, darling in you I find
Happiness on peace of mind
A lover like I've never known
And I'm so glad, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're my very own

As long, as long, as long, as long, as long as you hold my hand
Darling there is no, there is no fate that I, I can't withstand
And although I stumble and fall (baby, baby)
Baby, I know, I know that you'll hear my call
As long, just as long as you are there
