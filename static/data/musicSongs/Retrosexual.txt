Lyrics:


What do you say we get outta here, kid?

One lost lady and the radio creep
Got your hands in my pockets while you're spinnin' the beat
The vinyl spins fast while we trippin' on that
She said "I can't stand still"
One trick bunny and a hunting man
Got lost in the woods with a gun in the hand
She said "Hey love child, take me back"
I said "I can't stand still"

Shake your head 'cause she wants to
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming off the girl's names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)

Heard a story 'bout the medicine man
Drove straight to the coast in his minivan
He'll learn the ways of the local dudes
He said "I can't stand still"
Missy Brown went to pristine high
Met the medicine man for a token around
She said "It's been so long since we got down"
He said "I can't stand still"

Shake your head 'cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girl's names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)

The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round

Shake your head 'cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girl's names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)
