Lyrics:


No-No-No I'm not bitter, I'm not mad
Well, maybe just a little, just a tad.
I know every apple here ain't bad,
But I found a worm in every single one I had.
(Boys) They're only good for fruit, I mean bananas.
(Boys) Them boys so nuts, they're drivin' me bananas
Oh boys, we should pack them up and ship em out.
Bo-bo-bo-boys Bo-boys
Bo-bo-bo-boys Bo-boys
I hate em.

I hate boys, but boys love me.
I think they suck and my friends agree.
I hate boys, but boys love me.
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah,
I. Hate. Boys.

If you hate em boys, shake it.
If you hate em boys, shake it.

We would all be happy all be glad,
If sweet mama nature never had,
A-all this dirty little boys who think that the girls
are only made for toys
Boys wants them women, though they barely can remember.
Then again all men are dogs.
All men are dogs.

I hate boys, but boys love me.
I think they suck and my friends agree.
I hate boys, but boys love me.
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah,
I. Hate. Boys.

If you hate em boys, shake it.
If you hate em boys, shake it.

Let's go
BOYS SUCK.
MAKE ME SICK.
INFLATED EGOS.
LITTLE DICKS.
USE THEM UP.
SPIT EM OUT.
I H-A-T-E Boooooys!

I hate boys, but boys love me.
I think they suck and my friends agree.
I hate boys, but boys love me.
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah,
I. Hate. Boys.

I hate boys, but boys love me.
I think they suck and my friends agree.
I hate boys, but boys love me.
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah,
I. Hate. Boys.
