Lyrics:


Man, I don't know why I keep doin' this shit to myself
Shit crazy
Stressful as a motherfucker
I wear my heart on my sleeve, nigga
Glass house
Fuck you talkin' 'bout?

On to the next
Already forgot ya like I never knew ya
Watch me pull up in that Phantom while I'm livin' in Miami (Hey!)
Got my heart rollin' dice in a centerfold
Should've listened when I told ya
Should have never played the games
'Cause I been away too long (Too long)
And my fall back game too strong (Yeah!)
Now you blowin' up my phone
Talkin' all the shit I would have, but the moment's gone

And now I'm down and my heart is made of stone, oh
Ooh, yeah

Oh, look what you done
You gon' make me pull up on you with the next bitch right now (Right now)
Ain't no tellin' what I might do from now (Oh-whoa)
Oh, and now we're over and done (Done)
If you didn't know that I'm that nigga, bet you know now
If you didn't know, bet you know now

Tired, playin' same shit for ya
Done flexin' on you
Oh-whoa, oh-oh
Tired, playin' same shit for ya
Done flexin' on you
Haha, yeah!

To my niggas said they had they way with you, way with you
You know that I don't want it if another nigga on it now
I ain't got no time to play no game with you (No)
Flooded out the Rollie just to drip it on you, drip it on you
Want me to be stressin', but, girl, you know I'm not
Now you all in my Tumblr tryna see what I'm on
I thought I told you that my fall back game too strong
Talkin' all the shit I would have, but the moment's gone

And now I'm down and my heart is made of stone, oh

Oh, look what you done (You done)
You gon' make me pull up on you with the next bitch right now (Yeah)
Ain't no tellin' what I might do from now (Oh-whoa)
Oh, and now we're over and done (Done)
If you didn't know that I'm that nigga, bet you know now
If you didn't know, bet you know now

Tired, playin' same shit for ya (Oh)
Done flexin' on you
Oh-whoa (Oh, baby)
Tired, playin' same shit for ya (Ooh-ooh)
Done flexin' on you (Hee-hee-hee)
Hol' up!

Bitch reckless tryna hang out with the enemies (Yeah)
Goin' to another nigga, show up and he pull you out the club
Go 'head with the ho-ass Tennessee's (Oh)
You wanna fuck that nigga, go 'head and fuck him 'cause I won't hold you down
He gon' let you go in a minute
And all these niggas wanna fuck my bitches because I'm winnin'
Nigga, let me know when you finished
'Cause you ain't gettin' over, no, no
That's what I call pimpin'

Oh, look what you done
You gon' make me pull up on you with the next bitch right now (Oh, hey)
Ain't no tellin' what I might do from now (Yeah)
Oh, and now we're over and done (Oh)
If you didn't know that I'm that nigga, bet you know now (Bet you know now)
If you didn't know, bet you know now (Bet)

Tired, playin' same shit for ya (Oh)
Done flexin' on you (Oh, oh!)
Tired, playin' same shit for ya
Done flexin' on you, oh

If you didn't know I'm that nigga, bet you know now
If you didn't know I'm that nigga, bet you know now
If you didn't know, bet you know now
