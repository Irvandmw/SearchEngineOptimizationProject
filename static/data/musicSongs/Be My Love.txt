Lyrics:


Be my love
For no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you fill my dreams
The dreams that you inspire
With every sweet desire

Be my love
And with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need
To seal my fate
And hand in hand
We'll find loves promised land
There'll be no one but you for me, eternally
If you will be, be my love

And hand in hand
We'll find loves promised land
There'll be no one but you for me, eternally
If you will be, be my love
