Lyrics:


"Oh, man."
"Got so much to do. Huh, honey?"
"Yes, definitely. I'm just..."
"Well, look, again, if you need mom to come out there for a week..."
"I don't think that [?] needing, like, mothering."
"No, no, not mothering. Organizing. Or doing, doing tasks."
"Yes, right."
"That's not, that's not..."
"Getting your plane tickets..."
"That's like, that's not..."
"Making sure that your clothes are, are, things that, no, just organization. Not mothering."
"I don't, I don't have to worry about that. Like, people handle that stuff."
"Ok."
"Ok."
"So how are you gonna get strippers in Boston and New York and Philadelphia..."
"The question is whether the clubs will allow it."
"Uh, I probably only would get strippers for Philadelphia."
"Well, you're breaking up again."
"I said, I probably would only get strippers for Philadelphia."
"But, but, a practical question in organization is, do they allow it?"
"Yeah..."
"Someone could research that for you. That's another detail."
"Yeah, why don't you take care of that detail for me? Figure out what venues allow strippers. Is that something you guys could handle or no?"
"No. Cause I don't know what venues... You would have to ask William Mars or whoever's booking this stuff to find out for you. We can't find that out."
"Well, if like I give you, if I give you the venue name and number, you guys could call."
"You could do that."
"I, yeah, I'll call."
"I'm kidding, I'm not gonna have you guys call a concert venue and have you guys ask if you could, if your son could have strippers at his show, that's ridiculous. I don't need you guys to do that. Of course. I can't believe you guys thought that."
"Well, what do you want us to do?"
"Nothing! Nothing, I'm joking around. I can't believe you're even entertaining this as like a thing you would do."
