Lyrics:


I could pull the sheets over my head
And never get out of this bed
But what would that do?
I avoid all mirrors
'Cause I'm scared to look into my eyes
When I only see you

It's like you're always creeping
On the walls and in my feelings
All those stories about ghosts
Are really true

I put one foot
In front of the other
In front of the other
Slowly, I turn every corner
Turn every corner
Even when you're nowhere in the room
I'm haunted by you
I light all my candles
Light all my candles
The darkness is too hard to handle
Too hard to handle
Sleeping is just something I can't do
I'm haunted by you

I can hear you talking in the distance
Your persistence is so cruel
And all your words pull at my feet
And I fall back in love with you
What can I do?

It's like you're always creeping
On the walls and in my feelings
All those stories about ghosts
Are really true

I put one foot
In front of the other
In front of the other
Slowly, I turn every corner
Turn every corner
Even when you're nowhere in the room
I'm haunted by you
I light all my candles
Light all my candles
The darkness is too hard to handle
Too hard to handle
Sleeping is just something I can't do

We used to be so warm
But now we're just an ice storm
Slowly freezing up my heart
We used to be so warm
But now we're just an ice storm
Slowly freezing up my heart, heart, heart

I put one foot
In front of the other
In front of the other
Slowly, I turn every corner
Turn every corner
Even when you're nowhere in the room
I'm haunted by you
I light all my candles
Light all my candles
The darkness is too hard to handle
Too hard to handle
Sleeping is just something I can't do
I'm haunted by you
