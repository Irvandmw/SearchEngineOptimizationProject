Song Name: Yesterday's Love
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


When I get to thinking about the past
And all of the good things that were too good to last
I cry in my heart for each little part
Of yesterday's love

A few tender moments when heaven was mine
The vows that you whispered
With each kiss was divine
How empty they seem, they're lost in a dream
With yesterday's love

Somewhere I lost you along the way
Lost without knowing the price that I'd pay
I can't help but wonder how things would have been
If I could start over and try it again

But love has its problems and bridges to burn
You have to cross over and you never return
For dreams have their day and then fade away
With yesterday's love
Yesterday's love
