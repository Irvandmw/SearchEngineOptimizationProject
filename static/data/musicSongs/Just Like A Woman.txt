Lyrics:


Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows, baby's got new clothes
Lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman
Yes she does, and she makes love just like a woman
Yes she does, and she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess, baby can't be blessed
Till she finds out she's like all the rest
With her car, her amphetamines, and her pearls

You take just like a woman
Yes you do, and you make love just like a woman
Yes you do, and you ache... a woman
But you break just like a little girl

It was raining from the first
And I was dyin' there of thirst
So I came in here
Well, your long time curse hurts, but what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear

I just don't fit
I believe it's time for us to quit
And when we met again, introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry, it was your world

'Cause you take just like a woman
Yes you do, and you make love just like a woman
Yes you do, and you ache... a woman
But you break just like a little girl
