Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
'Til we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore

If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the side of the river of life

Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore

Oh they say we shall meet by the river
Where no storm clouds ever darken the sky
And they say we'll be happy in heaven
In that wonderful suite by and by

If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the side of the river of life

Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
