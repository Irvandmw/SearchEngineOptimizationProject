Lyrics:


Let's go chasing rainbows in the sky
It's my invitation
Let's all take a trip on my ecstasy

I'm Mr. Bad Guy
Yes, I'm everybody's Mr Bad Guy
Can't you see I'm Mr. Mercury
Oh, spread your wings and fly away with me

Your big daddy's got no place to stay
Bad communication
I feel like the President of the USA

Mr. Bad Guy, yes I'm everybody's Mr Bad Guy
Can't you see I'm Mr. Mercury
Oh, spread your wings and fly away with me

I'm Mr. Bad Guy, they're all afraid of me
I can ruin people's lives
Mr. Bad Guy, they're all afraid of me
It's the only way to be
That's my destiny
Mr. Bad Guy, Mr. Bad Guy, Mr. Bad Guy

It's the only way to be
It's my destiny, oh yeah

Mr. Bad Guy, yes I'm everybody's Mr Bad Guy
Can't you see this is my destiny
Oh, spread your wings and fly away with me
