Lyrics:


What the hellâs going on
Have you gone undercover?
You were here, now youâre not
Been replaced by another
Cause itâs still your face
But thereâs something strange
Not the one I remember
Can you please explain
Did they wipe your brain?
Is this gonna be forever?
Cause everything you say
Everything you do
Is freaking me out, freaking me out
You know we used to be the same
Who the hell are you
Freaking me out, freaking me out
Then I swear I thought I knew you
But all that was yesterday
And now you turn it around, whatâs that about?
Cause youâre freaking me out, freaking me out

Think youâre real, but youâre fake
Think youâre deep, but youâre shallow
Youâve become, what you hate
Now youâre lost, just a shadow
So we pull your strings
Cause it makes no sense
That you act like youâre better
You can say these things
To your so-called friends
And they just might think youâre clever

But everything you say
Everything you do
Is freaking me out, freaking me out
You know we used to be the same
Who the hell are you
Freaking me out, freaking me out
Then I swear I thought I knew you
But all that was yesterday
And now you turn it around, whatâs that about?
Cause youâre freaking me out, freaking me out

Wake up, wake up, wake up
Snap out of it
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Snap out of it
Wake up, wake up, wake up

Everything you say
Everything you do
Is freaking me out, freaking me out
You know we used to be the same
Who the hell are you
Freaking me out, freaking me out
And now
Everything you say
Everything you do
Is freaking me out, freaking me out
So whyâd you play your games
Whoâre you trying to fool?
Freaking me out, freaking me out
And I swear I thought I knew you
But all that was yesterday
And now you turn it around, whatâs that about?
Cause youâre freaking me out, freaking me out
