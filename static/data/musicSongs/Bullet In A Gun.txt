Lyrics:


The Roman king, the Romulus
The precipice, born to change
The final days, the last appraise
Augustus, Nero, takin' names

I'm high then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun (Hey)
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a gun

To make a name, you pay the price
You give your life, no other way
The devil's deal, it comes around
To wear the crown, rise up from the ground

I'm high then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun (Hey)
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a gun

How many voices go unheard?
How many lessons never learned?
How many artists fear the light,
Fear the pain, go insane?
Lose the mind, lose yourself
(You only care about fame and wealth)
Sellout, sellout, SELLOUT

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun (Hey)
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a-
