Lyrics:


Come, come, my dear 
Take flight, come near 
I see your fear creeping around you 
First love, then hate, then love, no, wait 
Your confusion, itâs gonna  kill me 
I broke for you, I woke for you
You taught me through, God love you,
I see the signs are out of line
No fault of mine 
Except for donât say his name now 

Iâm breaking out, something ainât right here 
Youâre falling out something ainât here 

The scream, I burn 
Whatâs that, you say
Your cloud itâs telling you lies now 
You hear my voice,
You make some noise 
You stole my choice
Itâs over now 
Pray for him now 
I speak to you

Iâm breaking out, something ainât right here
Youâre falling out, something ainât right here
Iâm breaking out, something ainât right here
Youâre falling out, falling out from, falling out, youâre falling out
Why canât you see it?

Oooooooooh

Iâll pray for you now 
Iâm speaking to you
