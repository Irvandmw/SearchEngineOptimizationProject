Lyrics:


Midnight at the glamour show on a Sunday Night
Everybody drink alotta whiskey and wine
We dance like no tomorrow
Weâre on Burlesque time
But everybodyâs gotta work tomorrow at nine

Touch me t-touch me baby but donât mess up my hair
Love me l-love me crazy
But donât get too attached, this is a brief affair

Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (there is a camera, so many beauty queens)
Vanity (itâs so good to be)
Fabulous and glamourous, we love ourselves and no one else
Va-va-va-va-vanity va-vanity, va-va-va-vanity

Nothinâ wrong with being just a little bit vain
We need a little pretty cuz this countryâs insane
So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothings quite as sexy as a woman is fine

Touch me touch me baby but donât mess up my hair
Love me love me crazy
But donât get too attached, this is a brief affair

Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (there is a camera, so many beauty queens)
Vanity (itâs so good to be)
Fabulous and glamourous, we love ourselves and no one else

Look at me (watcha lookin' at)
Look at me (watcha starin' at)
Look at me (watcha lookin' at)
Look at me (watcha starin'at)

Iâm cominâ around, Iâm sippin on Andre, itâs time
I heard the cutie's in the back, start in the p-party line
Letâs dance (quick round) weâre in the vanity house
Weâre covered in sequins, diamonds, we're happy cuz we're shinin

Touch me touch me baby but donât mess up my hair
Love me love me crazy
But donât get too attached, this is a brief affair

Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (there is a camera, so many beauty queens)
Vanity (itâs so good to be)
Fabulous and glamourous, we love ourselves and no one else

Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (there is a camera, so many beauty queens)
Vanity (itâs so good to be)
Fabulous and glamourous, we love ourselves and no one else
Va-va-va-va-vanity va-vanity, va-va-va-vanity
