Lyrics:


If you want to you can stick around,
'Cause its alright, tonight.
She said "I will stay here, stay with you
'Cause you're alright, tonight."
And I, I hoped that things would turn
Out my way 'cause she's alright, tonight.
She said "This is fun, this is good, yes,
It's alright, it's alright."

[Chorus]
Do you want this one night stand?
Let's take a risk and go play in the sand.
You can leave that ring on your finger.
I'm a sinner, you're the winner, I am too.

We made out now, we made up, yeah.
We made love for the world cup I said.
I want things I've never had before,
She said "Alright, tonight."
So we entered heaven to accept our fate,
And to sum it up baby, it was great, yeah.
It's not often that I see the light
but it's - it's alright, it's alright.

[Chorus]
Do you want this one night stand?
Let's take a risk go play in the sand.
You can leave that ring on your finger.
I'm a sinner, you're the winner, I am too.

Here she comes again now,
Here she comes again now,
Here we go again now.

Do you want this one night stand [3x]

(all right all right)

[Chorus]
Do you want this one night stand?
Let's take a risk go play in the sand.
You can leave that ring on your finger.
I'm a sinner, you're the winner, I am too. [3x]

It's alright. [15x]

You can leave that ring on your finger.
I'm a sinner, you're the winner, I am too.
