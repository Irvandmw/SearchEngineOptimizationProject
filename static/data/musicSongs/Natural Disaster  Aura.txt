Lyrics:


["Natural Disaster"]

Baby, let me bite it, itâs the softest,
Let me touch you, tongue kissin' on that pussy
Know you like it
Now we vibin'
If it's gettin' too hot in here, take it off then
I'm that sun in your garden (Garden)
Moon in your ocean, babe (Ocean, babe)
I'm the flame to your fire (Fire)
Quakers and tidal waves (Waves)

Natural disaster
When we love, the world breaks
When we love, the bed shakes
Thatâs why they say, (Huh)
Don't fall in love, it's a mistake (Oh)
But baby, don't be scared, cause they afraid
And know nothing's gon' change but my feelings about you
'Cause love stronger than it

Baby, my eyes wide open, so real now (Huh)
When we're in love, they make a big deal 'bout it (Huh)
You made a grave, I dug it out (Huh)
These words are never said
I came here to love you
Take me instead

We always causin' natural disasters
I'm not gonna make you decide
Gonna take a leap of faith
Not gonna make you pick a side
I know it, oh-oh, you love me
I'm standin' here 'cause you chose me
I'm not gonna let them take your life
We're together and they know we gon' shine too bright
Two stars, supernova, at the same time
We don't care, we don't care, we exchange life

Baby, my eyes wide open, so real now (Huh)
When we're in love, they make a big deal 'bout it (Huh)
You made a grave, I dug it out (Huh)
These words are never said
I came here to love you
Take me instead

We always causin' natural disasters

["Aura"]

I think that we should listen to
All the signs that this love provides
We know all this forgiven
Once you hear the truth from me and not the lies
I won't put my pain on you
Pain on me, this pain on you
Imagination
Vibrate with me 'cause I see what you're seein'
Know you see all of the colors
How 'bout you level me up?
In the bedroom
Come and get under the covers
So we can be one (Be one, huh)

And when you feel me all around you, say it
Rollin' all around 'til you can't take it
Ain't goin' nowhere, girl, just face it
You want the same thing, love
And now we got it

Ooh, and now we got this aura (Huh)
I gotta get this off (Huh)
You know you all mine
You're all mine
And now we got this aura (Huh)
I gotta get this off

(Huh) You know you all mine
(Huh) You know you all mine
