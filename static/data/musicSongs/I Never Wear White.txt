Lyrics:


I never wear white
White is for virgins
Children in summer
Brides in the park.

My color is black black black
Black is for secrets
Outlaws and dancers
For the poet of the dark.

Black is the truth
Of my situation.
And for those of my station
In life. All other colors
Lie.

I never wear white
White is too blinding
Always reminding
Of the innocent who fall

My color is black black black
For the crone, and the bastard
The schoolgirl in uniform
The servant in the hall.

Black is the truth
Of my situation,
And for those of my station
In life. All other colors
Lie.

My color is black black black
Like the gangster and widow
Itâs the shade and the shadow
Itâs the depth into your eye

My color is black black black black black
