Lyrics:


Hello walls
How'd things go for you today
Don't you miss her
Since she up and walked away

And I'll bet you dread to spend
Another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company

Hello window
Well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely
Since our darling disappeared
Well look here, is that a teardrop
In the corner of your pane
Don't you try to tell me that it's rain

She went away
And left us all alone
The way she planned
Guess we'll have to learn to get along
Without her if we can

Hello ceiling
I'm gonna stare at you a while
You know I can't sleep
So won't you bear with me awhile
We must all stick together
Or else I'll lose my mind
I got a feelin'
She'll be gone a long, long time
