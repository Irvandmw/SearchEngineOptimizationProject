Lyrics:


[DM] You and me we're gonna be pardners
[DM] You and me we're gonna be pals
[DM] You and me we'll do and dare alike
[DM] We'll share what there's to share alike
[DM] That goes for money, pleasure or gals
[DM] You and me will be the greatest pardners, buddies and pals

[JL] You and me we're gonna be pardners
[Both] You and me we're gonna be pals
[Both] You and me when other friendships fail
[Both] We'll still be on that long, long trail
[Both] That leads up to those pearly corals
[Both] Up in the sky
[Both] You and me we'll be the greatest pardners, buddies and pals
[Both] You and me will be the greatest pardners, buddies and pals

[Both] You and me when other friendships fail
[Both] We'll still be on that long, long trail
[Both] That leads up to those pearly corals
[Both] Up in the sky
[Both] You and me we'll be the greatest pardners, buddies and pals
[Both] You and me will be the greatest pardners, buddies and pals
