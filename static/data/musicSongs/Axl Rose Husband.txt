Lyrics:


You my Axl Rose husband
Blue hydrangea
White Pontiac heaven
Me your red, white and blue girl
Star spangled danger
You my heaven,
Heaven King, king

I said, âDaddy, I need youâ (yes)
Greenwich, I need you
Strangled up in ivy
Iâm the garden of Eden
Lady Liberty
Til it flame I'm shinin'
Queen, queen

Youâre my one king daddy
Iâm your little queen
Red, white, and blue

Youâre my one king daddy
And Iâm your little queen
Red, white and blue
White and blue
(White and blue)
(White and blue)

Record executive I
Need you to live, I
Someone come replace you
Should I happen to meet you
Downtown, or see you
I would fall down dead
Iâm bereaved by you
Bereaved by you

In blue denim I meet you
Barefoot I need you
Diamond horseshoe sparklinâ
Youâre my king Jewish maven
Kids on vacation
Florida Keys are calling
Come back to me
Come back to me
