Lyrics:


Mandy! Mandy! 
Make up your mind!
Preacher man is handy, 
Mandy, easy to find.
Marching down the aisle with you, 
we'll make them all stare.
With a little Black-Eyed Susan 
stuck in your hair.
Mandy, Mandy, 
won't you decide?
Everything is dandy,
Mandy, once you are my bride.
In a year or two 
there may be three of a kind!
Listen to me, Mandy,  
make up your mind!
