Lyrics:


I want L.O.V.E.
I want that simple love for me
I got all the advice I need
I'm gonna let myself breathe
I want L.O.V.E.
I want that simple love for me
Cause I got all the advice I need
I'm gonna set myself free

Is there anything like simple love?
Would you please tell me
Will my heart just fill with love?
Would you please tell me
Will I fall in the arms of the right guy?
Will I stay for a while, will I change my mind?
These things I gotta know, I gotta know for sure
Cause I just want my simple, simple love, oh

I want L.O.V.E.
I want that simple love for me
I got all the advice I need
I'm gonna let myself breathe
I want L.O.V.E.
I want that simple love for me
Cause I got all the advice I need
I'm gonna set myself free

Is there anything like simple love?
Would you please tell me
Cause I just want to fall in love
Would you please tell me
Will I fall in the arms of the right guy?
Will I stay for a while, will I change my mind?
Cause I sing I gotta know, I gotta know for sure
Cause I just want my simple, simple love, oh yeah

I want L.O.V.E.
I want that simple love for me
I got all the advice I need
I'm gonna let myself breathe
I want L.O.V.E.
I want that simple love for me
Cause I got all the advice I need
I'm gonna set myself free

L.O.V.E.
Simple love for me
L.O.V.E.

No, no one said it would be easy
You gotta put everything on the line
What's the use?
When your broken heartache won't go away
No, no, no, no

I want L.O.V.E.
I want that simple love for me
Cause I got all the advice I need
I want L.O.V.E.
I want simple love for me
Cause I got all the advice I need, whoa
I want L.O.V.E, L.O.V.E.
Simple love for me
Cause I got all the advice I need

Will I fall in the arms of the right guy?
Will I stay for a while, will I change my mind?
Cause I sing I gotta know, I gotta know for sure
Cause I just want my simple, simple love, oh whoa

Will I fall in the arms of the right guy?
Will I stay for a while, will I change my mind?
Cause I sing I gotta know, I gotta know for sure
Cause I just want my simple, simple love, oh whoa
