Lyrics:


Fender mender give me a chance
I wanna make the people dance
Fender mender fix my guitar
I wanna be a real big record star

We wanna spend our days signin' autographs
And we wanna pose for millions of photographs
And we wanna make a movie before we're done
And we wanna have our song go to number one
And we wanna be the greatest group of all

Fender mender fix my guitar
I wanna be a record star
Fender mender it's up to you
I wanna do the things the Beatles do

We wanna hear ourselves on the radio
And we wanna see ourselves on the TV show
And we wanna make it big at the record hops
And we wanna sell out fast at the record shops
(Go! Go! Go!)
We wanna be the greatest group of all

I wanna be a real big record star

We wanna give a newspaper interview
And we wanna see the kids dress the way we do
And we wanna see ourselves in the magazines
And we wanna be a hero to all the teens
And we wanna be the greatest group of all

Fender mender fix my guitar
I wanna be a real big record star
I wanna be a real big record star
