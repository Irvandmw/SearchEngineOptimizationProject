Lyrics:


Snowbird (snowbird)
Come fly away! (come fly away!)
With me! (with me!) with me! (with me!)

Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean,
The unborn grass lies waitin' for it's coat to turn to green!
The snowbird sings the song he always sings,
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring!

When I was young, my heart was young then too,
Anything that it would tell me, that's the thing that I would do.
But now I feel such emptiness within,
For the thing I want the most in life is the thing that I can't win!

(spread your tiny wings and fly away...
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day!)
The one I love forever is untrue,
And if I could you know I that would fly away with you!

The breeze along the river seems to say,
That she'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay!
So little snowbird take me with you when you go,
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow!

[repeat last two verses]

If I could, you know that I would fly away with you!

Snowbird (snowbird)
Come fly away! (come fly away!)
With me! (with me!) with me! (with me!)
Little snowbird (snowbird)
Come fly away! (come fly away!)
With me! (with me!) with me! (with me!)
Little snowbird (snowbird)
Come fly away...
