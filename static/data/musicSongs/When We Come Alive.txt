Lyrics:


The sun goes down like a photograph
You try to stop time in the aftermath
But itâs gone, gone

Yesterday reads like a tragedy
I try not to lose whatâs left of me
But itâs gone
Yeah, but we carry on

We are fire
Burning brightly
You and I

We light the sky
When we ignite
When we come alive
When we come alive

It feels like I could get lost today
The winds in my mind get swept away
And Iâm gone, gone

And itâs one last time to the wishing well
I throw down the change and I wish them well
But theyâre gone
Yeah, but weâll carry on

We are our souls on fire
We are reaching higher
We are our souls on fire
When we come alive
When we come alive

We are fire
You and I

Strength, heart, soul, mind
