Lyrics:


If I stayed here, would you follow
Could we put time in a bottle
And forget all our to-do's
Pretend we checked in to a chateau
In a world with no tomorrows
Just time for me and you

Do you wanna go...
Anywhere, baby

I've got no plans for us today
Got no plans to get away
I've got no plans, except for loving you
I've got no plans for us tonight
So baby, hold me tight
I've got no plans, except for loving you

If we dream it we can be it
I'm putting all my feelings
Into spending time with you
I could sit right here all evening
Just listening to you breathing
And taking in the view

Do you wanna go
Anywhere, baby

I've got no plans for us today
Got no plans to get away
I've got no plans, except for loving you
I've got no plans for us tonight
So baby, hold me tight
I've got no plans, except for loving you
