Lyrics:


There's a house on Shady Lane
By the old cemetary where the dead remain
This place is haunted, so they say

With my two friends and a flashlight
We waited till midnight
Till we couldn't wait no more
We opened up that door

Did you hear that sound?
Did you hear that sound
Calling from the underground?
I think somebody's down there

We should go right now
We should leave right now
I don't think we're welcome here
And that's when she appeared, oh oh oh!

I'm scared of this old house
When the lights go out
All the ghosts come out at night
And they dance in the shadows of the moonlight
Don't open that cellar door
You've heard that one before
What goes in don't come out
And that's why I'm so scared of this old house

We tried to run but the door was locked
Our hearts beat louder than a kookoo clock
12:05, this old house came alive

Down at the end of the hallway
Past the cobwebs and bloodstains
In the beam of our flashlight 
Was the lady dressed in white

She didn't make a sound
She just stared us down
Floating in her wedding gown
Like she died right at the altar

Shivers down my spine
Have we lost our minds?
Let's just slowly back away
And after us she came, oh oh oh!

I'm scared of this old house
When the lights go out
All the ghosts come out at night
And they dance in the shadows of the moonlight
Don't open that cellar door
You've heard that one before
What goes in don't come out
And that's why I'm so scared of this old house

Shady Lane, Shady Lane
Everybody stay away
If you wanna stay alive
Don't go in that house at night

Shady Lane, Shady Lane
Everybody stay away
If you wanna stay alive
Don't go in that house at night

We all ran our separate ways
Down winding halls and secret passageways
I hid downstairs, I thought I could escape

I heard those footsteps behind me
Lord don't let her find me
Around my neck I felt her hands
I never even had a chance
My body hit the ground
And I never made it out, oh oh oh!

I'm scared of this old house
Everyone keep out
Beware the lady in white
Who walks these halls at midnight
Don't open that cellar door
She'll haunt you evermore
What goes in don't come out
And now I'm just a ghost in this old house

She still haunts me
She's always haunted me
