Lyrics:


You see me and I see you
Can't hide nothing 'cause it's all see-through
Don't be a fool enough to tell a lie
Satellite's watching up in the sky
And for all the world to know
What we do and where we go
Welcome to the fishbowl

You don't have to be famous now to be a star
Just get caught on video and there ya are
You just lost your privacy
Now you're swimmin' around in here with me
Everybody else may know
It's all a big freak show
Welcome to the fishbowl

Everybody's business is everybody's business
And it's big business now
Who's gonna be the first to get the story out?
Who loves who and where are they gonna meet?
Covert picture that proves they cheat
God, it's getting hard to breathe this way
Everybody's life is on display
It's gotten out of control
Tell me do you feel exposed?
Well, welcome to the fishbowl

Everybody's business is everybody's business
And it's big business now
We're all in here together and we can't get out
Welcome to the fishbowl

Everybody else may know
It's all a big freak show
Welcome to the fishbowl

And for all the world to know
What we do and where we go
Welcome to the fishbowl
Yeah, welcome to the fishbowl

(You had to chase this dream, you had to be a star)
Yeah, yeah welcome to the fishbowl
(A house in the hills, money, sex, boats, cars)
Yeah, yeah welcome to the fishbowl
(Well now you got a name that everybody knows)
Yeah, yeah welcome to the fishbowl
No need to cry or moan
Welcome to the fishbowl
