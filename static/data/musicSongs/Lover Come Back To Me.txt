Lyrics:


The sky is blue
And high above
The moon is new
And so is love
This aching heart of mine
Heart of mine is singing
Oh lover come on back to me, yeah

You came at last
Love had its day
But that day is past
And you've gone away
This eager heart of mine
Heart of mine is singing
Oh lover come on back to me, yeah

I remember every little thing you used to do
And I get so lo, so lonely
Every road I walk I walk along with you
No wonder, no wonder I get so, so lonely

The sky is blue
And high above
The moon is new
And so is love
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Oh lover come on back to me, yeah

This aching heart of mine
Heart of mine is singing
Oh lover come on back to me, yeah

This aching heart of mine
Heart of mine is singing
Oh lover come on back to me, yeah

I remember every little thing you used to do
And I get so lo, so lonely
Every road I walk I walk along with you
No wonder, no wonder I get so, so lonely

The sky is blue
And high above
The moon is new
And so is love
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Oh lover come on back to me
Oh lover come on back to me, yeah
