Lyrics:


There's a man in a suit at my front door
And he's got some paper in his hand
Says I got to come down to the station
And he hopes I'll take it like a man
'Cause they caught me taking what wasn't mine
And it looks like I'll be doin' time

Give me five minutes more
To tell my baby goodbye

Well they stood me up in front of a jury
And they told me what it was I'd done
And the judge said we're finding you guilty
I said judge I'm not the guilty one
There wasn't anything left I could say
'Cause they sentenced me to ninety days

Give me five minutes more
To tell my baby goodbye

Baby I got something to say
You know they're gonna put me away
It'll only be a matter of days
Then I'm coming back to you
Coming back to you
Coming back to you

Well they're gonna put some walls around me
And there's nothin' anyone can do
I'm gonna do my time in the county
And I hope that time is all that I lose
Maybe this won't be so bad
Woman don't you look sos sad

Give me five minutes more
To tell my baby goodbye
Give me five minutes more
To tell my baby goodbye
Give me five minutes more
To tell my baby goodbye
Give me five minutes more
To tell my baby goodbye
