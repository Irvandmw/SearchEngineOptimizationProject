Lyrics:


Somethingâs wrong and I can feel it 
And if the surface tension then breaks 
Then we will drown her in it all 

âCause you canât look me in the eye anymore 
But if you do itâs clear inside
Youâre fighting in the wood. 

But you canât hide, your shame tonight
And I can't take the words you cannot say 
So hush now and donât cry, 
Mistakes are a part of life. 

I wasnât born yesterday 
And I see it on your face. 
I wasnât born yesterday, 
And I am not your baby anymore. 
You took my heart and now is broke-n. 

So take your things, you gotta go now, 
Don't say a word, or it might go down, go down, go down (Ah ah ah)
And Iâll stay cool until you walk out 
But when youâre gone Iâll lie here hoping that I will not drown 

But you canât hide, your shame tonight
And I can't take the words you cannot say 
So hush now and donât cry, 
Mistakes are a part of life. 

I wasnât born yesterday 
And I see it on your face
I wasnât born yesterday, 
And I am not your baby anymore. 
You took my heart and now is broke-n. 

I ainât your baby anymore 
Donât call me baby 
Donât say a word because I know 
Donât call me baby 
I ainât your baby anymore 
Donât call me baby 
So save the word because I know 
Donât call me baby
