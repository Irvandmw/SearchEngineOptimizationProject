Lyrics:


For some time
I've been waiting for your star to shine
So bright
I should say that it's your right to hurt me, baby
If you wanted to
Oh, but love isn't cruel

And for some time
I've been singing you a lullaby
Each night whispering that
It's your right to hurt me, baby
If you wanted to
Oh, but love isn't cruel

That's why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that
This love isn't crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy

You gotta stand where (Stand where) I stand
Who could believe that you're holding my hand now
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy

For some time I've been pillow talking in my head
My heart's vulnerable, but in my bed I want you, baby
And all you put me through
Oh, but love isn't cruel

The other night I swear I saw you in my dream (Dream)
We didn't say too much, but I understood everything
That you could hurt me, baby, and I could hurt you too
Oh, but love isn't cruel

That's why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that this love isn't crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy

You gotta stand where (Stand where) I stand
And through the seasons I'm holding your hand now
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy

I want you back
And I feel it bad
(I know it and I feel it, yeah, this love it isn't crazy)
Every day, want you more, we were so insecure
Every day, learning more, we were so immature

I want you back
And I feel it bad
(I know it and I feel it, yeah, this love it isn't crazy)
Every day, want you more, we were so insecure
Every day, learning more, we were so immature

We got to hold on, baby
We could believe that
This love isn't crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy

You gotta stand where (Stand where) I stand
Who could believe that you're holding my hand now
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy
