Lyrics:


[Chris Brown and Jhene Aiko:]
Said I'm all up in my feelings
Doubled up on this shot
Got me feeling some type of way
Told you I hate you I don't mean it
And the only thing that I got
Is the pain that you've been feeding

Faded, faded, faded,
All because of you
Now my current situation,
Trying not to think of you,
Not to break the rules
But it always happens,
When I get this way
Just can't stop myself,

[Chris Brown and Jhene Aiko:]
So baby tonight
I'm blowing up your line
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight,
So I'll be I'll be drunk-texting, drunk-texting, drunk-texting you
Drunk-texting, drunk-texting you
Yeah baby I'll be drunk-texting, drunk-texting, drunk-texting you
Drunk-texting, drunk-texting you

[Chris Brown (Jhene Aiko):]
Drunk-texting you
(drunk-texting you)
Drunk-texting you
(drunk-texting you)

[Chris Brown and Jhene Aiko:]
I'm looking at my phone thinking
Am I gonna hit "Send" or nah?
It's gonna be one of them mornings
When I wake up and regret it
If I don't get no reply
I don't wanna make it obvious

That I'm faded, faded, faded
Off a drink or two
And you know how it goes,
This ain't nothing new
Why's it always happen, when I get this way?
No I just can't stop myself,

[Chris Brown and Jhene Aiko:]
So baby tonight
I'm blowing up your line
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight,
So I'll be I'll be drunk-texting, drunk-texting, drunk-texting you
Drunk-texting, drunk-texting you
Yeah baby I'll be drunk-texting, drunk-texting, drunk-texting you
Drunk-texting, drunk-texting you

[Chris Brown (Jhene Aiko):]
Intoxicated (intoxicated)
That's when I think of you the most
But after the toast, anything goes
When I put my pride aside
(I'll be doing the most)
Doing the most

[Chris Brown and Jhene Aiko:]
I done spent 1, 2, 3 AM thinkin' about you
Don't wanna be without you,
'Cause I'm on the liquid courage
I hope this shit is worth it,
'Cause if it ain't then it's all bad, all bad.

[Chris Brown and Jhene Aiko:]
So baby tonight
I'm blowing up your line
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight,
So I'll be I'll be drunk-texting, drunk-texting, drunk-texting you
Drunk-texting, drunk-texting you
Yeah baby I'll be drunk-texting, drunk-texting, drunk-texting you
Drunk-texting, drunk-texting you

[Chris Brown and Jhene Aiko:]
If by chance you're laying next to someone else right now
Girl, I hope I hope it's the worst sex ever
Hope it's the worst sex ever
