Jesus
Ayy
Bitch I'm the wave
Aye, aye
(Firzt on the track)
Turn up, turn up, turn up

Oh you must not know I'm that nig (must not know I'm that nig)
So you must not know I'm living (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Bitch I'm the wave)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Yeah, yeah)
I bought it and bought it, no limit (I'm bout it and bout it)
I'm diving in dollars, I'm swimming (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Bitch I'm the wave)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Yeah, yeah)

Woah
I got a whole lotta bitches and all of them love me (Love me)
And I do not fuck with broke niggas, 'cause I'm getting money
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know we count a whole lot of Benjamins, all of them dirty
(All of them dirty)
We ride around with extended clips, all of them thirties (Bah)
Go and put on it like jacket and hop on the wave (Wave, swoosh)
And I see you jacking my swagger, y'all niggas some lame (So lame)
They try to do what I do, but can't do it the same (No, no, no)
Water all over my chain, you can tell I'm the wave (Woah)

Oh you must not know I'm that nig (Must not know I'm that nig)
So you must not know I'm living (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Bitch I'm the wave)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Yeah, yeah)
I bought it and bought it, no limit (I'm bout it and bout it)
I'm diving in dollars, I'm swimming (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Bitch I'm the wave)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Yeah, yeah)

Woah
I'm dripping flavor, it feel like I'm walking on water
(Feel like I'm walking on water)
My bitches nasty, she suck me and let me record her
(Bless my soul)
You do what you want when you poppin'
I'm weaving and bobbing through traffic (Skrrt)
You mad 'cause you can't make it
And everything I drop is a classic (Classic, for real)
A whole lot of waves like Katrina
Call females, shout out to New Orleans (Orleans, yeah)
I had to cut off that bitch
'Cause I need some excitement, she boring (No, no)
Did you see the lock on they face
When I pulled up in that yellow foreign (Skrrt)
Now they treat me like Kevin Gates
They grab on my dick while I'm performing (Performing)

Oh you must not know I'm that nig (must not know I'm that nig)
So you must not know I'm living (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Bitch I'm the wave)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Yeah, yeah)
I bought it and bought it, no limit (I'm bout it and bout it)
I'm diving in dollars, I'm swimming (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Bitch I'm the wave)
Bitch, I'm the wave, you better catch up (Yeah, yeah)
