Lyrics:


I was like, "Hi, nice to meet ya"
I could see me in your t-shirt
I could hear love from the speakers
I could see us in front of a preacher
Saying, "I do" in my white dress
Felt so deep, I need a life vest
It don't usually happen like this
Nah, nah, nah, nah

And I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down
And I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down

They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you
They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you

This ain't no one night stand
Want your picture on my nightstand
Be my lover, be my best friend
Put that bling bling on my left hand
Sayin' what kind of love you're gon' put on me
'Cause your last name sounds good on me
What kind of love you're gon' put on me
'Cause your last name sounds good on me

And I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down

They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you
They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you

'Cause they say fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you
They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you

They say fools rush in
But I wanna be foolish with you
They say fools rush in
But I wanna be foolish with you

They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you
They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you

They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you
They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you

They say fools rush in
But I wanna be foolish with you
They say fools rush in
But I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you
