Lyrics:


Listen
If you think that we're here for the money
You couldn't be right, you know-ow-ow-ow
But the bread is not too good here
It wasn't always like that, you know
I said all you got to do is listen

Listen
If you don't hear what you can tell us
If it's good you can tell us all
Or you can smile, that's alright my friend
It could be so nice, you know
If only you would listen

Yeah listen
If you don't understand it, no no no no
You got to try to fly
And don't you put me down, please
For creating beyond your mind
I said all you got to do is listen
