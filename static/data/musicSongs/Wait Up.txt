Lyrics:


Baby Jesus
You already know about that
Yeah
Baby wait up
Heard you know a nigga

Baby, you don't know how much that I appreciate ya
I never, ever, ever underestimate ya
I can't even lie, girl your my motivation
But right now I got to go
I ain't got no time, I'm on the road (Skrrt)
I be rocking diamonds with the gold (Sold)
I done took over the town, it's getting old (Old)
And I'm gon' have to fuck with you, when I get home (Home)

So I took it, girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up
Girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up (Yeah)
Girl, you know a nigga
Girl, you know a nigga
Girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up (Wait up)
Girl, you know a nigga popping
Girl, you know a nigga popping
Girl, you know a nigga popping, I can't lay up (No)
Girl, you know you need to stop
Girl, you know a nigga popping
Girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up (Yeah, yeah)

You do what you want when you're popping (Pop)
Fly me a chick to the islands (To the uh)
First glass we sip with the partners (Ooh)
I like a bitch with no mileage (No mileage)
This what you get when you wait up (Wait up)
I'm way too busy to lay up (Lay up)
I just got off to her
And it ain't no question about what I'm doing
I'm coming to see you (Hey)
I told you I need you
Girl do you believe in me (Yeah)
I got the diamonds flooded in my Cuban link
See a young nigga shining (Shine)
I told you, it's all about timing (Time)
You waiting, you waiting, that's why you my favorite
Girl, I appreciate it so I had to tell

Baby, you don't know how much that I appreciate ya
I never, ever, ever underestimate ya
I can't even lie, girl your my motivation
But right now I got to go
I ain't got no time, I'm on the road (Skrrt)
I be rocking diamonds with the gold (Sold)
I done took over the town, it's getting old (Old)
And I'm gon' have to fuck with you, when I get home (Home)

So I took it, girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up
Girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up (Yeah)
Girl, you know a nigga
Girl, you know a nigga
Girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up (Wait up)
Girl, you know a nigga popping
Girl, you know a nigga popping
Girl, you know a nigga popping, I can't lay up (No)
Girl, you know you need to stop
Girl, you know a nigga popping
Girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up (Yeah, yeah)

You do what you want when you're popping (Pop)
She know I got bitches, I got options (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, I don't listen to gossip (No, no, no)
Fuck that, I'm switching the topic (Yeah)
This what you get when you wait up (Wait up)
Don't go to sleep, baby stay up (Stay up)
When your texts don't get finished
I'm coming straight over to give you the business
You better believe it (Aye, aye)
You know that I don't give a fuck what people think (No)
Them other bitches don't see what you see in me (Don't)
You know all of the words to my songs (Words to my songs)
You got all of them saved to your phone (Phone)
You stay down for a minute, that's why you the realest
Don't ever forget it

Baby, you don't know how much that I appreciate ya
I never, ever, ever underestimate ya
I can't even lie, girl your my motivation
But right now I got to go
I ain't got no time, I'm on the road (Skrrt)
I be rocking diamonds with the gold (Sold)
I done took over the town, it's getting old (Old)
And I'm gon' have to fuck with you, when I get home (Home)

So I took it, girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up
Girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up (Yeah)
Girl, you know a nigga
Girl, you know a nigga
Girl, you know a nigga popping, wait up (Wait up)
