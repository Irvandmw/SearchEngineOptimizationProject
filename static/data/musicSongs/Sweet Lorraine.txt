Lyrics:


Iâve just found joy
Iâm as happy as a baby boy
With another brand new choo-choo toy
When Iâm with my sweet Lorraine

A pair of eyes
That are bluer than the summer skies
When you see them you will realize
Why I love my sweet Lorraine

I'm so happy when it's raining, I donât miss the sun
For itâs in my sweetieâs smile
Just to think that Iâm the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle, yes

Each night I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
Just canât wait until that happy day
When I marry sweet Lorraine

Yes when it's raining, I donât miss the sun
For itâs in my sweetieâs smile, baby
Just to think that Iâm the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle

Yeah, each night I pray, yes
That nobody steals her heart away
Just canât wait until the lucky day
When I marry sweet Lorraine, yes

When the lucky day, yeah
When I marry sweet Lorraine
