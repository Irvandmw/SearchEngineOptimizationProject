Lyrics:


Baby, I can't wait for late December
Smell of cinnamon and pine
We'll be picking out the Christmas timber
And hanging up the fairy lights

We can have a party
You can sing the carols
We're not going out at all
I've got everything I need right here
There's no one else I need to call

'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Let the snow fall down, we're snuggled up inside
We got love with us
It's a good Christmas
Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime

Cozy up right by the fireplace and
Watch our favorite movies play
Cooking up a feast for kings and queens
Our castle is our sacred place

And we can have a party, dancing to the carols
We're not going out at all
I got everything I need right here
I know we're gonna have a ball

'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Let the snow fall down, we're snuggled up inside
We got love with us
It's a good Christmas
Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime

Make a Christmas vow
All we need is now
All we have is us
And we're more than enough
Now we've made this house a home
A beautiful world of our own
We'll do this every year
We're not leaving here

'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Let the snow fall down, we're snuggled up inside
We got love with us
It's a good Christmas
Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime

No place like home at Christmastime
No place like home at Christmastime
No place like home at Christmastime
No place like home at Christmastime

Oh baby, feels good to be home
Feels good to be home, yeah
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
[?] baby, yeah
