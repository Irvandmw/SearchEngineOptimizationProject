Lyrics:


[Girl:]
I saw you in that one video and was like
God, you knowwwww, you look so good
That was for one of the same ones
you know you've always wanted on TV but
You understand how excited I am, umm
Just so I remember, y'know
It it has a girl on the answering machine but
I think this is still you
I think that sometimes you don't like me the way I like you!
Just wanna KILL MYSELF or kill somebody, but
Then I don't because I think that if I die, y'know
you're still dead, then how are we gonna be together?
I just have to wait until you DIE then there's that working against us
So, I don't know, I don't want to kill anyone but
that's just how strong my love is for you
That I would kill you and then myself on some total
Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet type stuff
Just, so that I can prove to you, prove to the world, prove to my mom
Y'know even prove to my, psychiatrist
that y'know this is, this is deep, this is it right here
