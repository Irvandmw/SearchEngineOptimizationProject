Lyrics:


'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round

You see me standing there
And act like you don't know me
But last night you were calling me
Saying you want me

Oh why you always make me feel
Like I'm the one that's crazy
You feel my heart racing
My, my heart racing

Boy, I need you here with me
We can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say

We're going 'round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well you're gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy going
'Round and 'round and 'round

You try to pull me close
And whisper in my ear
You always told me lies
I've cried out all my tears

I push my feelings to the side
But then you bring them back
Bring-bring them back
Now you got me singing

Boy, I need you here with me
We can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say

We're going 'round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well you're gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy going
'Round and 'round and 'round

[2x]
Love me or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop

Boy, I need you here with me
I can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say

'Round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well you're gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy going
'Round and 'round and

'Round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well you're gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy going
'Round and 'round and 'round
