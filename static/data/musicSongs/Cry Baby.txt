Lyrics:


You seem to replace
Your brain with your heart
You take things so hard
And then you fall apart

You try to explain
But before you can start
Those cry baby tears
Come out of the dark

Someone's turning the handle
To that faucet in your eyes
You pour it out
Where everyone can see

Your heart's too big for your body
That's why it won't fit inside
You pour it out
Where everyone can see

They call you cry baby
Cry baby
But you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So you laugh through your tears

Cry baby, cry baby
'Cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
You'll just let them drown

You'll just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby

You're all on your own
And you lost all your friends
You told yourself that it's not you, it's them

You're one of a kind
And no one understands
But those cry baby tears keep coming back again

Someone's turning the handle
To that faucet in your eyes
You pour it out
Where everyone can see

Your heart's too big for your body
That's why it won't fit inside
You pour it out
Where everyone can see

They call you cry baby, cry baby
But you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So you laugh through your tears

Cry baby, cry baby
'Cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
You'll just let them drown

Cry baby, cry baby
You'll just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You'll just let them drown

I look at you and I see myself
And I know you better than anyone else
And I have the same faucet in my eyes
So your tears are mine

They call me cry baby, cry baby
But I don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
I laugh through my tears

Cry baby, cry baby
'Cause I don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
I'll just let them drown

Cry baby, cry baby
I'll just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You'll just let them drown

They call you cry baby, cry baby
I'll just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You'll just let them drown
