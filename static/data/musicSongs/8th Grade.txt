Lyrics:


I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless without no rules
Nothing to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life

That cigarette, put it out, put it out
Keep looking my way, turn around, turn around
This is a moment you can't buy
I see that longing in your eyes

Something is telling me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me then I was gone?
Better not be leading me on

I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless without no rules
Nothing to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life

I'm a confirmation should you feel unsure
I'm that security when you're insecure
I'll be that baby girl when you're immature
Don't be ambivalent towards me

Something is telling me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me then I was gone?
Better not be leading me on

I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless without no rules
Nothing to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not you life
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless without no rules (limitless)
Nothing to lose
Never no pressure (no pressure)
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life

(Break it down)
See I'm not your world
Nothing to lose
No pressure
Nothing
No pressure
No
I'm not your life
