Lyrics:


If you're like us
Calling all riders
Roll up beside
There's no place to hide us

All freedom fighters
Let's unite us
Switch on your nitrous
And let's go

Destination
For navigation
Man up your stations
Feel the sensation

Surround invasion
With communication
Move quick
We might avoid contamination

Down
Here comes the sound
Everyone pound
Your feet to this phenomenon
Now
Let's make it loud
Let's show 'em all how
You move to this phenomenon

Roll!
Open your soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
And let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon

Don't let these spiders
Crawl up beside us
They want to bite us
Inject the virus

Raise up your lighters
Praise to the righteous
Need you to guide us
Get prepared to go

If you're like us
Calling all riders
Roll up beside
There's no place to hide us

All freedom fighters
Let's unite us
Switch on your nitrous
And let's go

Down
Here comes the sound
Everyone pound
Your feet to this phenomenon
Now
Let's make it loud
Let's show 'em all how
You move to this phenomenon

Roll!
Open your soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
And let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon

Can't take it anymore
Shake until we move the floor
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

Tired of being ordinary
Don't care if there's people staring
Rely on your strength to carry
Me on

I'm not invisible like you
Next time things get a little messed up
I'll shine but I'll never be see through
I'm fine just trying to wake the rest up

Down
Here comes the sound
Everyone pound
Your feet to this phenomenon
Now
Let's make it loud
Let's show 'em all how
You move to this phenomenon

Roll!
Open your soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
And let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon
