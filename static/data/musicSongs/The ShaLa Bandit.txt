Sha-la-la-la, la, la, baby
Sha-la-la-la, la, la
Sha-la-la-la, la, la, baby
Sha-la-la-la, la, la

Girls, beware of the bandit from Westchester County
I can't offer you no reward, 'cause all he left me was a broken heart
He kidnapped me excitingly, and then he robbed me off my dignity
And when enough of his time had been spent, he left me
(Sha-la-la-la, la...) moaning... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Yeah
He left me (Sha-la-la-la, la...) moan, moaning... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Yes, he did... hey

Be careful, my sisters, yeah - he's armed with an innocent smile
With a dangerous love record that can stretch for miles and miles
Hey, girls! Take a hint - he don't leave no fingerprints
And if he gets his hands on you, he's gonna leave you
(Sha-la-la-la, la...) Wanting... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Yes, he will
And he'll leave you... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) moan, moaning... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Oh, yeah... yeah

Any female information concernin' this bandit person
He may be sitting right next to you, and Westchester County is right there too
Hey, girls! I've got a confession to make if they put that bandit in jail
I'll be the first one to go on his bail

He left me (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Wanting, oh, yeah... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) I'm a wanted woman this evening
He left me (Sha-la-la-la, la...) wanting, oh, yeah... (Sha-la-la-la, la...) Sha-la bandit, yeah, it's all about his
Sha-la-la-la, la... Ow
Sha-la-la-la, la... ah-ha, ha
Sha-la-la-la, la... ooh, baby
Sha-la-la-la, la... ah-ha, ha

Sha-la-la-la, la... but look so good to me, baby
Sha-la-la-la, la... ah-ha, ha
Sha-la-la-la, la... ow, baby
Sha-la-la-la, la... ah-ha, ha

Sha-la-la-la, la... he's a bandit
Sha-la-la-la, la... he's a terrible dude, y'all
Sha-la-la-la, la... hey, he's all for me
Sha-la-la-la, la... ah-ha, ha

Sha-la-la-la, la... Ooh, Good God Almighty
Sha-la-la-la, la... yeah-ha, ha
