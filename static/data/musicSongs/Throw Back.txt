Yo, yo, Baby Jesus, come on, man
What, bruh?
Yo, I got all your mixtapes, I listen to all your songs, I follow you on Instagram, and you gon' fuck my bitch? (Infamous)
Fuck it, bruh, I'ma tell you the truth, I'ma tell you the truth (Firzt on the track)

I hit her back in the day, she a throwback (For real)
I been there before and I ain't tryna go back (I can't)
Your girl is my ho and I bet you ain't know that (Your girl is a ho)
But you know how it go, ain't no way to control that (Know how it go)
Man, these bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (For real)
These bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (I know how you feel)
Man, these bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (Just keepin' it real)
These bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (I know how you feel)

Now, listen, I know why you feel how you feel (Why you feel how you feel)
Be cool, yeah, this shit gon' get real (This shit gon' get real)
Yeah, I hit your bitch in the passenger side of my lil' brother whip
Because she kept on callin' and textin' my phone
So I did what I did, shit, it is what it is
I'm just a nigga, I couldn't resist, what you gon' do?
Fuck around and get killed, for real
[?]
Superman, nigga, he savin' the bitch (Ha)
Gave me head, then she gave him a kiss (Muah)
And I'm 'bout to pass it to my nigga, though
I got 99 problems and all of 'em bitches, I feel just like Jigga, man (Woo)
Better give her more attention, if I catch you slippin', I might do this shit again, for real

I hit her back in the day, she a throwback (For real)
I been there before and I ain't tryna go back (I can't)
Your girl is my ho and I bet you ain't know that (Your girl is a ho)
But you know how it go, ain't no way to control that (Know how it go)
Man, these bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (Just keepin' it real; you got to know that by now)
These bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (You know what I'm sayin', that's just the way this shit go)
Man, these bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (Just let it go, let it go, bruh, L.I.G., L.I.G.)
These bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (Just keepin' it real; I know how you feel)

These goofy ass niggas be puppy lovin' (Roof)
Takin' the phone 'cause she up to somethin' (Ha)
He think he solvin' the mystery (What?)
He on her Instagram, all in the history
I done made her go say "Fuck a nigga" (Fuck him up)
Now she cheatin' on him with a couple niggas (Fuck him up)
I can't wait to see him out in public with her
I'ma walk up on her like I miss her (Hey)
Me and yo' bitch on the floor with her legs by her head and we ain't playin' Twister (Hey)
Watch how I do my lil' dance, leg in the air, that's how I hit (Woo)
Who is that at the front door? I'm out the back, straight out the wind (Yoo)
Can't be fuckin' with these bitches, I'll fuck around and be in prison, ayy
I'm gone

I hit her back in the day, she a throwback (For real)
I been there before and I ain't tryna go back (I can't)
Your girl is my ho and I bet you ain't know that (Your girl is a ho)
But you know how it go, ain't no way to control that (Know how it go)
Man, these bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (For real)
These bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (I know how you feel)
Man, these bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (Just keepin' it real)
These bitches for everybody, anybody can get it (I know how you feel)
