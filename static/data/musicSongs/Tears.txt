Lyrics:


I started out to be the man behind the scenes
Knowing I was in above my head
For all that I could see
I never saw the truth
Now I'm alone
Heaven only knows how much I'm missing you
Knowing I had heaven in my hands
And there will be tears
Tears are mixed with rain
Keeper of my flame
Time and tide is on my side, it stands forever
There will be nights of love and yes there will be tears

I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears tonight
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears

The silent telephone, the turning of the key
You're still inside of me , I'm not ashamed
For all that I can do , I can't forget your face
I call your name
Heaven only knows what I've been crying for , what I'm crying for
And all I've done to keep this love alive
Even through my tears
Tears are mixed with rain
Keeper of my flame
I will pray you're on my side, we stand forever
There will be nights of love and yes there will be tears

I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears tonight
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears

[break]

Soon there will be tears rollin' down my world
Keeper of my flame
Time and tide is on my side, it stands forever
There will be nights of love and yes there will be tears

I will not sleep tonight. There will be tears tonight
I will not sleep tonight. There will be tears
I will not sleep tonight. There will be tears tonight
I will not sleep tonight. There will be tears
