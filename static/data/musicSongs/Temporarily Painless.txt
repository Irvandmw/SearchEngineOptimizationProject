Lyrics:


We don't have to explain it
The beat is way too loud
Even though the light's faded
I still saw you in the crowd
When I put you in my arm
Feel it all through me
When you promise me nothing
You give me everything I need

She comes over
We're both not sober
It's like we're losing our minds
We kiss like lovers
And Cupid hovers
Like he's just learning to fly
And even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger

No need to justify
Looking for a little bit of love tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
No need to justify
All I wanna be is your drug tonight

I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody

Don't even know what your name is
When I taste your skin
I don't wanna sound shameless
I just wanna bring your body in
Wanna put you in my place
Pay to hear you scream
You don't even have to stay
Oh but I don't think you wanna leave

She comes over
We're both not sober
It's like we're losing our minds
We kiss like lovers
And Cupid hovers
Like he's just learning to fly
And even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger

No need to justify
Looking for a little bit of love tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
No need to justify
All I wanna be is your drug tonight

I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody

And even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger
Even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger

No need to justify
Looking for a little bit of love tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
No need to justify
All I wanna be is your drug tonight

I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody
You need somebody too
