Lyrics:


West coast
This oneâs for you
Alright

Cause we're California cruisinâ
California cruisinâ
We're California cruisinâ
Look where we got
California cruisinâ
Look where we got
Look where we got baby
Look where we got
Look where we got baby

Cruising down hollywood
Windows down, feelin' good, yeah
Feeling better than Iâve ever been, it must be adrenaline
As we're cruisin' down Sunset all night, all night

Cause we're California cruising
California cruisinâ
We're California cruisinâ
California cruisinâ
California cruisinâ
Look where we got
Look where we got baby

101 is backed up, Laurel canyon is a way to go
Windows down, matte black truck
I can take it where you wanna go
Venice beach, you can see clear, almost as pretty as you dear
[?] indeed, you should make it clear, roll out

Cause we're California cruisinâ
California cruisinâ
We're California cruisinâ
California cruisinâ
Look where we got
Look where we got baby
