You and me
Yeah, we, gotta fix this family
And I know, it's hard
But, oh, we at least gotta start

Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family
Ya see, it takes two to get to three relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family
Ya see, it takes two to get to three relieved
We're gonna leave here happily

You (Yes, you, yes, you) and me (And me)
Yeah, we, make pods, we da' peas
Now let's go (Let's go, let's go) get knee (Get knee)
Get knee, yes, deep and happy fantasies

Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family
Ya see, it takes two to get to three relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family
Ya see, it takes two to get to three relieved
We're gonna leave here happily

You and me, you best believe
'Mily, ya see, get to three relieved
We're gonna leave here happily

Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We're gonna fix this family
Ya see, it takes two to get to three relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
