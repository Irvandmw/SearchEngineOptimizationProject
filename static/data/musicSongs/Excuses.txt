Lyrics:


Always stayin' out late, get off at 8
But you come to door at 3
Name on your phone says caller unknown
But girl you ain't foolin' me
I can see it in your eyes and all the shh you hide

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

Say you're out with your friends, try to pretend
Like I don't know what you're doing
It's funny to me, the joke is on you
And girl I see through it

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid
Girl you ain't foolin' me

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses
