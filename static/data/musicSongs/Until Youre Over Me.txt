Lyrics:


This relationship is over
Though my stomach still hurts
And now I'm gonna live alone
Why is the pain much worse?

Look so much better without make-up
Why would you hide your face?
Don't want to spend the night and wake up
Realize I've made a big mistake

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast. I know you're there
I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I am still in love with you

I never meant to keep you waiting
And now your food is getting cold
I keep denying I'm in love with you
My routine is getting old

And now you stand up from the table
And say you never look back
Do something stupid when you're angry
You only wake up sad

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast, I know you're there
I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I'm still in love with you
It hurts so much to know the truth
But I'm still in love with you

No more kisses on your lips and tender touches, please
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees
And all the cuts you gave me open up and start to bleed
And I just can't get over you until you're over me

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care

And I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I'm still in love with you
It hurts so much to know the truth
But I'm still in love with you
