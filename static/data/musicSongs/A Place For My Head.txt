Lyrics:


[Mike Shinoda:]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one

It makes me think of how you act for me
You do favors and then rapidly
Just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy,
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Mike Shinoda:]
Maybe someday I'll be just like you
And step on people like you do
And run away of the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were

You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone

[Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington:]
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy,
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Chester Bennington 8x:]
You try to take the best of me
Go away

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy,
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Chester Bennington:]
Stay aâway!

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
I'm so sick of the tension (stay)
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (aâ)
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension (âway)
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (stay away from me)
While I find a place to rest
