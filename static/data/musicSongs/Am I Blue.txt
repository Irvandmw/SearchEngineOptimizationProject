Lyrics:


Oh am I blue
Am I blue
Ain't these tears in my eyes tellin' you
Well am I blue
You'd be too
If each plan that you had, done and fell through

There was a time I was your only one
but now I'm the sad and lonely one
Was I gay
I should say
Now she's gone and we're through
Am I blue

Am I blue
Am I blue
Ain't these tears in my eyes tellin' you
Well am I blue
You'd be too
If each plan that you had, done and fell through

There was a time I was your only one
but now I'm the sad and lonely one
Was I gay
I should say
Now she's gone and we're through
Am I blue
