Lyrics:


I've fixed my dwelling for the night
Lights in pairs come passing by
Where I hide
I need some time now on my own
Leave my loneliness alone
To lick my wounds
Night has found me just in time
To help me close my eyes
One more time

Living a boy's adventure tale
In so many ways
Living a boy's adventure tale
For so many days
I'm living a boy's adventure tale
Can't escape, if I wanted to
Living a boy's adventure tale
I may be dreaming but I feel awake

I've been lost in so many places
Seeking love in so many faces
A change of weather,
The rain pours down
My head in hands,
Pressed to the ground
And where am I supposed to go now

Living a boy's adventure tale
In so many ways
Living a boy's adventure tale (ah)
Living a boy's adventure tale
A voice I hear
Living a boy's adventure tale
Singing a lullaby for me
Living a boy's adventure tale
Because of you
Living a boy's adventure tale
Oh you know it's true
Living a boy's adventure tale
In so many ways (ah)
For so many days
I love you. I love you
So many ways

I love her
I love her
I love her
