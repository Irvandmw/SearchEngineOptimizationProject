Lyrics:


What you gonna do when the drugs run out
Standing in the street with your tits out
Bonnie I want you
Bonnie I want you
What you gonna do when the sun comes up
Trying to get a ride with the fuck-ups
Bonnie I want you
Bonnie I want you

Once you know the way out
It's even harder to stay out
Once you know the things they're saying
You know all of the games they're playing
Only thing that's true
Is Bonnie I want you

What you gonna do when the buzz wears off
And you wake up in the corner with your clothes off
Bonnie I want you
Bonnie I want you
What you gonna do when the truth sets in
And nobody's around to sink your teeth in
Bonnie I want you
Bonnie I want you

Once you know the way out
It's even harder to stay out
Once you know the things they're saying
You know all of the games they're playing
Only thing that's true
Is Bonnie I want you

1, 2, 3, the radio's playing
4, 5, 6, the chemical's fading
7, 8, 9, 10, I wanna see you again
1, 2, 3, the radio's playing
4, 5, 6, the chemical's fading
7, 8, 9, 10, I wanna see you again

What you gonna do when the drugs run out
Standing in the street with your tits out
Bonnie I want you
Bonnie I want you
What you gonna do when the sun comes up
Trying to get a ride with the fuck-ups
Bonnie I want you
Bonnie I want you

Once you know the way out
It's even harder to stay out
Once you know the things they're saying
You know all of the games they're playing
Only thing that's true
Is Bonnie I want you

1, 2, 3, the radio's playing
4, 5, 6, the chemical's fading
7, 8, 9, 10, I wanna see you again
1, 2, 3, the radio's playing
4, 5, 6, the chemical's fading
7, 8, 9, 10, I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
