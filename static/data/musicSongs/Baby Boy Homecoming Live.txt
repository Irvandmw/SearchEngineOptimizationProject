Sing it Sean
Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies (Come on girl, tell me how you feel)
I think about you all the time
I see you you in my dreams
Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies (Come on girl, tell me what's the deal)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams (I see you in my dreams)

Ahh, oh, my baby's fly, baby go
Yes, no, hurt me so good, baby, oh
I'm so wrapped up in your love, let me go
Uh, let me breathe, stay out my fantasies

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Baby boy, you are so damn fine (So do you know what this means?)
Baby boy, won't you be mine? (I want you to do it)
Baby boy, let's conceive an angel (Here we go!)

Top, top girl
Me and you together is a wrap, dat girl
Driving 'round da town in your drop top, girl
You no stop shock girl
Little more da dutty, we'll rock dat work
Little more da dutty, we'll
Little more da dutty, we'll
Little more da dutty, we'll
Little more da dutty, we'll rock dat work
