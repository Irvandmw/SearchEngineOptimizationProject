Lyrics:


My last nigga was a bitch nigga
I need a nigga with bout 6 figures, yeah
Someone who know what to do with it, yeah
Someone who ain't on that goofy shit
I need to know what you gone do
I ain't tryna go through DÃ©jÃ  vu
It's some bullshit that I went through
Hope its not the same with you

Come make me feel a way
Taste till I levitate, yeah
Relieve all the pain
Make me forget those things
Oh, I wanna lay with you
See what this thing could do, yeah
Put me on something new
Put me on 'cause

I want something
Something that I can feel
I want something
That I know is real
I want something
Something that I can feel
Come and put me on the real, real, real

And I know you ain't never have nobody in your life
That'll come through and do you right
Why don't you let me change your life, girl?
I'm tryna put that wrist underwater (See the drip)
Girl I might just give you a daughter
Girl I know, baby that it's real
Let me show you how it feels

I'ma make you feel a way
Taste till you levitate
Let me relieve all your pain
Make you forget those things
Girl I wanna lay with you
And show you what this thing gone do to you
Put you on something new
I'll put you on on on

I want something
Something that I can feel
I want something
That I know is real
I want something
Something that I can feel
Come and put me on the real, real, real

I have yet to see the real
I need something I can feel oh
I have yet to see the real (I won't ever change up)
I want something I can feel
Girl you know how I feel, can feel
Can't you see the real I want it (Yeah)
I want something that I can feel
