Song Name: I Get A Kick Out Of You
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


My story is much too sad to be told,
But practically everything leaves me totally cold.
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree,
Fighting vainly the old ennui,
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face.

I get no kick from champagne.
Mere alcohol
Doesn't thrill me at all.
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Someâthey may go for cocaine.
I'm sure that if
I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too.
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me.
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously
Do not adore me.

I get no kick in a plane.
Flying too high
With some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do.
Yet I get a kickâum, you give me a bootâI get a kick out of you.
