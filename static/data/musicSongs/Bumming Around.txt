Lyrics:


I got an ol' slouch hat, 
Got my roll on my shoulder 
I'm as free as a breeze 
An' do as I please, 
Just a bummin' around 

Gotta million friends, 
I don't feel any older 
I've got nothin' to lose 
Not even the blues, 
Just a bummin' around 

Whenever worries start 
To botherin' me ( start botherin' me!) 
I grab my coat, my ol' slouch hat, 
Hit the trail again, 
You see 

I ain't got a dime, 
Don't care where I'm goin' 
I'm as free as a breeze 
An' do as I please, 
Just a bummin' around! 

I hit the trail again, 
You see 

I ain't got a dime, 
Don't care where I'm goin' 
I'm as free as a breeze 
An' do as I please, 
Just a bummin' around 

Just a bummin' around 
Just a bummin' around 
Just a bummin' around
