Lyrics:


[Intro:]
Owww, woow, shes so beautiful
Nah I'm talking about you move to the left baby
I'm talkin about the car, ha
I'm just playin baby

Now all my players in the house, all my players in the house tonight, come on
Now all my ladies in the house I can make you feel incredibly right, uh

[Verse 1:]
Now this for all the guys who tricking on all the women I know
Writing love notes like I paid the note on your tahoe
Purchasing more than nachos, chocolates and moskados
Say she your darling and you balling like chicago
You giving her d. rose you trying to be mvp man
Most valuable player you should throw your defeat in
Love her and never cheating you eating and never skeeting
Lean in the car and kiss me before she can get her feet in
Eyy,
That just mean that she couldn't wait
She tell me I smell good I tell her she looking great
She say that she love the car to get it what did it take
I say this isn't a rental it didn't come with a rate, we late
Let off the brakes and then we proceed to coast
I tell her that if she wants she can get as high as the slopes
She say that she doesn't smoke do you I tell her nope
And that one word got her wet as a bar of soap
Let's open an envelope we gotta give an award
To someone who could pull them by never saying a word
Before ever leaving the curb without opening liquor and never breaking an herb
I know this don't sound possible to some of you lames
Bout to strain your whole brain tryna get her ta change
You got to name drop names of every person you came
In contact with in your life that's just terrible game
Ain't gotta spend a milli on her and be living the lie
Just be playa you should give it a try
And if you know your never ever tricking on no woman like I
Then all my players put your hands in the sky, one mo time

[Chorus:]
Ain't gotta spend a milli on her and be living a lie
Just be a playa you should give it a try
And if you know your never ever tricking on no woman like I
Then all my players put your hands in the sky

You gotsta be the baddest
You gotsta be the baddest girl
You gotsta be the baddest
You gotsta be the baddest girl

[Verse 2:]
You know you gotsta be the baddest
If you really goin make me add this
6 dollars and 55 cents to my tab miss
Wait a second just do the math if
This equals a drink then it also equals your address
Haha I'm just playing nah I'm just serious
Object in the mirror is clearer than it appear it is
Every girl that's hearing this wanna ride a luxurious
Mercedes for ladies with the upgraded interiors
Yea roam with a player that got experience
Stuntin and feelin on all of your different areas
Playin spin the bottle till we both get delerious
Curosity killed the cat just call me curious
Because you know I'm bout to kill it tonight
All my players put your hands in the sky
And ladies you say you partuin with us and say you bringina freind as fine you it better not be a tie
Cause you gotsta be the baddest
Really your friend is average
You dope and your friend shady it's like I'm cashis
Really she should relax if I'm talking to you then why is she saying your ad libs (you bad miss)
Nah I don't trust her she got a fast lip
If her mouth could run I know hers would run a lap quick
Fast chick if she ain't a snake then she an actress
Leave her alone with me well see how cut that the grass is

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You know I lost a little venom the lyrics are still as toxic
Lookin at my watch she notice it ain't a clock tick
None of em successful when ever they try to lock chicks
Cause in another life I probably coulda bein a locksmith
Hear boys sayin nah he ain't messin with my chick
Now she shotgun and that's why they call it the cockpit
Then I see you in your lil designer outfit
And look at you what is that velvet nah just ostrich
You fly you even bought you a tie
I walked right past her and didn't even say hi
She turned and watched me walk past and yell bye
I'm wondering what I said to even make her reply
I guess that's how it goes when your dealing with pro's
I'm really ssayin nothin and she know to remove her clothes
Ain't taking none of these hoes you know to papadeuxs
I'm pulling up to the curb and then I'm just popping dows
Get out
