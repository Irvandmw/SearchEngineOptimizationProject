Lyrics:


Cold hands, red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there, for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls, don't talk
And if they could they'd say
Can't hide, your secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

I know right now, you feel alone
And all the good things, they hurt the most
But it's a long way done, yeah it's a long way down

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
