Lyrics:


I can't forget your mem'ry haunts me yet
I can't forget the way you used hold me so tight
Day after day my thoughts just seem to stray
Back to those happy days and to those wonderful nights
Your smiling face when my world turned away
Gave me the strength to go on through each blue day
I can recall the magic of it all but I can't help remembering you
Your smiling face...
