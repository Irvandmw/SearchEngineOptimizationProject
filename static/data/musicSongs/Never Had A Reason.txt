Lyrics:


I never had a reason
To stay home on Friday nights and be
Content with doing nothing but
Some TV and unwind

For heat that old cast iron skillet
On a lazy Sunday morning
And scramble up some eggs and brew
A big ole pot of coffee

I'd never really learned to cook for two
I'd never had a reason

Now I've got your smile, waking up my world
And I've got your eyes, to lose myself in girl
And I've got your life, to put before, mine

I never had a reason
To leave a note there on the counter
Just to tell the girl I love her and
That I can't live without her

All the things I thought I'd never do
'Cause I never had a reason

Now I've got your smile, waking up my world
And I've got your eyes, to lose myself in girl
And I've got your life, to put before, mine!

Now I've got your smile, waking up my world
And I've got your eyes, to lose myself in girl
And I've got your life, to put before, mine!

I never had a reason
To call up my folks and say
There's someone they gotta meet
And that I've never felt this way

Always wanted to show someone my hometown
But I never had a reason
No, I never had a reason
