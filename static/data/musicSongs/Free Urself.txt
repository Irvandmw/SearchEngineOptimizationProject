Lyrics:


How did we get here
How did we get this far?
How did we get so high
High enough to touch the stars?
If you could (if you could)
Wouldn't you like to fly?
Just because (just because)
Ain't no reason not to try

Free yourself (free yourself)
And save a place for me (yeah)
Life is what you make it
Be the best that you can be (oh yeah)
Now's the time (now's the time)
Take your place in history (yeah)
Yours and mine
The happy and the free (yeah)

Look at where we came from
How far we are today
We the people (we the people)
Will get the final say
Third apartment from the sun
Nothing left to fear
No need to hide or run
Heaven on earth right here
That's why you got to

Free yourself (free yourself)
And save a place for me (yeah)
Life is what you make it
Be the best that you can be (oh yeah)
Now's the time (now's the time)
Take your place in history (yeah)
Yours and mine
The happy and the free (yeah)

Love yourself
So we can love you too
We need your help
There's so much work to do
Love yourself
So we can love you too
We need your help

Free, free yourself
Free yourself
Free, free yourself
Free yourself
Free, free yourself
Free yourself
Free, free yourself
Free yourself
