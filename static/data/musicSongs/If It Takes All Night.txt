Lyrics:


You think I'm just coming on to you
I know exactly what I got to do
Your eyes kinda give the game away
I know exactly what your tryna say

But I'm not gonna give up
I'll prove to you I'm good enough
Just take your chance, I'll show you love
Put your trust in me girl,
I'm not like the other guys
Won't break your heart and tell you lies
Before you start to criticise
Put you trust in me girl.

IF it takes all night
Gonna give my love to you,
Gonna get it right if it takes all night
If it takes all night
Gonna give it up to you,
Gonna get it right if it takes all night

I know all about the other kind
One thing playing on a one-track mind
You'll see it's not the way it has to be
If you would only give your love to me

But I'm not gonna give up
I'll prove to you I'm good enough
Just take your chance, I'll show you love
Put your trust in me girl,
I'm not like the other guys
Won't break your heart and tell you lies
Before you start to criticise
Put you trust in me girl.

If it takes all night
Gonna give my love to you
Gonna get it right if it takes all night
If it takes up night
Gonna give it all to you
Gonna get it right if it takes all night

Watching and waiting
Just anticipating
The moment you come in my life
Hoping and praying
You hear what I'm saying
Tonight, oh tonight

If it takes all night
Gonna give my love to you
Gonna get it right if it takes all night
If it takes all night
Gonna give it up to you,

If it takes all night
Gonna give my love to you
Gonna get it right if it takes all night
If it takes all night
Gonna give it up to you,

If it takes all night
Gonna give my love to you
Gonna get it right if it takes all night
If it takes all night
Gonna give it up to you
Gonna get it right if it takes all night

If it takes all night
Gonna give my love to you,
