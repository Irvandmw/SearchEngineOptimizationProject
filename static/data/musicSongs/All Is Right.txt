Lyrics:


Close your eyes
Make a wish tonight
And search the skies 'cause it's time to fly
I'm comin' home
Where I belong
And that's the greatest gift of all

We'll all be singin' silent night
With a fire so bright
All is right with the world at Christmas time
You know it's just a state of mind
And I feel so alive
All is right with the world at Christmas time

We gather round the tree
All the family
It's so easy to see just what we need

We'll all be singin' silent night
With a fire so bright
All is right with the world at Christmas time
You know it's just a state of mind
And I feel so alive
All is right with the world at Christmas time

You and me and all our family
I got everything I need

We'll all be singin' silent night
With a fire so bright
All is right with the world at Christmas time
You know it's just a state of mind
And I feel so alive
All is right with the world at Christmas time
