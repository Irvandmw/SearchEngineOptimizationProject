Lyrics:


I tell myself I love you
Because I really care
I tell myself I need you
But is that really fair
I really truly love you
And I'll always be there
Just don't know how to tell you
I don't wanna be here

I can be the friend that I was to you
Like we were right from the start
I can be right there where you want me to
Even a million miles apart

I gave you every part of me that I could
But the one thing I can't give you

Is my heart
Is my heart

I wish that I could lie to you
But feelings are sincere
But every time I try to
It kinda disappears
I know how much you love me, ooh
And you want me to love you
But every time I try to, ooh
The feelings ain't there

I can be your friend like we used to be
Like we were right from the start
I can be right there when you call me up
Even a million miles apart

I gave you every part of me that I could
But the one thing I can't give you

Is my heart
Is my heart

I gave you every part of me that I could
But the one thing I can't give you

Is my heart
Is my heart
Is my heart
Is my heart

I can't give you...
I can't give you...
Can't give you my heart
