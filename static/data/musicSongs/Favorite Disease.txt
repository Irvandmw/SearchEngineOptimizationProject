Lyrics:


Wanting, watching, debating
On which way to run to
Haunted voices craving
Someone to run to

I haven't lost myself in a long time
I never tried to care when I wanted to
I just wanna be part of something
I just wanna be real like you

Sometimes I feel like a monster
And times I feel like a saint
I'm on my knees, you're my favourite disease

Silent warnings tell me
I've let things come undone
Show me, teach me
The way to Heaven
'Cause no other way can

I haven't lost myself in a long time
I never tried to care when I wanted to
I just wanted to be part of something
I just wanted to be real like you

Sometimes I feel like a monster
And times I feel like a saint
I'm on my knees, you're my favourite disease

Closer, closer, closer to you
I need to be closer
I have closure and get closer to you
With every step I take

Sometimes I feel like a monster
And times I feel like a saint
I'm on my knees, you're my favourite disease
And I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me

Sometimes I feel like a monster
And times I feel like a saint
I'm on my knees, you're my favourite disease
And I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me

I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
I love the way you kill me
Love the way you heal me
