Lyrics:


Dance, dance, dance, dance
Just dance, oh get over here baby

Found out just the other day
That you were giving it away
I found out just the other day
I ain't gonna make you stay
You told me that you'd never hurt me
You made me believe that you love me

I don't give a damn, I just wanna dance the love away
I don't even care, I just wanna dance the love away
I just wanna dance, dance dance, dance (just dance)
Oh get over here baby
I just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance (just dance)
I just wanna
Oh get over here
Oh get over here

I just found out yesterday
Your best friends keep telling me
I just found out yesterday
You were out with somebody
You promised me I was the only
Tonight you'll see I won't be lonely

I don't give a damn, I just wanna dance the love away
I don't even care, I'm just gonna dance the love away
I just wanna dance, dance dance, dance (just dance)
Oh get over here baby
I just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance
(Just dance, just dance, just dance)
Oh get over here baby
Oh get over here

Watch how I get over you
DJ can you help me to
Turn it up so I can move
Right now, don't stop

I just wanna dance

I don't really care, I'm just gonna dance
I just wanna dance, dance dance, dance (just dance)
I'll get over you baby
I just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance
(Just dance, just dance, just dance, just dance, just dance)
I'll get over you baby
I'll get over you
I'll get over you
I just wanna
Dance
I'll get over you
