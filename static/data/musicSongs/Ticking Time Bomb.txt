Lyrics:


[Chorus:]
You may think Iâm harmless 
You could not be more wrong
Careful what you do I am just a ticking time bomb
You may think Iâm laughing
You couldnât be more stupid 
Iâm laughing âcause I know that someday this ticking time bomb will explode

[Verse 1:]
If I said what Iâve been thinking 
they would lock me up for good
I know you just wonât understand me 
like the unabomber would 
It appears to you Iâm so together 
but my plans are so much bigger than this 

[Chorus:]
You may think Iâm harmless 
You could not be more wrong
Careful what you do I am just a ticking time bomb
You may think Iâm laughing
You couldnât be more stupid 
Iâm laughing âcause I know that someday this ticking time bomb will explode

[Verse 2:]
Everyday I see a new thing
that makes me wanna start a fight 
But I just stack the ammunition 
and let the pressure build inside 
It appears to you Iâm so together 
but my plans are so much bigger than this

[Chorus:]
You may think Iâm harmless 
You could not be more wrong
Careful what you do I am just a ticking time bomb
You may think Iâm laughing
You couldnât be more stupid 
Iâm laughing âcause I know that someday this ticking time bomb will explode
Explode, explode, exploding. [x2]

[Bridge:]
I kiss so soft and sweetly 
And you feel so safe beinâ with me 
But I try so hard to be happy 
Boy you make it look easy

[Chorus:]
You may think Iâm harmless 
You could not be more wrong
Careful what you do I am just a ticking time bomb
You may think Iâm laughing
You couldnât be more stupid 
Iâm laughing âcause I know that someday this ticking time bomb will explode 
Explode, explode, exploding. [x2]
