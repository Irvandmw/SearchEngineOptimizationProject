Lyrics:


Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feelings getting stronger
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss covered vines
The tall sugar pines
Where mockin' birds use to sing
And I'd like to see the lazy Mississippi
A hurryin' into spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in June
And soon I'm wishing that I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's something more
I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans

The moonlight on the bayou
A creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in June
And soon I'm wishing that I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's something more
I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans
More than I miss New Orleans
