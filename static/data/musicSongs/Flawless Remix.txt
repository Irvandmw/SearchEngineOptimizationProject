Lyrics:


Dum-da-de-da
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Coming down, dripping candy on the ground

It's that YoncÃ©, your YoncÃ© in that lingerie
On that chardonnay, scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B, and I'm redboned yo
I'm really rit like Donjae, I'm camo in here yo
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your poundcake
Boy you know I look good as fuck
You wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no
We escalating, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha, ha, God damn, God damn, God damn

Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine
I'm flawless

You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say, "I look so good tonight."
God damn, God damn
Say, "I look so good tonight."
God damn, God damn, God damn

I wake up looking this good
(God damn, God damn, God damn)
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I if I, if I, if I)
And you can say what you want, I'm the shit
(What you want I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn

[Nicki Minaj:]
Looking Trinidadian, Japanese and Indian
Got Malaysian, got that yaki, that wavy Brazilian

[Beyonce:]
(Them bitches thirsty) UHN! (I'm Hungarian)
(Nicki, BB, be eating diamond fangs, barbarian, RAAAAH!)

[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, like MJ's doctor, they killing me
Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell 'em winning is my motherfuckin' protocol
'Cause I score before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and ain't no fuckin' soap involved, uh
This every hood nigga dream, fantasizing about Nicki and Bey
Curvalicious, pussy served delicious
Mayday mayday, earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass like we birthing bitches, uh
The queen of rap, slayin with Queen Bey
If you ain't on the team, you playin' for team D
'Cause we A-listers, we paid sisters
This watch right here done phased blizzards
I confess, I woke up like this
All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick
Instagram another flawless pic
Flawless city with these flawless titties
I got all these hundreds, you got all them fifties
I'm with some flawless bitches because they more than pretty
'Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back I be on my frisbee
Princess cut diamonds, on my Disney
He want "Monster Nicki", in Sri Lanka
I told him, "Meet me at the Trump, Ivanka"
I said come here let me show you how this cookie taste
This that yeah, nigga, eat that cookie face

Right, right, right
