Lyrics:


Well come on over baby, whole lotta shakin' goin' on
I said come on over baby, baby you can't go wrong
We ain't fakin', whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Well I said come on over baby, we got a chicken in the barn
I said come on over baby, really got the bull by the horn
We ain't fakin', whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Well I said shake baby shake, I said shake baby shake
I said shake baby shake, well shake baby shake
Come on over, whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Aw let's go now

Well come on over baby, we got a chicken in the barn
Who's barn?, what barn?, my barn
Come on over baby, really got the bull by the horn
We ain't fakin', whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Easy now

Shake, oh shake it baby, yeah
Shake it one time for me
Well come on over, whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Let's get real low now

Shake, baby shake

All you gotta do honey is kinda stand in one spot
Wiggle 'round just a little bit
That's when ya got it, yeah
Oh baby a whole lotta shakin' goin on

Go one time now

Shake it baby, shake, shake it baby shake
Ooh shake babe, come on babe, shake baby shake
Come on over, whole lotta shakin' goin' on
