Lyrics:


Yeah, they think that I'm afraid to fall (afraid to fall, afraid to fall)
But you know that I ain't afraid at all
Yeah, they think that I'm afraid to fall (afraid to fall, afraid to fall)
But you know that I ain't afraid at all

I ain't afraid at all, oh
I ain't afraid at all, oh
I ain't afraid at all, oh
I ain't afraid at all, oh

Let it breathe, (let it breathe, let it breathe)
Let it breathe, (let it breathe, let it breathe)
Let it breathe, (let it breathe, let it breathe)
Let it breathe, (let it breathe, let it breathe)
Yeah, let it breathe

Yeah, they think that I'm afraid to fall (afraid to fall, afraid to fall)
But you know that I ain't afraid at all
Yeah, they think that I'm afraid to fall (afraid to fall, afraid to fall)
But you know that I ain't afraid at all

I ain't afraid at all, oh
I ain't afraid at all, oh
I ain't afraid at all, oh
I ain't afraid at all, oh

Let it breathe, (let it breathe, let it breathe)
Let it breathe, (let it breathe, let it breathe)
Let it breathe, (let it breathe, let it breathe)
Let it breathe, (let it breathe, let it breathe)
Yeah, let it breathe
