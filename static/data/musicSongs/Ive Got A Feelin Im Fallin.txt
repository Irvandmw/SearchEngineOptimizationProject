Lyrics:


I'm flyin' high, but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you
You caught my eye, and I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Show me the ring and I'll jump right through!

I used to travel single-o, we chanced to mingle-o
Now I'm a tingle over you
Hey mister parson stand by, for I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you!

(yes, it's a plain to see that he's flyin' high
And we've got a feelin' he's fallin'...)

I'm a fallin' for nobody else but you!
(no one else will do, since you,
Caught his eye and we've got a feelin' he's fallin'...)
I'm a fallin' for nobody else but you!
I used to travel single-o, we chanced to mingle-o
Now I'm a tingle over you
(hey mister parson stand by,
Cause we've got a feelin' he's fallin'...)
I'm a fallin' for nobody else but you!
(nobody else will do,
But you...)
