Lyrics:


Everybody is lookin' for an answer, 
Now that you've tried your way,  
Why don't you try my way?  

Everybody is lookin' for a sunrise,  
Peace of mind, 
Is surely hard to find!  

Why don't you think it over,  
Before you step into oblivity? 
Why don't you think it over,  
Before you play your game with destiny? 

Everybody is lookin' for an answer, 
Now that you've tried your way,  
Why don't you try my way?  

Everybody is lookin' for a sunrise,  
Peace of mind, 
Is surely hard to find!  

We'll always walk together,  
In every kind of weather, 
If you will only take my hand!  

The joy of understanding,  
Is ours without an ending,  
Someday we'll find the promise land! 

Everybody is lookin' for an answer, 
Now that you've tried your way,  
Why don't you try my way?  

Everybody is lookin' for the sunrise,  
Peace of mind, 
Is surely hard to find! (Hard to find!) 

I hear the church bells ringin'  
And now the songs they're singin' 
I know you soon will take a stand...  

The joy is in forgiving,  
And all the while you're living,  
You'll only find it's in the plan! 

For the world is in His hand!   
(In His hand! In His hand!) 

Everybody is lookin' for an answer, 
Now that you've tried your way,  
Why don't you try my way?  

Everybody is lookin' for the sunrise,  
Peace of mind, 
Is surely hard to find!  

Everybody is lookin' for an answer, 
(Now) that you've tried your way,  
Why don't you try my way?  

Everybody is lookin' for the sunrise...
