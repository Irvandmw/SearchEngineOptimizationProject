Lyrics:


You're nearer, than my head is to my pillow, 
Nearer, than the wind is to the willow. 
Dearer, than the rain is to the earth below, 
Precious as the sun to the things that grow. 
You're nearer, than the ivy to the wall is, 
Nearer, than the winter to the fall is. 
Leave me, but when you're away, you'll know, 
You're nearer, for I love you so!
