Lyrics:


I don't need no coffee
I just need a quick smooch, baby, from you
To wake me up in the mornings
I just need a quick mmm, baby, from you

Yawning 'cause we stayed up all night
Ain't got time to be tired
Make me rise and shine

Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Oh, I need some of your sweet lovin'
Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Oh, I need some of your sweet lovin'

To come wake me up
I've been dreamin' of you
To come wake me up
Say you want me too

Help me forget my nightmares
I wanna make a real dream come true with you
Bring on that sunshine
Gotta get up real soon, we got work to do

Yeah, we be yawning 'cause we stayed up all night
Ain't got time to be tired
Make me rise and shine

Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Oh, I need some of your sweet lovin'
Good mornin' (Good mornin')
Good mornin' (Good mornin')
Oh, I need some of your sweet lovin'

To come wake me up
I've been dreamin' of you
To come wake me up
Say you want me too
To come wake me up
I've been dreamin' of you
To come wake me up
Say you want me too

I've been dreamin', oh I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin', I want you to wake me up
I've been dreamin', oh I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin', I want you to wake me up

Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Oh, I need some of your sweet lovin'
Good mornin' (Good mornin')
Good mornin' (Say good mornin')
Oh, I need some of your sweet lovin'

To come wake me up
I've been dreamin' of you
To come wake me up
Say you want me too
To come wake me up
I've been dreamin', oh I've been dreamin'
To come wake me up
Say you want me too
To come wake me up
