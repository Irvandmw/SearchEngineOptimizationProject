Lyrics:


Selfish people, girl
They always end up alone
How you supposed to eat, get all that you need
Then leave your homies just the bones?

I said selfish people, girl
Can never keep them by your side
The type to hang you out to dry
And I'm never tryna be that guy

So all I'm tryna say
If you coming to place
I put all for my city
All my buddies with me
Really gotta question this

Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want a bad girl, just like you, you
Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want a bad girl, just like you, you

I'm an honest guy, I've never been one to lie
Try to ever sugarcoat my lines
I'm giving you the truth girl, all the time

So all I'm tryna say
If you coming to place
I put all for my city
All my buddies with me
Really gotta question this

Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want a bad girl, just like you, you
Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want a bad girl, just like you, you

Do you got friends, yeah, friends?
'Cause I can't keep 'em waiting, oh
I'm losing all my patience, oh
Do you got friends?

Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want a bad girl, just like you, you
Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want a bad girl, just like you, you
Do you got friends?
