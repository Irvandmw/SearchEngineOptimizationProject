Lyrics:


You look so beautiful today
When you're sitting there
It's hard for me to look away
So I try to find the words that I could say
I know distance doesn't matter
But you feel so far away

And I can't lie
But every time I leave my heart turns gray
And I
I wanna come back home to see your face
Tonight 'cause I just can't take it

Another day without you with me
Is like a blade that cuts right through me
But I can wait
I can wait forever

When you call, my heart stops beating
When you're gone, it won't stop bleeding
But I can wait
I can wait forever

You look so beautiful today
It's like every time I turn around
I see your face
The thing I miss the most is waking up next to you
When I look into your eyes
Man, I wish that I could stay

And I can't lie
But every time I leave my heart turns gray
And I
Wanna come back home to see your face
Tonight 'cause I just can't take it

Another day without you with me
Is like a blade that cuts right through me
But I can wait
I can wait forever
I can wait forever

When you call, my heart stops beating
When you're gone, it won't stop bleeding
But I can wait
I can wait
I can wait
I can wait
I can wait forever

I know it feels like forever
I guess that's just the price I gotta pay
But when I come back home to feel your touch
Makes it better
Until that day
There's nothing else that I can do
And I just can't take it
I just can't take it

Another day without you with me
Is like a blade that cuts right through me
But I can wait
But I can wait
I can wait forever
I can wait forever

When you call, my heart stops beating
When you're gone, it won't stop bleeding
But I can wait
I can wait
I can wait
I can wait
I can wait forever

I can wait forever
I can wait forever
I can wait forever
I can hold for the day
'Cause you're gonna come back to me now
I can wait forever
I can wait forever
I can wait forever
