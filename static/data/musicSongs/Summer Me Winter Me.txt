Lyrics:


Summer me, winter me
And with your kisses, morning me, evening me
And as the world slips far away, a star away
Forever me with love

Wonder me, wander me
Then by a fire pleasure me, peaceful me
And in the silence quietly, whisper me
Forever me with love

And ev'ry day I'll gentle you, tender you
And oh, the way I'll velvet you, clover you
I'll wrap you up and ribbon you, rainbow you
And shower you   with shine!

Suddenly, magically, we found each other
There we were, here we are
I plan to let you happy me, summer me, winter me, always

[instrumental]

Then suddenly, magically, we found each other
There we were, here we are
I plan to let you happy me, summer me, winter me, always be mine
