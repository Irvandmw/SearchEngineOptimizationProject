Lyrics:


Tell me what you want from me
And I will do my best to please
Pleasing's all I ever do
Cuz they all expect me to
And everybody thinks I'm strong
But they don't know what's going on
They don't know what's on my mind
I fall behind...

Tell me to be what they want me to be
Everybody thinks that it's so easy
Sometimes it seems like there's two sides to me
Everybody thinks it's so easy being me

Tell me what you want to know
And I will do my best to show
Everything you ever need
Don't be concerned with me
Cuz everybody thinks I'm fine
But they don't even to take the time 
To find out who I really am
They don't understand

Tell me to be what they want me to be
Everybody thinks that it's so easy
Sometimes it seems like there's two sides to me
Everybody thinks it's so easy being me

Well tell me what to be
And don't pretend to care when you're not even there
Think that it's so easy

Tell me to be what they want me to be
Everybody thinks that it's so easy
Sometimes it seems like there's two sides to me
Everybody thinks that it's so easy
Tell me to be
Everybody thinks that it's so easy
Sometimes it seems
Everybody thinks that it's so easy being me
