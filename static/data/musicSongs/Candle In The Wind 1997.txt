Lyrics:


Goodbye England's Rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
You called out to our country 
And you whispered to those in pain 
Now you belong to heaven 
And the stars spell out your name

[Chorus:]
And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile  
This torch will always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you've brought us through the years 

[Chorus]

Goodbye England's Rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
Goodbye England's Rose 
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know

[Chorus]

And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will
