Lyrics:


No sleep at all, runnin' a lie
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time
That's a (that's a), that's a double negative, oh
Showing up late, dragging along
Won't pick up the phone while I be gone
Can't deny it
It's a double negative
Oh, double negative

Another jet, another day in the sky
Fly in another direction from you
Wish I could fedex my heart
And show up to your door
Signed, sealed, delivered
But I make you cry, let you down
More than likely from across town
Double shame on me
Double shame, oh

No sleep at all, runnin' a lie
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time
That's a (that's a), that's a double negative, oh
Showing up late, dragging along
Won't pick up the phone while I be gone
Can't deny it
It's a double negative
Oh, double negative

She's like, "he ain't got no boundaries
And he ain't got no patience"
She's like, "he never got nothing planned
So he'll never get anxious"
Look in your mind
Keep wondering if you're too high maintenance
Look in your mind
Keep wondering if I'm just too famous (uh)
Tryna shake the negative energy
I'm with the karma coming right back on me
In a moment I'm flying
Metaphorically, it seems like heaven

No sleep at all, runnin' a lie (runnin' a lie)
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time (guess time is up)
That's a (that's a), that's a double negative, oh
Showing up late, dragging along (dragging along)
Won't pick up the phone while I be gone
Can't deny it (I won't deny it)
It's a double negative (double negative)

Oh, yeah yeah
Oh... double negative (double negative)
Never miss the negativity
Oh no, no
Oh, woah... yeah...
