Lyrics:


Hey, Mr. Cage Man, let me get a fresh breath
Cherry bomb head strong I could fake my own death
Hey, Mr. Fate Man, shuffle me a ninth life
I've been wrong, go long
Throwing me a sharp right
It's not a picture perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

[Chorus:]
I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race and I'm hoping just to place
Oh I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

Hey, Mr. Safe Man, hustle me an okay
I could slide take a dive take it for the home team
Hey, Mr. Postman, slip me one more green note
I've been low hit the floor looking just to make broke
It's not a picture perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race and I'm hoping just to place
Oh I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

Hey, Mr.
Hey, hey Mr.
Hey, Mr. Cage Man
Cherry bomb
Let me get
Ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb

I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race and I'm hoping just to place
Oh I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus
