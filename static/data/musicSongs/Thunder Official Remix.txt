Lyrics:


Thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder
Thunder

[Dan Reynolds:]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Dan Reynolds:]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder (thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Dan Reynolds:]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder (thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder

[K.Flay:]
Broke down on the lonely highway
So loud are the screams in my brain
Oh, how I believed in my pain like it was my god
Looked back and I saw the dark clouds
Took that and I made my mom proud
It's easy to jump when you know how to fall (and lately I fall a lot)
Don't wanna sit around and wait, just hanging on a fantasy
I'm tryna be the kind of person who creates an energy
I hope I got the storm inside to maybe make a better me
Some people chalk it up to fate, I don't believe in destiny
I guess I had a spark inside I couldn't light when I was younger
Often times, I think you really need to fight to find the hunger
Lightning gets the shine, but I, I've been working on the thunder

Thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Dan Reynolds:]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder (thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
