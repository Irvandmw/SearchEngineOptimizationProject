Lyrics:


Married into this family and I'm datin' a bunch of outlaws
Even the children drawing guns out of little crayon box
Playing with scissors, cuttin' straight to the point
Don't need to beat around the bush we takin' shots to the groin

Take what I want, take what I need, and do it all with dignity
Say what I want, say what I need
And I don't need you to agree

I don't spit before I fuck it gotta
Got a hand on my pistol in my pocket
I don't play nice, I'm not a shit talker
I'm a straight shooter now just give me the money honey
Straight shooter now just give me the money honey
Straight shooter now just give me the money
Got a hand on my pistol in my pocket
I'm a straight shooter and just give me the money honey

I ain't kissin' no ass but I'm makin' out like a bandit
I'm brutally honest when I'm mouthin' off here's a bandage
They say I'm savvy for my age and savage as any devil
But at least I'm no imposter strapped in Jesus sandals

Take what I want, take what I need, and do it all with dignity
Say what I want, say what I need
And I don't need you to agree

I don't spit before I fuck it gotta
Got a hand on my pistol in my pocket
I don't play nice, I'm not a shit talker
I'm a straight shooter now just give me the money honey
Straight shooter now just give me the money honey
Straight shooter now just give me the money
Got a hand on my pistol in my pocket
I'm a straight shooter and just give me the money honey

Dear all the beauty with the lonely frames
Who whispers every word you want to hear
Evil is either underneath our graves
And poison all the flowers in her hair

I don't spit before I fuck it gotta
Got a hand on my pistol in my pocket
I don't play nice, I'm not a shit talker
I'm a straight shooter now just give me the money honey
Straight shooter now just give me the money honey
Straight shooter now just give me the money honey
Got a hand on my pistol in my pocket
I'm a straight shooter and just give me the money honey
