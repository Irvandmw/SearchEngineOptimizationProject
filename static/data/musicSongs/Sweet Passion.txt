Lyrics:


There comes a time, in every woman's life
When she meets that special someone
Ooh...
And he makes her feel... like a woman
Ow!
And if you awake all of the fire
Sweet passion. Yeah...
And I wanna say...

I need you so bad tonight, ooh, baby
I want you so bad tonight, ooh, darlin
I need you so bad tonight, yeah, baby, to
Hold me, yeah!
I need you so bad tonight, ooh, baby
I want you so bad tonight, ooh, darlin
I need you so bad tonight, hey, baby, now
Hold me, yeah, yeah!

In the mornin', baby, when I rise
If I can look into your pretty brown eyes
Hold me close, darlin', hold me tight
Love me good with all your passion and your might

I need you so bad tonight, ooh, baby
I want you so bad tonight, hey, darlin
I need you so bad tonight, yeah, baby, to
Hold me, ooh...

Wanna feel your lovin' hot on me
Kissin' me all over so tenderly, yeah
Hold me close and let your passion rise
I'm your woman, baby, through the lows and the highs

I need you so bad tonight, baby
I need you so bad tonight, ooh, darlin
I need you so bad tonight, yeah, baby
Hold me, yeah...

Darlin'... I love you. I love you
With me, you're free to be
A love that's... understanding, and never demanding
Feel the fires, feel the fires. Come on!

I wanna taste your lovin', baby, please
Brings me right on down to my knees
Do it good, baby, do it sweet
You're my soulmate, and I sho' am your

I need you so bad tonight, hey, baby
I want you so bad tonight, oh, darlin
I need you so bad tonight, yeah, baby, to
Hold me, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sweet passion... passion... sweet passion, hey
Passion... mmm... passion, yeah
Sweet passion... passion... passion, ooh...
Passion... passion... passion, hey-yeah-hey...
Sweet passion... passion... ooh...
Sweet passion... mm, passion... hey, yeah, yeah
Oh, passion... passion... passion...
