Lyrics:


We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way.

I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll stay with you one year.

We can sing in the sunshine
Oh, we'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way.

I'll sing to you each morning
And kiss you every night
But darling don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight.

And we can sing in the sunshine
Yeah, we'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way.

My daddy he once told me
Love can kill a man
Just take what woman give you
And give just what you can.

And you can sing in the sunshine
You'll laugh every day
You'll sing in the sunshine
And be on your way.

And when our year has ended
And I have gone away
You'll often speak about me
And this is what you'll say.

We sang in the sunshine
You know we laughed every day
We sang in the sunshine
Since he went away...
