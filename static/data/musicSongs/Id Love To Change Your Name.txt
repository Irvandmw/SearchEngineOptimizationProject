Lyrics:


Honey I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever want to change
Honey I'd sure love to change your name 

Do you believe in
Love a first site
I don't think that I did
Not until tonight
I saw you dancin'
On that hardwood floor
Kickin' your heels up
I knew it was love forevermore 

Honey I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever want to change
Honey I'd sure love to change your name 

You're probably thinkin'
I'm some kind of fool
Well you're right darlin'
I'm a fool for you
You'll buy this line babe
I'll buy you a ring
Get on my knees and
Beg you please to marry me 

Honey I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever want to change
Honey I'd sure love to change your name 

Honey I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever want to change
Honey I'd sure love to change your name
Yeah, Honey I'd sure love to change your name
