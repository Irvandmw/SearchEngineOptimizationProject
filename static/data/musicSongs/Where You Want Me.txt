Lyrics:


Whoa baby
(yeah uhu check it out)

Whoa baby
(yeah yeah yeah)

Gotta make a little room for me to breathe
Gotta feeling that your about to pull me in too deep
The more I try to walk away
(ooh yeah)
The harder it gets to believe that I don't need you
Ooh no

You've got a hold on me
(there's no escaping baby)
Got to find a release
Oh

[Chorus:]

Why do I feel so weak
When you are near me
You've got me in too deep
So help me baby

Your living in my dreams
Your always with me

Your the dark in my light
Your the black in my white
And I'll always know
You got me where you want me
(oh baby)
You got me where you want me
(oh baby)

You got me tempted by what's forbidden
(ooh yeah)
How can you be so sweet but ooh so unforgiving
And I'm emotionally drained
Am I too gone to be saved?
But I don't want it... any other way

You've got a hold on me
(there's no escaping baby)
Got to find a release
Oh

[Chorus:]

Why do I feel so weak
When you are near me
You've got me in too deep
So help me baby

Your living in my dreams
Your always with me

Your the dark in my light
Your the bright in my light
And I'll always know
You got me where you want me
(You got me where you want me)

You pull me close
I can't let go
My hands are tied
Your all that I know

You pull me close
I can't let go
My hands are tied
Your all that I know
(Your all that I know)

[Chorus: (Until fade out)]

Why do I feel so weak
When you are near me
You've got me in too deep
So help me baby

Your living in my dreams
(Your living in my dreams)
Your always with me

Your the dark in my light
Your the bright in my light
And I'll always know
You got me where you want me
