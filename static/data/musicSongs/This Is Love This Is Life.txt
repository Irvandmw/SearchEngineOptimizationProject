Lyrics:


These days whatâs left of me ainât no Prince Charming
And my Cinderella feels like she stayed at the dance too long
We ainât got much but what we got is all that matters
Weâre pickinâ up the pieces, tryinâ to put âem back where they belong

Ohh, itâs gonna be alright
This is love, this is life
When times get tough weâre still worth the fight
This is love, this is life
The road hereâs paved with the brokenhearted
We gotta finish what we started
Ohhh, better hold on tight
This is love, this is life

These days it seems like thereâs three sides to every story
Thereâs yours, mine, lately thereâs the cold hard truth
Who cares whoâs wrong or right when we turn out the lights?
Weâll find forgiveness when weâre in each otherâs arms tonight
It ainât pretty but somehow we always make it through

Ohh, itâs gonna be alright
This is love, this is life
When times get tough weâre still worth the fight
This is love, this is life
The road hereâs paved with the brokenhearted
We gotta finish what we started
Ohhh, better hold on tight
This is love, this is life

Ohh, itâs gonna be alright
This is love, this is life
When times get tough weâre still worth the fight
This is love, this is life
The road hereâs paved with the brokenhearted
We gotta finish what we started
Ohhh, better hold on tight
This is love, this is life
This is love, this is life
This is love, this is life
