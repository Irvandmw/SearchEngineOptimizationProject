Lyrics:


Love is the sweetest thing
What else on earth could ever bring
Such happiness to everything
As love's old story

Love is the strangest thing
No song of birds upon the wing
Shall in our hearts so sweetly sing
That love's old story

Whatever heart may desire
Whatever fate may send
This is the song that never will tire
This is the song without end

Love is the greatest thing
The oldest, yet the latest thing
I only hope that fate may bring
Love's story to you

Whatever heart may desire
Whatever fate may send

Love is the sweetest thing
Love is the greatest thing
Love is the greatest thing
This is the song that never will tire
This is the song without end

Love is the greatest thing
The oldest, yet the latest thing
I only hope that fate may bring
Love's story to you
