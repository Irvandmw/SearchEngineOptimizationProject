Lyrics:


South of the border, down Mexico way, 
That's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play, 
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray, 
South of the border, down Mexico way! 

She was a picture in ol' Spanish lace, 
Just for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face, 
For it was "Fiesta" and we were so gay, 
South of the border, down Mexico way! 

Then she sighed as she whispered "MaÃ±ana" 
Never dreamin' that we were partin', 

And I lied as I whispered "MaÃ±ana" 
For our tomorrow never came! 

South of the border, I rode back one day, 
There in a veil of white by candle-light she knelt to pray, 
The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay, 
South of the border, down Mexico way! 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!... Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
