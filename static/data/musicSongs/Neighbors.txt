Lyrics:


[Cee-Lo]
Now my neighbor likes where I stay
But doesn't, know, the price that I pay
My neighbor!! My neighbor!!
Myyyyy neighbor... wants what he sees
My neighbor!! My neighbor!!
Myyyyy neighbor... thinks he wants to be me
But he'll never be

From out my window, seems just fine
But in his mind, again his world is far from kind
So I invited him over, could this make a new friend
But once I got to know ya, wish I never let you in

Now my neighbor likes my clothes
But hadn't seen me with my scars exposed
My neighbor!! My neighbor!!
Myyyyy neighbor, ohhh dissatisfied
My neighbor!!
My neighbor's, behavior... is unjustified
I'm sick and tired

I don't know, if he lives all alone
But if you're scared of the darkness best leave the lights on
I had a talk with my neighbor
Say it simple and plain
I guess, he understood me
He never came back again

Now my neighbor, likes my car
But no matter where you go, there you are...
