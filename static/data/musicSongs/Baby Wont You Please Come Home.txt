Lyrics:


Baby won't you please come home
'Cause you're daddy's all alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name

When you left you broke my heart
'Cause I thought we'd never part
Well every hour in the day
You can here me say
Baby won't you please come home, mmm
Baby won't you please come home

Baby won't you please come home
'Cause you're daddy's all alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name

When you left you broke my heart
'Cause I thought we'd never part
Well every hour in the day
You can here me say
Baby won't you please come home, mmm
Baby won't you please come home

When you left you broke my heart
'Cause I thought we'd never part
Well every hour in the day
You can here me say
Baby won't you please come home, mmm
Baby won't you please come home
