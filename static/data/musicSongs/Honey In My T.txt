Lyrics:


You know I like a lot of honey in my tea
Honey in my tea, sticky but it's sweet
You know I like a lot of honey in my tea...
You know I like a lot of honey in my tea (you know I like it...)
Honey in my tea, sticky but it's sweet (you know I like it...)
You know I like a lot of honey in my tea (you know I like it...)

You gon' be my mocha choca latte with the steam
Risin' to the top you bout ya cream
Taste it in the morning, in they dreams
I bring home the bacon, egg and cheese
He put that Hitachi on the bean
Straw up in my coffee 'cause my teeth white
Bright and early doesn't always mean bright
Arrive fashionably late and we fine

Top of morning that's when he lick me up
I mean it's 8 AM, need a pick me up
Been a boss got an assistant to get me one
When I floss don't need a pick bitch slip me gum
Spit fresh, no act two, got a minty tongue
Why when you hit the stage they all get refunds?
Snooze you lose honey bunny here she come

He put the creamer-creamer in that mocha-mocha
Said that chocha-chocha taste like mimosa-mosa
He put the creamer-creamer in that mocha-mocha
Said that chocha-chocha taste like mimosa-mosa

You know I like a lot of honey in my tea (you know I like it boy)
Honey in my tea, sticky but it's sweet
You know I like a lot of honey in my tea (honey in my tea)...
You know I like a lot of honey in my tea (you know I like it...)
Honey in my tea, sticky but it's sweet (you know I like it...)
You know I like a lot of honey in my tea (you know I like it...)

You know I like it, I like it, I like it
You know I like it, I like it, I like it
Ya he put the creamer-creamer in that mocha-mocha
Said that chocha-chocha taste like mimosa-mosa
He put the creamer-creamer in that mocha-mocha
Said that chocha-chocha taste like mimosa-mosa
