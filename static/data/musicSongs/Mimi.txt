Lyrics:


Mimi
You funny good for nothing Mimi
Am I the guy for Mimi
You little honey of a Mimi
I'm aiming high
Mimi you got me sad and dreamy
You could free me if you'd see me Mimi
You know I'd like to have a little of some Mimi by and by

Oh Mimi you got me sad and dreamy
You could free me if you'd see me Mimi
You know I'd like to have a little some
Of Mimi
By and by
By and by
