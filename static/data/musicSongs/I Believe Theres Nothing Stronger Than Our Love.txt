Lyrics:


I believe there's nothing stronger than our love
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love

When I'm with you, baby
All my worries disappear
Troubles that surround me
Disappear when you are near
When you need my loving, I'll be there, you know
When you need my loving, you know where to go

I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (I believe it)
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (I do believe it)
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (baby, I believe it)

When I'm full of sadness
Nice to know you're always there
In this world of madness
Nice to know somebody cares
When I need your loving, you'll be there, I know
When I need your loving, I'll know where to go

I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (I believe it)
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (I do believe it)
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (baby, I believe it)

When I'm with you, baby
Ooh, you make me feel so good
When I'm with you, baby
You give me what nobody could
When you need my loving, I'll be there, you know (you know)
When you need my loving, you know where to go (to go)

I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (I believe it)
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (I do believe it)
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (baby, I believe it)
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (really believe it)
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love (baby, I believe it)
I believe there's nothing stronger than our love
