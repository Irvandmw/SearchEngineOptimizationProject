Artist: Richard Marx Lyrics
Song Name: Burning Of The Heart
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


One after one they give into the urge
Caught by some hand of desire.
Held by the feelings that brings them together.
It's all a mystery. When will they learn.
It's just emotion on fire.
That soul taking, primitive, passion of nature.

[Chorus:]
I try to run. I try to never fall apart.
But love takes pleasure from
The Burning of the Heart
Burning of the Heart.

Telling myself I should run while there's time
I see that look in her eyes
She's turning the heat of the moment up higher.
And watching for questions I have in my mind.
She knows somewhere in our lives
It's only love that can find us an answer.

[Chorus]

Telling myself I should run while there's time
I see that look in her eyes
She's turning the heat of the moment up higher
And watching for questions I have in my mind
She knows somewhere in our lives
It's only love that can find us an answer.

[Chorus]
