Lyrics:


Welcome, to some shit that's considered legendary
I'm here to put the rap game in the cemetery
They told me it couldn't happen
Ain't no way in hell you gon' make millions off of rapping
But I'm just so determined
Catch me on the stage spitting verses like a sermon
You know I had to make them realize
Lights, camera, action, mawfucka check the real in my eyes
Now they all looking so surprised
The dawn of a new era, like the sun had arise
Through these lyrics, I am immortalized
Strictly spiting the truth but the rest is telling more lies
This the type of shit most people fantasize
But this the shit I used to analyze
They told me I was too underground
So I took the mic out my basement and found another sound
I want it, I need it, I'm coming for the crown
Can't nobody stop me, I'm Rocky let's go another round

[Hook: Kanye West from "Can't Tell Me Nothing"]

I'm kinda on my Rockafella meets Nelson Mandela
Raining money, no umbrella flow
Most of these people they will never know
Watchu have to sacrifice as a person to truly grow
See I'm in love with this shorty right
But first I gotta get this story right
Cause in this business love will never last
Sold out shows, hoes, and a whole lotta ass
Damn what a concoction
But these hoes ain't an option
Cause a woman what I'm looking for
A girl with wisdom that give me brain so insane
Or maybe I'm just going insane
On the road to success, so I'm living in the fast lane
