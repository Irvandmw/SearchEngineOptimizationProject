Lyrics:


I've been wondering what to wear
I love our noon rendezvous
I know you tell me you missed me
And I want to make love to you

Your words they intoxicate me
I shiver each time that you speak
How much more can I endure, my love?
The sound of your voice makes me weak

If my body functions operate
This way when you just call my name
I'd hate to see when we are finally
Playing that nasty love game

Your words they intoxicate me
I shiver each time that you speak
How much more can I endure, my love?
The sound of your voice makes me weak

The words are all over your face, my love
What shall you or shall I do?
You could show me some new tricks, my love
I'd love to be taught by you

I've been wondering what to wear
I love our noon rendezvous
