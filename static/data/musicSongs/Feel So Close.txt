Lyrics:


I feel so close to you right now, it's a force-field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like it's a big deal
Your love comes down on me, surrounds me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

I feel so close to you right now, it's a force-field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like it's a big deal
Your love comes down on me, surrounds me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

And I never knew I would feel what I feel when I'm with you
I never knew I would feel what I feel when I'm with you, when I'm with you
No, come close, hold me now, hold me now
Oh, come close and hold me now, hold me now

'Cause there's no stopping us right now, oh oh
I feel so close to you right now
I feel so close to you right now, a force-field
There's no stopping us right now

I never knew I would feel what I feel when I'm with you
