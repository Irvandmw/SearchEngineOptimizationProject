Lyrics:


Look into my eyes deeper, deeper
Can't you feel yourself getting drowsier, drowsier

Sleep, when you wake up
You will make to love to the very first person you see
When I snap my fingers, you will wake up
And the first one you'll see is me

You're gonna make love to me
I can't resist, I'll say no
You'll say I insist
Then I'll give in, for what more can I do
You're gonna make love to me
Tender love, just like I've been dreaming of
Open your eyes at the count of three
And make love to me

Listen to my voice softer, softer
Floating on a cloud getting drowsier, drowsier

Sleep, when you wake up
You will make to love to the very first person you see
When I snap my fingers, you will wake up
And the first one you'll see will be me

You're gonna make love to me
I'll resist, I'll say no
You'll say I insist
Then I'll give in, for what more could I do
You're gonna make love to me
Tender love, just like I've been dreaming of
Open your eyes at the count of three
And make love to me

One, two, three

Love to me, love to me
Baby
Love to me, love to me
Baby
Love to me, love to me
Baby
Love to me, love to me
Baby
Love to me, love to me
Baby
