Lyrics:


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself ?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I bet, I bet you wish you had days
'Cause carrying this weight will break your glass knees, yeah
Don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half speed

Get the fuck out of my car, this ain't a taxi
They love to see me lonely, hate to see me happy
Call me what you want, she call me Daddy
Got a knack for getting nasty everyday, we keep a tally, yeah
Oh, it's true, I want it badly
Hit the zoom, I be moving like a athlete
(Now concentrate) No reason to be that upset
I'm busy tripping 'bout some shit that still ain't even happen yet
I keep it honest as honesty gets
Don't now why I'm always talking if I'm not making sense
I spent my life living with a lot of regrets
You throw me off my high horse, I'll probably fall to my death

(Bad behaviour) It's obvious you're not on your best
I might just pull your card if it's on top of the deck
Gimme, gimme what I need and then I'm onto the next
That's what we calling 'Cause and Effect'

Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself ?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I bet, I bet you wish you had days
'Cause carrying this weight will break your glass knees, yeah
Don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half speed

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
