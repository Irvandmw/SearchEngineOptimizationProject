Lyrics:


I donât want nobody fuckinâ with me in these streets, children
I donât want nobody fuckinâ with me in these streets, uh-uh
I donât want nobody fuckinâ with me in these streets, cause
Ainât nobody got time for that
Ainât nobody got time for that
Ainât nobody got, Ainât nobody got
Ainât nobody got time for that

Real shit mane, no matter where you from
The same rules and regulations apply, the G code

I donât hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, Iâm affiliated
See Iâm real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, Iâm affiliated
Grew up from the turf, love doinâ work, Iâm affiliated
See I donât hang in my hood but I bang in my hood

All I bang is that crip shit, trip this
Big Snoop Dogg with my cousin Trick Trick
Put the hammer to your bisquick to your biscuit
Jam with the jelly sellinâ grams at the telly
On the telly with the plinug
If you really want it come and get it on the Dinnub
20 gang, for life, all my niggas locked down
Know I got emâ right
Its a new game, Its a new day
We even got homies in Akron and OK-C
And I'm the [?] Go and see em'
Holla at a nigga on the DM
All I know is to bang the beach, (long beach)
40 years nigga, banginâ the east
And I canât stop and I wonât stop
Even though I got a grill, still 20 crip nigga

I donât hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, Iâm affiliated
See Iâm real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, Iâm affiliated
Grew up from the turf, love doinâ work, Iâm affiliated
See I donât hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, Iâm affiliated

Shit
Pull up, get out, hood up, sit down
No need to stand, he is the man
It is I, he, King, NFZ, so my thrown, a no fly zone
To make sure they mail theyâre check, fly down LAX
To see my big cuz, fuck yâall thought this shit was
Turn a couple corners, big homiesâll pull up on ya
What we finnaâ do what the move is
Cuz say the money where the booth is
Go and show the motherfuckers where the truth is
Hold up cuz I do this, state to state face to face
Straight up G shit, 7 mile nigga with the 21 east clique
Love my neighbors, season floor seats Pistons and Lakers

I donât hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, Iâm affiliated
See Iâm real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, Iâm affiliated
Grew up from the turf, love doinâ work, Iâm affiliated
See I donât hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, Iâm affiliated

State to State, Oh

I donât hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, Iâm affiliated
See Iâm real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, Iâm affiliated
Grew up from the turf, love doinâ work, Iâm affiliated
See I donât hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, Iâm affiliated
