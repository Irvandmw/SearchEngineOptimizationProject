Lyrics:


I don't need me sophistication
What I need me is a vacation
I said I don't need no sophistication
What I need me is a vacation from myself
Is a vacation from my life
No sophistication
O, no, no, no, no saturation
Keep the peace I don't need no confrontation
I got tequila in my hand this is a celebration
Dying on the cross for your salvation
Feeling like a Star constellation
I said I don't need no sophistication
What I need me is a vacation from myself
Is a vacation from my life
No sophistication
