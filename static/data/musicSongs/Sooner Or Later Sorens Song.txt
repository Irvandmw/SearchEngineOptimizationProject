Lyrics:


Come back and haunt me,
Follow me home,
Give me a motive,
Swallow me whole.

They say I've lost it.
What could I know?
And I'm not a mockery.
I'm so alone.

Sooner or later you'll find out
There's a hole in the wall.
Yeah, sooner or later you'll find out
There's a hole in the wall.

Today is ours.
Condemned to be free.
Free to keep breathing.
Free to believe.

I look to find you
Down on my knees.
Oh, God, I believe!
Please help me believe.

Sooner or later they'll find out
There's a hole in the wall.
Yeah, sooner or later you'll find out
That you'll dream to be that small.

I'm a believer, help me believe.
I'm a believer, help me believe.

I gave it all away,
I lost who I am.
I threw it all away
With everything to gain.

And I'm taking the leap
With dreams of shrinking,
Dreams of shrinking.
Dreams of shrinking.
Dreams of shrinking.

Come back and haunt me,
Follow me home,
Give me a motive,
Swallow me whole.

Sooner or later.
Sooner or later.
Sooner or later.
You'll find out.
Sooner or later.
You always follow me home.
Sooner or later.
Sooner or later.
