Lyrics:


[Lloyd + Chamillionaire]
It's time to make a movie, It's time to make a movie. Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Young Lloyd, Twista. Let's get it.
Girl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it,
Sit back like a player while you doin' what you doin',
Whisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me,
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie.
Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie,
Time to make a, oh yeah, it's time to make a movie.
Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie,
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie.

[Chamillionaire]
Let's get it.
You know what it is homegirl let's get it.
Your little boyfriend ain't ever know that we did it.
Gotta homegirl let me know if she with it,
Two girls, one bed let me know and we'll split it quit it.
Tell me how he gonna know, way too much bread no Keebler though.
When I see money I speed to the door,
If it ain't no doe I speed to the doe.
Where she gonna go, stick to the script get used to my plot,
Making it wet no use of a prop
I'll make you regret not using a mop.
Booze to your stock, you looking hot,
So I bet that we gonna Tom Cruise to the top,
I could turn the Rosay down to the south,
And I love how your mouth never losing the drop.
Ey, you could have it girl,
Not an amateur, I could manage ya,
Candy car looking bluer than an avatar,
I'll help you get your groove back like Angela.
I could handle her, show her I'm the best,
An Academy Award and the Oscars next,
And Trey Songz telling you that he invented sex,
I guess you can say that I invented checks.

[Chorus - Lloyd + Chamillionaire]
Girl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it,
Sit back like a player while you doin' what you doin',
Whisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me,
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie.
Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie,
Time to make a, oh yeah, it's time to make a movie.
Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie,
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie.

[Twista]
What's up little mama, come and meet me your manager,
Be your photographer, you be the one ima take a picture of,
You could be on my cinema, then ima get you whatever you want,
Then ima do anything to get your love,
Hit it from the back and hit it from the front,
And ima look in the camera so I could let em know it's up in it,
When I'm filmin', I'll be ready, next triple,
'Cause I circle their nipples and every movie you gon be up in it.
Pull me out and people be classy and but baby we can surprise me,
You can be my porn star, keep the lights on,
'Cause I wanna see it, it's better for shootin',
And how you be lookin' I see you goin' far,
I sleep over your kids, you'll be right back,
Openin' up your legs now you on the right track,
Let me aim the camera down while you wipe that,
We can forget about the lips, do you like that?
That, that. I'll be workin' your body like I be working the pictures in the portfolio,
I don't know if it was a face, it was a hair, it was an ass, that made me want to put you up in the video.
Give it to Twista with the Chamillionaire,
Murder in the booth when I smoke a fillionaire?
I'll be the director come gimme a chair,
Star quality I'll see you when I'm a trillionaire.

[Chorus - Lloyd + Chamillionaire]
Girl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it,
Sit back like a player while you doin' what you doin',
Whisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me,
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie.
Ain't no need to be nervous, we can get some room service,
I can give it how you want it girl if that's okay,
Time to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie.
Gotta tell me how you want it, you know ima be up on it from the night till the mornin' girl if that's okay.
Time to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie.
One, two, three, go. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Oh, she likes me, oh. Let's get it.
One, two, three, go. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Oh, she likes me, oh.
Let's make a movie.

[Chorus - Lloyd + Chamillionaire]
Girl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it,
Sit back like a player while you doin' what you doin',
Whisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me,
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie.
Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie,
Time to make a, oh yeah, it's time to make a movie.
Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie,
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie.
