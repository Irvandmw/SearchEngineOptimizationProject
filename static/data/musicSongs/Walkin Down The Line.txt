Lyrics:


Well I'm walkin' down the line
I'm walkin' down the line
I'm walkin' down the line
My feet'll be a flyin'
To tell about my troubled mind

I got a heavy headed gal
I got a heavy headed gal
I got a heavy headed gal
She ain't a feelin' well
When she's better only time will tell

Well I'm walkin' down the line
I'm walkin' down the line
I'm walkin' down the line
My feet'll be a flyin'
To tell about my troubled mind

My money comes an' goes
My money comes an' goes
My money comes an' goes
And rolls and flows, and rolls and flows
Through the holes in the pockets of my clothes

Well I'm walkin' down the line
I'm walkin' down the line
I'm walkin' down the line
My feet'll be a flyin'
To tell about my troubled mind

I see the morning light
I see the morning light
Well it's not because I'm an early riser
I didn't go to sleep last night

I got a heavy headed gal
I got a heavy headed gal
I got a heavy headed gal
She ain't a feelin' well
When she's better only time will tell

Well I'm walkin' down the line
I'm walkin' down the line
I'm walkin' down the line
My feet'll be a flyin'
To tell about my troubled mind
