Lyrics:


[VERSE 1]
You sent me up to heaven
I was safe and loved there
Then you pushed me down the ladder
Now you just left me here

[PRE-CHORUS]
But I'm strong, cant get hurt
This must be wrong, won't sink down in the dirt

[CHORUS]
What's with me
This is not happening
Not to me
Not reality
Not to me
Not to me

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]
