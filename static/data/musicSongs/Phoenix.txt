Lyrics:


Mother, just lay your head down
You've been burning both ends of the candle and you're done
It's time to find your wings again and turn your face towards the sun
Some battles can't be won

Like a phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix
Rising from the flame
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright again

Oh brother, your hands are tired
You've been holding the world up and you're losing your grip
If you knew now what you knew then, maybe you'd be whole again
But everyone falls down

Like a phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix
Rising from the flame
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright again

You built a castle in the clouds
But then the fire burned it down
You're still standing anyway
All you needed from the start
Was waiting there inside your heart
To be born again

Like a phoenix
Like a phoenix
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright again
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright again
