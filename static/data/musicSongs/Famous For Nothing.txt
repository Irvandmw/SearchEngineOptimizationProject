Lyrics:


I love my fame,
so letâs talk more about me..

I've got no shame,
my sex tape is coming out next week..

Iâm so crazy,
'Cause itâs good for the ratings,
so take another picture for US weekly,
calling my friends,
You can call âem paparazzi

Turn up the lights, cameras go,
Get out the way,
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..
Out every night,
My lifeâs a show,
Iâm getting paid,
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..
I canât act, canât dance, 
canât write, canât sing..
oh No, I canât do anything
Turn up the lights, 
I love the dough
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..

Oh oh ohoh
oh oh ohoh
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..

Good press, bad press,
it makes no difference to me..
if I go to the grocery store,
I make sure to call TMZ,
When I go out,
I get paid to party,
Iâm always on the list,
champagne, red carpet,
You fly coach,
I only fly private..

Turn up the lights, cameras go,
Get out the way,
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..
Out every night,
My lifeâs a show,
Iâm getting paid,
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..
I canât act, canât dance, 
canât write, canât sing..
oh No, I canât do anything
Turn up the lights, 
I love the dough
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..

Iâm dating someone famous,
it makes me even more famous, itâs true! (oh oh oh)
I can hear you people laughing,
canât you see the joke is really on you.. (oh oh oh)
Now you follow all my ups and downs,
Iâm filling up my bank account,
Iâm so big, Iâm so important,
You wanna be my friend,
just call my agent..

Say you only got fifteen minutes,
and mine are almost up,
I guess Iâll take the bus back home,
when my spin off flops..

Turn up the lights, cameras go,
Get out the way,
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..
Out every night,
My lifeâs a show,
Iâm getting paid,
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..
I canât act, canât dance, 
canât write, canât sing..
oh No, I canât do anything
Turn up the lights, 
I love the dough
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..

I got the life, too bad they know,
Get out the way,
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing
Out every night,
My lifeâs a show,
Iâm getting paid,
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..
canât act, canât dance, canât write, canât sing, oh
No, I canât do anything,
Turn up the lights, 
pile up the dough,
'Cause Iâm famous for nothing..
