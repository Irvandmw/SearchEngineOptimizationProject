Lyrics:


Papa told me to stay strong
To tighten up my bootstraps
Before I get walked on
Don't you give up (Ooh, yeah)

Now I'm rockin' Versace with my dog
In my shades, I'mma slay Rodeo y'all
I'mma fuck up a check and spend it all
Gonna have a tequila kinda day (Mhm)

'Cause the stranger you are
They wanna keep you locked in the dark
Said the stranger you are
They're gonna try to tear you apart

But I'm 6'3", baby, with boots on
If you think you can beat me, I'm nothin' to walk on
It's all in the strut (Yeah, yeah)

Now I'm rockin' Versace with my dog
In my shades, I'mma slay Rodeo y'all
I'mma fuck up a check and spend it all
Gonna have a tequila kinda day (Hey, woah)

'Cause the stranger you are (Ooh, yeah)
They wanna keep you locked in the dark (Ooh, oh)
Said the stranger you are
They're gonna try to tear you apart

'Cause the stranger you are
They wanna keep you locked in the dark
And the stranger you are
They're gonna try to tear you apart
The stranger you are
They wanna keep you locked in the dark
And the stranger you are
They're gonna try to tear you apart
