Lyrics:


Well I've been a little lazy, been a little crazy
On the road most of my life
Got me some stories, moments of glory
But it cost me the love of my life

Now I'm stuck in this small town, without a soul around
Who understands the things that I've done
It's to late for the game, so if it's all the same
Won't you send me somebody to love

Oh won't you send me somebody, send me somebody
Send me somebody to love
Oh won't you send me somebody, send me somebody
Send me somebody to love

I've been all 'round the world, and known so many girls
Had more than my share of good times
I'm quick with a whip, I just roll when I'm hit
Move on to friendlier clime's

And love when it leaves you, will burn you then freeze you
I shiver to think that she's gone
It's to late for the game, so if it's all the same
Won't you send me somebody to love

Oh won't you send me somebody, send me somebody
Send me somebody to love
Oh won't you send me somebody, send me somebody
Send me somebody to love

You can send in the clowns and all the girls in their gowns
They'd fill me for a night or two
When it gets this low and I'm scrapin' my soul
I need someone I can talk to

Oh so won't you send me somebody, send me somebody
Send me somebody to love
Oh won't you send me somebody, send me somebody
Send me somebody to love

Oh won't you send me somebody, send me somebody
Send me somebody to love
Oh won't you send me somebody, send me somebody
Send me somebody to love
