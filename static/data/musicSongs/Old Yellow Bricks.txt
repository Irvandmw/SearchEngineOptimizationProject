Lyrics:


Old yellow bricks,
Love's a risk,
Quite the little Escapologist
Looked so miffed,
When you wished,
For a thousand places better than this,

You are the fugitive,
But you don't know what you're running from,
You can't kid us,
And you couldn't trick anyone,
Houdini, love you don't know what you're running away from,

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

She was enraged by the way,
That the emperor put traps in the cage,
And the days she deemed dull,
Lead to nights reading beer bottles,

You're such a fugitive,
But you don't know what you're running from,
You can't kid us,
And you couldn't trick anyone,
Houdini, love you don't know what you're running away from,

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

You're at a loss,
Just because,
It wasn't all that you thought it was,

You are a fugitive but you don't know what you're running away from,

She said, "I want to sleep in a city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia."
I know I said, "Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?" but
Dorothy was right though
