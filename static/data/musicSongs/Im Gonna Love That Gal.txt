Lyrics:


I'm gonna love that gal like she's never been loved before 
I'm gonna show that gal she's the baby that I adore 
When she's in my arms again  
Our dreams will all come true  
Then, the years between might never have been  
We'll start our lives anew! 

I'm gonna kiss that gal like she's never been kissed before 
And though I miss that gal she's the baby I'm waitin' for 

We'll never part again  
She'll hold my heart again  
Forever and ever more  
I'm gonna love that gal like she's never been loved before!
