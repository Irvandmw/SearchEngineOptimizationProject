Lyrics:


If you're lonely, if you're blue
There are a lot of people in this world
who feel the way you do
Come to Juanita's place
Tiny tables, tiny chairs
The people go in one by one each night
and they come out in pairs
Down at Juanita's place

Love never can find you when you're alone
Leave your heartaches behind you, why be alone?

Though there's hardly room to dance
When you are squeezed together
Just a touch can lead you to romance
Down at Juanita's place
Every table has a view
A view of someone who's in search of love
The very same as you
Come to Juanita's place

Love never can find you when you're alone
Leave your heartaches behind you, why be alone?

So come along and you'll find love inside
True love cannot find those who hide
