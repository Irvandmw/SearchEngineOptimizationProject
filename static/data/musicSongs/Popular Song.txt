Lyrics:


[Both: MIKA and Ariana Grande]
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompoms
Now you're working at the movies selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
Cause I'm putting down my story in a popular song
Ahh, I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

[Both:]
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, cause my song is popular

[MIKA:]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

[Both:]
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

[Both:]
Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Pickin' on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes and in between them
Dunk me in the toilets now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughing, got everyone clapping, asking
How come you look so cool?
Cause that's the only thing that I learned at school, boy
Uh huh, I said that's the only thing that I learned at school

[Both:]
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, cause my song is popular

[MIKA:]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

[Both:]
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

[Ariana Grande:]
That's all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
That's all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
That's all you ever need to know

[Both:]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
