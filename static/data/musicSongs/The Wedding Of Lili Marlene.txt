Lyrics:


There were tears in the crowded congregation
There were hearts that had loved but all in vain
'Twas goodbye to the sweetheart of the nation
At the wedding of Lili Marlene

Men who'd marched where the desert sands are burning
From Tobruk down the road to Alamein
In their hearts were tender memories were returning
At the wedding of Lili Marlene

As she knelt where the candle lights were gleaming
It seemed the choir sang soft and low
Farewell, my angel of the lamplight
We'll always love you so

Down the aisle came the bride in all her glory
To the strains of her own sweet love refrain
'Twas the end of a very lovely story
At the wedding of Lili Marlene

Farewell, my angel of the lamplight
We'll always love you so

Down the aisle came the bride in all her glory
To the strains of her own sweet love refrain
'Twas the end of a very lovely story
At the wedding of Lili Marlene
