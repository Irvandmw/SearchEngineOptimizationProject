Lyrics:


Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasnât easy
But nothing is, no

When I feel heavy metal
And Iâm pins and Iâm needles
Well I lie and Iâm easy
All of the time but Iâm never sure when I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When I was young
Itâs not my problem
Itâs not my problem

When I feel heavy metal
And Iâm pins and Iâm needles
Well I lie and Iâm easy
All of the time but Iâm never sure when I need you
Pleased to meet you

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
