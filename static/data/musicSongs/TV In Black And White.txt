Lyrics:


If you get lonely, think of me only
Prison isnât going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we'd
Wade into the water âtil the waves turned blue

Nobody does have to know that our loveâs alive,
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
Got that same address, if you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue, wishing and thinkinâ of you

Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When Iâm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

If you get lonely, think of this only
Heaven hasnât forgotten about you
Though you canât hold me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex-girl, boo

I wonât tell a single soul how you spend your nights
In that single cell holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid then you ought to know
That youâre the one I want,
The one I want forevermore

Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When Iâm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

I know you get scared sometimes, boy
Nothing to be feared when youâre in my heart
Troubles come in threes, but in your case,
They came in millions, and trillions, but thatâs alright

Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When Iâm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

Like TV in black and white [4x]
