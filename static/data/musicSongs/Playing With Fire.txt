Lyrics:


Hey, you got the look of a lonely woman's eyes,
What'cha thinking when you're standing so close to me?
Ain't no law says a man can't fantasize,
There's a secret locked up in you tight
Ooh! I'd love to turn the key.
Whoah, playing with fire...fighting my desire, baby...
...my conscience is a liar.
Oh, lord, have mercy on the shameless sinner...!
...walking on a wire, now i...i face the crucifier,
What'cha doin' to me?
Live by rules made up by society,
But I guess I must have missed election day
'cause so much about you looks so good to me, yeah!
For what I'm thinking I could go to jail,
But some laws are born to break...
...stakes are getting higher, now i...
...i think I'm losin' it...
