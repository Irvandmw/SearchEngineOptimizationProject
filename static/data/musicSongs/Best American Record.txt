Lyrics:


My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the 'Houses of the Holy'
Smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had to the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

Whatever's on tonight
I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight
I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew
I wanted

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was seventies in spirit; nineties in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had to the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

Whatever's on tonight
I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight
I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew
I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu
And I want it

It's true
All the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true
All the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls
Love the way Bill plays guitar

Whatever's on tonight
I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight
I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew
I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu
And I want it

There's something that I never knew
I wanted
