Lyrics:


Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there

Come on, shake, like you know you got something to prove, little mama
Move, like the groove's taking over you, make no mistake
You're in the place to be by far, so let's get crazy
Like we ain't never gon' see tomorrow

Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there

Shake, like you know you got nothing to lose, make it move
Girl, you know what we came to do, make no mistake
You're in the place to be by far, so let's get crazy
Like we ain't never gon' see tomorrow

Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there

'Cause when the groove gets on, ooh it's on
And if you need some lead, take mine
'Cause when the groove gets on, ooh it's on
So let's have the night of our lives

Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there

'Cause when the groove gets on, ooh it's on
And if you need some lead, take mine
'Cause when the groove gets on, ooh it's on
So let's have the night of our lives

Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
Are you comfortable, right there right there
Let the groove get in, there there right there
