Lyrics:


[Laura Jane Grace:]
All dressed up and nowhere to go
Walking the streets all alone
Another night to wish that you could forget
Making yourself up as you go along

[Both:]
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?

[Laura Jane Grace:]
Does god bless your transsexual heart
True Trans Soul Rebel

Yet to be born, you're already dead
You sleep with a gun beside you in bed
You follow it through to the obvious ends
Slit your veins wide open
You bleed it out

[Both:]
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?

[Laura Jane Grace:]
Does god bless your transsexual heart
True Trans Soul Rebel

Well you should've been a mother
You should've been a wife
You should've been gone from here years ago
You should be living a different life

[Both:]
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?

[Laura Jane Grace:]
Does god bless your transsexual heart
True Trans Soul Rebel
True Trans Soul Rebel!
