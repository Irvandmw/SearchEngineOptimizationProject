Lyrics:


Lets make this hot

I'm mister green Christmas, I'm mister sun
I'm mister heat blister, I'm mister 101

I never wanna see a day under 60 degrees
I'd rather have it 80 or 100 degrees

He's mister green Christmas, he's mister sun
He's mister heat blister, he's mister 101
He's mister green Christmas, he's mister sun 
Bum-ba-bum
He's mister heat blister, he's mister 101

I never wanna see a day under 60 degrees
I'd rather have it 80 or 100 degrees
I never wanna see a day under 60 degrees 
I'd rather have it 80 or 100 degrees

They call me heat miser, whatever I touch
Starts to melt in my clutch
I'm too much
They call me heat miser, whatever I touch
Starts to melt in my clutch
I'm too much
They call me heat miser, whatever I touch
Starts to melt in my clutch
I'm too much

I never wanna see a day under 60 degrees
I'd rather have it 80 or 100 degrees
I never wanna see a day under 60 degrees
I'd rather have it 80 or 100 degrees

He's mister green Christmas, he's mister sun
He's mister heat blister, he's mister 101
He's mister green Christmas, he's mister sun
Bum-ba-bum
He's mister heat blister, he's mister 101

I never wanna see a day under 60 degrees 
I'd rather have it 80 or 100 degrees
I never wanna see a day under 60 degrees 
I'd rather have it 80 or 100 degrees
