Lyrics:


Everyone is up in my face, need to get out of this place, it's hard to see with you in front
of my face, just another perfect day, acting like they wanna talk to me, so fake yet so
friendly. My eyes can see even the back of me, won't you just let me be.

Cause everyone is falling away, feel like they're stolen from me, wish everything didn't
happen to me, all I want is faith, love and happiness. Everytime one runs away another one's
returning, I wish everyone could just see your face. Faith, love, and happiness. 

It seems everyone is up in my space, like it's the American way, I run in case somebody takes
my place, just another change of pace. I know you think you know a lot about me, but so many
wanna doubt me. My eyes can even see the back of me, won't you just let me be.

Cause everyone is falling away, feel like they're stolen from me, wish everything didn't
happen to me, all I want is faith, love, and happiness. Everytime one runs away another one's
returning, I wish everyone could just see your face. Faith, love, and happiness.

Every which way I turn I've got the option of a million choices, every single word I say is
judged by a million critics. Every which way you turn you hear the sound of a million voices.
Every single move you make is torn by a million cynics. When will we all see the light of day?
I don't know.

Cause everyone is falling away, feel like they're stolen from me, wish everything didn't
happen to me, all I want is faith, love, and happiness. Everytime one runs away another one's
returning, I wish everyone could just see your face. Faith, love, and happiness.
