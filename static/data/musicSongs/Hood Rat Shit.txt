Lyrics:


I want to do it 'cause it's fun
It's fun to do bad things
(Hood rat shit)
Drive into a car (Ahh)
Did you know you could perhaps kill somebody? (Mwuah)
Yes, but I wanted to do hood rat stuff with my friends
Ayy, ayy, yeah

Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy)
Everywhere we go (Yeah) we be drinking Hen (Ayy)
Shake that ass, shake that ass, bitch, bounce that shit (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh, yeah) hood rat shit (Ayy)
Doing hood rat shit (Yeah) with my hood rat friends (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy)
Doing hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ahh)

I'm from South Park
I be in Dead End
I move to the 'burbs and put my friends on some licks
They wanna know 'bout me
They say, "Tell me your story"
Only thing you need to know is I'm in love with the money
Out here and I'm getting it, ayy
Young rich bitch, I'm pretty, ayy
Little bitty boys, big titties
Whole lotta hot shit, hot shit, hot shit
405-0 can't stop shit
All my niggas gon' pop shit, ayy
Big ol', big ol', big ol' ass, all my bitches gonna pop shit

Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy)
Everywhere we go (Yeah) we be drinking Hen (Ayy)
Shake that ass, shake that ass, bitch, bounce that shit (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh, yeah) hood rat shit (Ayy)
Doing hood rat shit (Yeah) with my hood rat friends (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy)
Doing hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ahh)

Bitch, keep talking that shit from your Honda
Hoes love to act, but they ain't with the drama
Want my spot? Gotta fight like Wakanda
Bitch, run up and get hit with the one-done
Hood rat shit, yeah, with my hood rat friends
You ain't from my hood
What you doing round here?
Asking all them questions
You must be the Feds
Better get from round here
'Fore you wind up dead

Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy)
Everywhere we go (Yeah) we be drinking Hen (Ayy)
Shake that ass, shake that ass, bitch, bounce that shit (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh, yeah) hood rat shit (Ayy)
Doing hood rat shit (Yeah) with my hood rat friends (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy)
Doing hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ahh)

Moved out the hood but I still throw that bitch up
Came in the club with a clique full of shooters
Niggas get stiff, they call me Medusa
I don't wanna fuck without the Medula
Hood rich, doing hood shit
That ain't no champagne in my glass, ho
This some Henny bitch
At the strip eating chicken wings with a thick bitch
Make it clap
She be dancing just like the diamonds up in my necklace

Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy)
Everywhere we go (Yeah) we be drinking Hen (Ayy)
Shake that ass, shake that ass, bitch, bounce that shit (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh, yeah) hood rat shit (Ayy)
Doing hood rat shit (Yeah) with my hood rat friends (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy)
Doing hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ahh)
