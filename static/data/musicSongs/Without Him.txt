Lyrics:


Without Him I could do nothing
Without Him I'd surely fail
Without Him I would be drifting
Like a ship without a sail

Jesus, oh Jesus
Do you know Him today
Do not turn Him away
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Without Him how lost I would be

Without Him I would be dying
Without Him I'd be enslaved
Without Him life would be hopeless
But with Jesus, thank God I'm saved

Jesus, oh Jesus
Do you know Him today
Do not turn Him away
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Without Him how lost I would be

Without Him how lost I would be
