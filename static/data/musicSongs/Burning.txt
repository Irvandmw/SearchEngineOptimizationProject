Lyrics:


I've been sleeping
Barely dreaming
Through one year and one half
Found another
Called him my lover
Helped me get my old self back

It was you
It was you
Only you
You remind me, oh, you bring me back

And you said
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning

Oh, I was reckless
Once was breathless
Running from that day I snapped
But I've got a feeling
And keep believing
I'm never gonna give this back

It was you
It was you
Only you
Oh, I'm never gonna give this back

And you said
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning

And if you're giving up, would you tell me?
I'm gonna keep this love if you let me
And if you're giving up, would you tell me?
I'm gonna keep this love

And you said
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning
