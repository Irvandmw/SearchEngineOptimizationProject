Lyrics:


The question is why, why are we here?
To say our hello's and goodbye's and then disappear
This beautiful life, what is it for?
To learn how to master peace or master war

There's only one answer that matters
Even if your heart has been shattered
Whatever you want, whatever you are after
Love is still the answer
Love is still the answer

We all make mistakes, no, we're not perfect yet
Maybe God made us all from an accident
The question that sits on everyone's lips
Is why should we pick ourselves up and start over again

Well, there's only one answer that matters
Even if your heart and your dreams have been shattered
Whatever you want, whatever you are after
Love is still the answer

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

The question I'll ask at the end of my days
Is what did I give and what will I take

Well, there's only one answer that matters
Even if your heart and your dreams have been shattered
Whatever you want, whatever you are after
Love is still the answer
Love is still the answer

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

'Cause what the world needs now is love
And all you need is love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
