Lyrics:


The night is young and you're so beautiful
Here among the shadows beautiful lady
Open your heart the sea is set the breezes sing of it
Can't you get into the swing of it
Lady where do we start

When the lady is kissable
And the evening so cool
Any dream is permissible
In the heart of a fool

Oh the moon is high and you're so glamorous
And if I seem over amorous
Lady what can I do
The night is young and I'm in love with you

The moon is high and you're so glamorous
And if I seem over amorous
Lady what can I do
The night is young and I'm in love with you
