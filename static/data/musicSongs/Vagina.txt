Lyrics:


Vagina was half-boy, half-girl
Her hair was shorter than mine
She told me she lived in the city
I never knew when she was lying
I first saw her in a gay bar (gay bar)
Kissing another girl
I told her, baby, I'm looking for a turn on
And she said, welcome to my world (welcome to my world)
Vagina was half-boy, half-girl
She taught me how to dance
Used to do it, used to do it with the TV on
Political romance

Half-boy, half-girl
Best of both worlds
Half-boy, half-girl
Best of both worlds

Vagina was half-boy, half-girl
She had her own way of doing things
But baby, she should have been king
'Cause she was so strong and so understanding

Oh, ooh
Vagina (la, la, la, la)
Oh, ooh
Oh, oh, la, la, la, la, oh
Oh, oh, la, la, la, la, oh
Vaginaâ¦

Vagina was half-boy, half-girl
You never told me how you got your name
I guess you wanted a little fame
I guess you got what you wanted
You got what you wanted, girl

Half-boy, half-girl
Best of both worlds (sing it now)
Half-boy, half-girl (oh)
Best of both worlds (everybody now)
Half-boy, half-girl (oh, oh)
Best of both worlds
Half-boy, half-girl
Best of both worlds
Half-boy, half-girl (oh, oh)
Best of both worlds (oh, yeah)
Half-boy, half-girl
Best of both worlds (vagina, vagina, vagina...)
