Lyrics:


That ain't the baby
That's my baby
Yah yah yah
Ha ha
Ei
First things first

His girlfriend says she love me I'm the truth (ugh, ugh)
I'm a dogie when I tap the hoes I hoof (yah)
They go to baby tellin' new good if (poof, hoo)
We got bitches kissin', bitches gettin' loose (huh)
In a way to ain't the beast and pussy that's a (hooh)
I'm on my tip-toes and she feel like (hooh)
I had to climb about the day she had me (ugh)
Yeah that's the forty if you play that bigger bone
And I'll be doggie all of these they [?] (poof)
Don't need no gatorade good bitch I've got to choose

Bitch I'm shit I know I smell like number two
Check out my outfit I'm freshest in the room (that ain't to say [?] see my baby) (ugh)
His girlfriend says she love me I'm the truth
I'm a dogie when I tap the hoes I hoof (yah)
They go to baby tellin' new good if (poof)

I'm boy medication in my mountain dew
Got a biz to stay Cali in the same city snoop
But the fly out to Miami found my bitch [?] blue
I fuck around and bought some sandals to the beach
I got some sand below my feet
I call the [?] freak
Good guys just stand to see they tip
Look guys they want my bitches above
She order my dick she lickin' my bob
D*ck in the fork
Shut us the words
I hate the [?] nigga pissin' his job

Pause you do not want any ex in my nigga just copy my nigga quick act
You can get flipped like a ma fuckin' match
Come and collect like some ma fuckin' tax
I'm in the store with my daughter and baby
Mama get it on [?] think that I'm lackin'
The mama baby Jesus see they can't believe
To see the solid nigga makin' me up
