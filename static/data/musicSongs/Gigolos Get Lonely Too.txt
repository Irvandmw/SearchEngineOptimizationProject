Lyrics:


I guess you've heard of my reputation
I've had my share of foolin' around
But everybody needs stimulation
And mine just happens to be all over town
It's an easy money occupation
A first-class psychiatry
But just once, I'd like to make love without taking off my clothes
Just once, I wanna make love with somebody who really and truly knows

Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too
All my lovers need stimulation
But honey, babe, I think that I need you

Maybe you're the kind of person
Tat could turn my world around
Won't you gimme a little inspiration?
Maybe that's what I need to make me settle down
It's an easy money occupation
But honey, one thing, understand
I've got more money than you could imagine in your wildest dreams
But honey, money don't make no happy man 'cause

Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too (Yes they do)
All my lovers need stimulation
But honey, babe, I think that I need you

Just once, I wanna love without takin' off my clothes
Just once, I wanna love with somebody who knows
That I got more money than you could ever see
But honey, money won't make me get me up off my knees

Gigolos get lonely too, yeah
All my lovers need stimulation
But honey, babe, I think that I need you
Contrary to rumor (Yeah), gigolos get lonely too
All my women need stimulation, yeah
Honey, babe (Honey, babe)
You babe
