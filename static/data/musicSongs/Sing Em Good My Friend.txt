Lyrics:


He was sellin' an old guitar and I bought it
I saw her smilin' picture in his wallet
He said I call her baby but her Christian name is, Charlotte.

She spends her days downtown hooked up to some machine
They say time can heal, but time can't heal everything
The lords gonna take her home real soon flyin' on, angels wings

I'm gonna cry right now and that's okay
We're all gonna die, someday
You won't remember a single word I'm tryin' to say

It's all a grand delusion when you think you're in control
She's all I got left, I'm sellin' everything I own
There's no good in a goodbye, it's the beginning of the end
I left some songs in this guitar
Sing Em' Good My Friend

Ah Yeah

This old guitar case has been a million miles
Been a fools disciple, missed dance recitals, and the birth of every child
Honestly, honesty never goes out of style
Sing the pain my friend

So the world see's her as just desperate, gray, and old
All I see is my true love, my heart, my life, my soul
At least for one more night I got a beautiful wrinkled hand to hold
Sing the truth my friend.

I'm gonna cry right now and that's okay
We're all gonna die, someday
You won't remember a single word I'm tryin' to say

It's all a grand delusion when you think you're in control
She's all I got left, I'm sellin' everything I own
There's no good in a goodbye, it's the beginning of the end
I left some songs in this guitar
Sing Em' Good My Friend

I'm gonna sing the pain away
I'm gonna sing the truth, and then
I'm gonna sing em' good, for my old friend

Well I cried when I got in my truck, so I put on my shades
Looked up at the crimson sky, as the sun began to fade
And for the first time, in a long time, I swear
I think I prayed

I'm gonna sing the pain away
I'm gonna sing the truth, and then
I'm gonna sing em' good, for my old friend
Yeah my old friend.
