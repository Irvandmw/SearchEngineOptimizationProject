Lyrics:


Baby, I could praise you
Try to turn your head around
Could you take a compliment
Oh-oh, and
Everything I say you
I find a way to drown it out
Make it like an argument

I see you a different way
So take my eyes to borrow
Keep a window for me open, open for me
Always, please don't lock the door
I'll be your special somebody
Hands over your body
Keep you wanting more

I know you're not sleepin'
Thinking that the sky could fall
You never let the dreams get in
Oh-oh, and
The secrets that you're keepin'
Well, I want you to share them all
'Cause baby, I can handle it

Just hold my hand a different way
And take my eyes to borrow
Keep a window for me open, open for me
Always, please don't lock the door
I'll be your special somebody
Not just anybody
Keep you wanting more

You were the one
You were the one
You were the one
And I'm needin' ya

You were the one
You were the one
You were the one
And I need your love

You were the one
You were the one
You were the one
And I'm needin' ya

You were the one
You were the one
You were the one

Keep a window for me open, open for me
Always, please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
God, I love your body
Keep me wanting more

Keep a window for me open, open for me
Always, please don't lock the door
I'll be your special somebody
Hands over your body
Keep me wanting more

You were the one
You were the one
You were the one
And I'm needin' ya

You were the one
You were the one
You were the one
And I need your love

You were the one
You were the one
You were the one
And I'm needin' ya

You were the one
You were the one
You were the one
And I need your love
