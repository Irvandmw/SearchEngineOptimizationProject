Lyrics:


What goes underneath your armor
Underneath your clothes
Do you know?
Let's find out together
Let's find what we're looking for
We'll explore

Leave your house of mirrors, hear me out
Fear no consequence, forget your doubts

I don't know where the road leads
You don't know if I'll break your heart
We don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, start

Fall into the sea of possibility
And hope
We're letting go
Float away with me
Until we can't see any coast
That we know

Hold on tight until we become one
Find our island underneath the sun

I don't know where the road leads
You don't know if I'll break your heart
And we don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, ooh, start, yeah

Our beloved beside us
All you want to give up
Only happens if we let it live

And I don't know where the road leads
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You don't know if I'll break your heart
We don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, start, yeah

Oh unless we start
Ooh, oh, let's start, yeah
Unless we start
