Lyrics:


Every day here you come walking
I hold my tongue, I don't do much talking
You say you're happy and you're doin' fine
Well, go ahead, baby, I got plenty of time

Because sad eyes never lie
Because sad eyes never lie 

Well, for awhile I've been watching you steady
Ain't gonna move 'til you're good and ready
You show up and then you shy away
But I know pretty soon you'll be walkin' this way

Because sad eyes never lie
Because sad eyes never lie 

Baby, don't you know I don't care
Don't you know that I've been there
Well, if something in the air feels a little unkind
Don't worry, darling, it'll slip your mind 

I know you think you'd never be mine
Well, that's OK, baby, I don't mind
That shy smile's sweet, that's a fact
Go ahead, I don't mind the act

Here you come all dressed-up for a date
Well, one more step and it'll be too late

Blue blue ribbon in your hair
Like you're so sure I'll be standing there

I guess sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
Never lie, never lie

Sad eyes 
Sad eyes 
Sad eyes 
Sad eyes 
Never lie
Sad eyes 
Sad eyes 
Never lie
