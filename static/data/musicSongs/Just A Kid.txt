Lyrics:


[Chorus]
They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it we ridinâ
Fuck it we ridinâ
Playinâ games to ease your mind
Damn Iâm high
Damn Iâm high
And I know (I know)
That they (that they)
Never understand
Cause Iâm just (Iâm just)
A kid (a kid)
But they tell me Iâm the man

[Verse 1]
Hey hey
I be goofy, kinda funny
Acting stupid but they love me
We donât do it for the money
Just some food up in my tummy
Feelinâ cool, living great
In the mood, tryna sway
Ice cubes in my drink
Never doing what they say
They some losers full of hate
A nuisance gettinâ cake
What Iâm doing everyday probably ruin all your game
I got some brand new clothes fresh right out the package
The moon looking like I can reach right up and grab it
So close to the sky Iâm high
Was a youngâun who would hope to be fly
Oh my God
Now Iâm everywhere with my squad
When I spit a rhyme they applaud and I say
Thank you, thank you
Youâre far too kind
You heard everybody music
But wait til you hear mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If you know me, you are hatinâ?
Listen homie, Iâve been waiting
For a golden opportunity
To know that Iâma make it
Where Iâm going I could take it
Went from flowing in the basement
To show in all stages
On the road to different places
Got they thumbs in the air
Smile on they faces
Fans with grey hair and fans rocking braces
Fans who be buying me drinks to get me wasted
Groupie hoes, thirsty as hell they wanna taste it
See this life even shocks me
I got some people on my nuts call jockey
And I ain't even gettin cocky
But if you hatin Iâma tell you this âWatch meâ
Bout to do something amazing bro
World changing my brain got a gang of flows
And this for those who always came to shows
You were still by my side with no bank to blow

[Chorus]
