It ain't for everybody!
(Uh) Welcome to Hollywood baby
(Take a picture) Uh huh
You're coming with? (Let's not even talk about it)
Let's do it (Let's Go!)

I see your jealousy as you're watching
You're watching
It's kinda sexy to me how you're watching
You're watching

I see your face (I see your face)
You wanna touch it (You wanna touch it)
Come to my place (Come to my place)
And let's discuss it (Let's chop it up)
Tonight you'll be
A superstar
Come let me sign you up

(Let's get into it)

Oh it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Action! (You need that)
Hollywood
Oh it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Satisfaction! (You need that)
Hollywood

You got to get it
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Do you want it
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
But you don't need it
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
What do you do?
Oh oh oh
What do you do?
Oh oh oh
Hey

I see your face (I see your face)
You wanna touch it (You wanna touch it)
Come to my place (Come to my place)
And let's discuss it (Let's chop it up)
Tonight you'll be
A superstar
Come let me sign you up

Ooh it's the lights (It's the lights)
Action! (Action)
Hollywood (Hollywood)
Ooh it's the lights (Satisfaction)
Satisfaction! (So addictive)
(Hey) Hollywood (Hollywood)

You hear it screaming
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Camera's rolling
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
So addictive
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Like Hollywood
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

And everybody warning you about it
And once you taste you can't live without it
Not 'cause you choose to not live without it
It's now a part of you (It's now a part of you)
And everybody warning you about it
And once you taste you can't live

Ooh it's the lights (It's the lights)
Action! (Action)
Hollywood (Hollywood)
Ooh it's the lights (Satisfaction)
Satisfaction! (So addictive)
(Hey) Hollywood (Hollywood)

Now you wanna be seen
Male groupies
Now you become what you once despised
James Dean
John Belushi
Blow your whole life
Tryna live in the lights
Heroins following Marilyn Hoppin'
Over the edges
Just like Janice Joplin
River Phoenix
Jimi Hendrix
Jamie Morrison
All of them ended by
Hollywood

I see your face and a you wanna touch it(yeah)
Come to my place and we we can discuss it

Hollywood, welcome to Hollywood
