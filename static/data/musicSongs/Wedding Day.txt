Lyrics:


Girl we can never get divorce if I marry
You tryna find all the emotions I bury
You tryna see who I am tonight, but I vary
Shit that I learned, you can't learn in no library

You can be a suspect, you can be a custy
Still know how the trap work, even if I'm rusty
These are still the hood rules, this the way it must be
If you're not a main man, you can not discuss me
This is not for play now, things that I play about
Paid my mama house off, win a VMA now
Tryna buy a grotto, strappin' on the greyhound
Aimin' at the opps now, circling the playground
Virginia for real though, niggas sellin' rello
Touch a quarter mil, oh, weigh it by the kilo
I'm just sayin' facts now, you should see the B-roll
And I'm busy lowlight, tryna be a hero
You can be a suspect, you can be a custy
Still know how the trap work, even if I'm rusty
These are just the real facts, this the way it must be
If you're not a street dude, you can never touch me

It's just me and my wifey for life
This me and my side-piece if you like
Just me and my dying peace in the night
I don't mean to objectify her in the lie
But if she prefers to be a bad bitch tonight
Who am I to dishonor her sacrifice?
I don't want to just patronize
She like when I look her in her eyes

You can be a suspect, you can be a custy
Still know how the trap work, even if I'm rusty
These are still the hood rules, this the way it must be
If you're not a main man, you can not discuss me
This is not for play now, things that I play about
Paid my mama house off, win a VMA now
Tryna buy a grotto, strappin' on the greyhound
Aimin' at the opps now, circling the playground
Virginia for real though, niggas sellin' rello
Touch a quarter mil, oh, weigh it by the kilo
I'm just sayin' facts now, you should see the B-roll
And I'm busy lowlight, tryna be a hero

Rare James bitch in the mink coat
Act surprise, even though you know I been cold
Say you miss me, even though you say it in code
Still in love, all though we're no longer involved
Silk down, bitch, not a Rick Up
We made it to a Slim Jimmy from a Jim Crow
Only thing I never learn, how that I can simple
So close lips, close eyes, never info
'Cause these nights are the rarest
These nights excite, but these lights are the spirits
This life the life where you rewrite what your fear is
When you reach these heights you this life is the clearest
'Cause these nights are the rarest
These nights excite, but these lights are the spirits
When you reach these heights you rewrite what your fear is
Yes, I'm seein' my shit the clearest
