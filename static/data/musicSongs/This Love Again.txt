Lyrics:


Haven't you looked around.
You could have anyone.
So why would you look at me,
And feel any sympathy,
When all the world can see,
You're breaking me gently?

Cause this love. I've been dying for this love, again.
Oh, I missed love. I've been dying for this love, again.
Don't cut me, just to hear me screaming your name,
there's a million ways I can feel less pain,
so why oh why is it this love that I've been dying for?

So lay me down again
Watch what you've broken mend
Don't sharpen your tongue my dear
Cause your words are killing me
And making my heart burst
Is more than my blood is worth.

Yeah this love. I've been dying for this love, again.
Oh, I missed love. I've been dying for this love, again.
Don't cut me, just to hear me screaming your name,
there's a million ways I can feel less pain,
so why oh why is it this love that I've been dying for?

This love, I've been dying for this love, again.
Oh, I missed love. I've been dying for this love, again.
Don't cut me, just to hear me screaming your name,
there's a million ways I can feel less pain,
so why oh why is it this love that I've been dying for?
