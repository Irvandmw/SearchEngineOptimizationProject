Lyrics:


Variety's the spice of spirit, nothing's for free
Can you hear at all, branches fall from the tree
Smothered by the sound of silence, ran out of breath
Listen for the audience, the fans are deaf

They can't hear you anymore
Because they're all deaf
They can't hear you anymore
Because they're all dead

MP3's killed the record companies [x4]

Smothered by the sound of silence, ran out of breath
Listen for the audience, the fans are deaf
Variety's the spice of spirit, nothing's for free
Can you hear at all, branches fall from the tree

They can't hear you anymore
Because they're all deaf
They can't hear you anymore
Because they're all dead

MP3's killed the record companies [x4]

MP3's killed the record companies [x8]
