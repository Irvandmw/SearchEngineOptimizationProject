Lyrics:


I've never been in love before
Not like this you taught me more
How among myself will I
Lift up on myself and cry
'Cause I thought I could not give
My thought would not let me live
How my feeling disappeared
You are lovely reason I
Am alive you satisfy
All my senses and you give
Me the confidence to grow
In a thousand different ways
Happy just to spend the days
Of my lifetime by your side
I want to be
Everything that I can
I want so much
To be more of a man
I want to grow
I want to know you better
Each day I'll try
To love you
'Cause I've never been in love before
You have a friend for life in me
If we ever disagree
If you have to go away
I will set you free with time
'Cause your happiness is mine
May our light forever shine
When you always feel free
I want to be
Everything that I can
I want so much
To be more of a man
I want to live
I want to give my lifetime
Each day I'll try
To love you
'Cause I've never been in love before
