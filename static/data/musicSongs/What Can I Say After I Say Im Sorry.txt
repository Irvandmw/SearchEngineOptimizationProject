Lyrics:


Oh what can I say dear after I say I'm sorry
Oh what can I do to prove it to you I'm sorry
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do

I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should take somebody like you to shame you
I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say dear after I say I'm sorry

I know that I made you cry...
I'm sorry
