Lyrics:


Without a word of warning my life has begun
Without a word of warning two hearts beat as one
From out of nowhere you came to me
A breeze passed by whispering your name to me
And without a word of warning strange as it seems
We kissed and with that kiss you invaded my dreams
I don't know how it ever happened out of the blue up above
You came along to answer my song of love
I don't know how it ever happened out of the blue up above
You came along to answer my song of love
