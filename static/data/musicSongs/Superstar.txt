Everybody wants the lights lights
All the flashes, cause we're gonna rock the night, night
Break out your glasses
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Everybody wants the lights, lights
All the flashes, cause we're gonna rock the night, night
Break out your glasses
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar

[Lady Gaga:]
I want your number
Did I see you on the TV?
I wonder, I wonder
You got that something
That junoesque baby, I'm feeling love connection
Have we met before? (baby, cause I think I've seen you)
In a movie or on the radio? (I don't know, but I want you)
I'm not certain, but let's dance some more (baby, cause I think I've seen you)
Tonight you'll be my superstar
Tonight you'll be my superstar

[Lady Gaga & Rodney Jerkins:]
Everybody wants the lights lights
All the flashes, cause we're gonna rock the night, night
Take out your glasses
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Everybody wants the lights, lights
All the flashes, cause we're gonna rock the night, night
Take out your glasses
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar

[Lady Gaga:]
Want you to text me
I bet you could really Hollywood kiss me (Hollywood kiss me)
You've got that something
Were you in that movie with Scarlett Johansson? (Scarlett Johansson)
Have we met before (baby, cause I think I've seen you)
In a movie or on the radio? (I don't know but I want you)
I'm not certain but let's dance some more (baby, cause I think I've seen you)
Tonight you'll be my superstar, tonight you'll be my superstar

[Lady Gaga & Rodney Jerkins:]
Everybody wants the lights lights
All the flashes, cause we're gonna rock the night life
Take out your glasses
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar

[Lady Gaga:]
Don't really know who you are, but tonight you're gonna be my superstar
Come on baby move with me, can't you see?
I'm a celebrity
Don't really know who you are, but tonight you're gonna be my superstar
Come on baby move with me, can't you see?
I'm a celebrity

[Rodney Jerkins:]
Everybody wants the lights, lights
All the flashes, cause we're gonna rock the night, night
Break out your glasses
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Everybody wants the lights, lights
All the flashes, cause we're gonna rock the night, night
Break out your glasses
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
Tonight you are a superstar, superstar, superstar
