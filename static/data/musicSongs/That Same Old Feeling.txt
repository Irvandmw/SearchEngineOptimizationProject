Lyrics:


Each time I hold you when I feel good, uh huh
You know I do, uh-huh
When I'm away from you
I feel like you want me to
Ya put your arms around me and I get

I get that feelin'
That same old feelin'
If I lose that feelin' guess I'll die

Each time you kiss me when I feel good, uh-huh
You know I do, uh-huh
Don't you ever leave me
If you do you'll grieve me
Gonna wrap you in my arms real tight

And get that feelin'
That same old feelin'
If I lose that feelin' guess I'll die

I want that feelin'
Gotta have that feelin'
If I lose that feelin' guess I'll die
Guess I'll die, guess I'll do

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
