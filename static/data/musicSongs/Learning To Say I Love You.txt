Lyrics:


I am walking down the road tonight
And I wonder if they tell me right
They say you are caught under a spell
That just causes you to love me well
And I am learning, yes I am learning to say I love you, I love you

I am walking down the road tonight
And I hope that you think of me right
You are always there, your on my mind
I wish I could be with you for all time
And I am learning, yes I am learning to say I love you, I love you
Oh I am learning, yes I am learning to say I love you, I love you

Yeah they're three very simple words
But my lips wont work you see 
I'm trying to tell you just how I feel for you
Oh I'm trying to tell you just how I feel for you

And don't you know that I'm learning, oh I'm learning to say I love you
(Trying to tell you just how I feel for you)
Oh to say I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
