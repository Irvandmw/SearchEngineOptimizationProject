Lyrics:


When Johnny Jones was serenading Mary, 
He sure could quote a lot of poetry, 
But he'd much rather tell her, 
What he learned in his speller, 
When they both attended PS 33! 

A - You're adorable... 
B - You're so beautiful... 
C - You're a cutie full of charms... 
D - You're deliteful. . . 
E - You're so eligent... 
F - You're a feather in my arms... 
G - You look good to me... 
H - You're so heavenly... 
I - You're the one I idolize... 
J - We're like Jack and Jill... 

K - You're so kiss-able... 
L - You're the love-light of my eyes... 
M, N, O, P... 
I could go on all day... 
Q, R, S, T... 
Alphabetically speaking you're OK! 
U - Made my life complete... 
V - You're so very sweet... 
W, X, Y, Z... 
It's fun to wonder through, 
The alphabet with you, 
To tell you what you mean to me!
