Lyrics:


When whippoorwills call and evening is nigh
I hurry to my, my blue heaven
A turn to the right, you see a little white light
Will lead you to my, my blue heaven

You'll see a smilin' face, a fireplace, a cozy room
A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom
Just baby and me, oh how happy we'll be
Together in my, my blue heaven

You'll see a smilin' face, a fireplace, a cozy room
A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom
Just baby and me, oh how happy we'll be
Together in my, my blue heaven
We're happy in my, my blue heaven
We're happy in my, happy in my blue heaven
