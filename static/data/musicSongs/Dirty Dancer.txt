Enrique, Usher
This is for the dirty girls
All around the world
Here we go

Dirty dirty dancer

âNother day, ânother night
And she acting like she donât sleep
Sheâs a five when she drinks
But sheâs a ten when sheâs on top of me

She donât wanna love she just wanna touch
Sheâs a greedy girl to never get enough
She donât wanna love she just wanna touch
She's Got all the moves that make you get it up

Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Youâll never be her only

Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Youâll never be her only

Itâs a game
That she plays
She can win with her eyes closed
Itâs insane how she tames
She can turn you to an animal

She donât wanna love she just wanna touch
Sheâs a greedy girl to never get enough
She donât wanna love she just wanna touch
Sheâs got all the moves that make you give it up

Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Youâll never be her only

Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Youâll never be her only

Never be her only

She never satisfied
You better do it right
Before youâre lonely

No, sheâs never satisfied
You better do it right
Before youâre lonely

Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Youâll never be her only

Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Youâll never be her only
Youâll never be her only

The girl donât stop
Dirty dancer

The girl donât stop
The girl donât stop
Dirty dancer

The girl donât stop
The girl donât stop
Dirty dancer

The girl donât stop
The girl donât stop
