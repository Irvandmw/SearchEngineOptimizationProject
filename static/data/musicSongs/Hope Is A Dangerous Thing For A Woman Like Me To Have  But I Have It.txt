Lyrics:


I was reading Slim Aarons
And I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed
If I was tested less like all of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses
And high heels on white yachts
But I'm not
Baby I'm not
No, I'm not
That I'm not

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on the walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have

I had fifteen-year dances
Church basement romances yeah I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage which I also call home when I'm not
Serving up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi dad"

I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman with my past

There's a new revolution
A loud evolution
That I saw
Born of confusion
And quiet collusion
Of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman
With a weak constitution
'Cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed
That I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping
The keys on my nights off

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have
