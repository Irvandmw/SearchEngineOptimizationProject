Lyrics:


Beautiful girls, 
Walk a little slower, 
When you walk by me! 
Lingering sunsets, 
Stay a little longer, 
With the lonely sea! 
Children everywhere, 
When you shoot at bad men, 
Shoot at me! 
Take me to that strange enchanted land, 
Grown-ups seldom understand! 

Wandering rainbow, 
Leave a bit of color, 
For my heart to own! 
Stars in the sky, 
Make my wish come true, 
Before the night has flown, 

And let the music play, as long, 
As there's a song to sing, 
And I will stay younger than spring! 

Wandering rainbow, 
Leave a bit of color, 
For my heart to own! 
Stars in the sky, 
Make my wish come true, 
Before the night has flown... 

And let the music play, as long, 
As there's a song to sing, 
And I will stay younger, 
In every way younger, 
Yes, I will stay younger than the spring!
