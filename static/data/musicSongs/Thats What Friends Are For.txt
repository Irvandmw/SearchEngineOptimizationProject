Lyrics:


And I never thought I'd feel this way, 
And as far as I'm concerned, 
I'm glad I got a chance to say, 
That I do believe I love you! 

And if I should ever go away, 
Well then close your eyes and try, 
to feel the way we do today! 
And then if you can remember... 

Keep smiling! 
Keep shining! 
Knowing you can always count on me, 
For sure! 
And that's what friends are for! 

For good times! 
And bad times! 
I'll be on your side forever more! 
That's what friends are for! 

And so, by the way, I thank you and then, 
For the times when we're apart, 
Well then close your eyes and know, 
These words are comin' from my heart! 
And then if you can remember... 

Keep smiling! 
Keep shining! 
Knowing you can always count on me, 
For sure! 
And that's what friends are for! 

In good times! 
And bad times! 
I'll be on your side forever more! 
That's what friends are for!
