Lyrics:


If you really gotta know I'm not doing so good
Turned out to hurt more than I thought it would

Cause I
Just can't handle losing you again
But the last thing I want is just to be your friend
Been through this same thing time and time again
Let's pretend

Let's pretend everything's fine
Put on our fake smiles and keep wasting our time
Let's pretend we're fine
Go out in style and come home in denial
Let's pretend we're fine

If you really gotta know I'm not doing so good
(ah)
Hurt me way more than I thought it could

Cause I
Just can't handle losing you again
But the last thing I want is just to be your friend
Been through this same thing time and time again
Let's pretend (pretend)

Let's pretend everything's fine
Put on our fake smiles and keep wasting our time
Let's pretend we're fine
Go out in style and come home in denial
Let's pretend we're fine

Lie . . . to ourselves
(if they don't look closer then they all believe it)
Lie . . . to everyone else
(we can hold hands and we'll know that we're friends)

I can't take anymore of the make believe romance
It's killing my make believe heart (killing my make believe heart)
But I'd rather pretend we're together than know we're apart

Let's pretend everything's fine
Put on our fake smiles and keep wasting our time
Let's pretend we're fine
Go out in style and come home in denial
Let's pretend we're fine
(if they don't look close then they all believe it)
Let's pretend we're fine
(we can hold hands and we'll know that we're friends)
Let's pretend we're fine
