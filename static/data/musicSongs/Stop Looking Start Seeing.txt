Lyrics:


Hit or miss, fuck or fight
It's time to live your life
Go ahead, I know I'm right
I'm gonna lay it on the line
Put yourself in my shoes
Would you stand up for your rights
Line em up and knock em down
I'm not running scared tonight

[Chorus:]
I have climbed these walls before
And I'm not scared anymore
There's a time to lead and a time to follow
Because I won't take this anymore (these walls)
I've climbed these walls before (these walls)
There's a time to lead and a time to follow (these walls)

I see the walls closing in
And I feel I'm in danger
My enemy is not alone
In the mirror, there's a stranger
As I tried to break out
My panic led to fear
Hopeless, I am alone
I'm afraid the end is near

The truth doesn't always have to hurt

[Chorus]

Stop looking
Start seeing NOW
Right Now [x2]

Why does the truth always have to hurt?

[Chorus]
