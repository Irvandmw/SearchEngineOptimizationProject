Lyrics:


I cheated just to get on by
Yea, I cheated just to get on by
If I can't save my sinning ways
Gonna keep on getting high

I'm sleeping off a weekend drunk
I'm sleeping off a weekend drunk
When I'm awake I'm looking back
At all the ships I sunk

Two fingers of whiskey
Good old fashioned rye
Wish I were bound for glory
And prohibition dry

Two fingers of whiskey
That is all I need
To keep drownin the devil
Living in me
Living in me

I'm hanging on the hook of the moon
I'm hanging on that crescent moon
If I don't get out of this bottle
Lord you're gonna see me soon

Just like a dog, I wanna howl
Like an old dog, I wanna howl
Used up all of my aces
Who is gonna save me now?

Two fingers of whiskey
Good old fashioned rye
Wish I were bound for glory
And prohibition dry

Two fingers of whiskey
That is all I need
To keep drownin the devil
Living in me
Living in me

Two fingers of whiskey
Good old fashioned rye
Wish I were bound for glory
And prohibition dry

Two fingers of whiskey
That is all I need
To keep drowning the devil
Living in me
Living in me
Living in me
