Lyrics:


I have been crying, 
since you hung up the phone. 
I was more in love, 
to admit I was wrong. 
What kind of girl 
would do what I attempt? 
It's going to take a real man, 
to forget and forgive. 

Don't leave. 
Don't leave tonight. 
I know I was wrong, 
and I know you were right. 
We all make mistakes, 
so lets not keep count. 
So don't leave me here, 
no not tonight. 

Give me one reason 
I shouldnât walk out the door. 
You took me for granted, 
and Iâm worth a whole lot more. 
You say that youâre sorry, 
but you never seem to change. 
well I should never buy me flowers, 
but you always bring me pain. 

(But I'm begging baby, ooooh) 
Don't leave me, (no whoo) 
don't leave tonight. 
I know I was wrong, 
and I know you were right. 
We all make mistakes, 
so lets not keep count. 
so don't leave me here, 
no not tonight. 

Cause I'm tired of fussing and fighting all night. 
Baby don't leave me, 
stay here tonight. 
Don't leave, babe, babe. 
Don't leave tonight. 
(noo oooh-ooh). 

Cause I'm tired of fussing and fighting all night. 
Baby don't leave me stay here tonight. 
Don't leave me. 
Don't leave tonight. 
Don't leave me. 
Don't leave tonight. 

I was wrong (So wrong, so wrong). 
And I know you were right. 
We all make mistakes, 
so let's not keep count, count, count it over. 
So don't (don't) leave, me here, no not tonight. 
Woooh baby, don't leave me, don't leave me tonight....
