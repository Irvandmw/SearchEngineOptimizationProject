Lyrics:


All the key-bump thrills
All the suicide pills
Take the dose you swear by
Multiply ten times
From the bathroom stalls
Through the hotel walls
Watch the faded ladies
On fake eighties

And we're doing it 'til we die

Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it 'til we die
Chasing the first time

All the smoke and mirrors
Can't quite calm the fear
Cause the past it hurt ya
You medicate the future

And we're doing it 'til we die

Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it 'til we die
Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it til we die
Chasing the first time

Nothing lasts forever, no
All we are is temporary
Nothing lasts forever, no
All we are is temporary
Spend our lives searching for
That once in a lifetime

And we're doing it 'til we die

Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it 'til we die
Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it 'til we die
Chasing the first time
