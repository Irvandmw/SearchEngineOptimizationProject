Lyrics:


You and your beautiful eyes
That tell such beautiful lies
Oh when you start that hocus pocus
Boy, things get out of focus

You and the way that you kiss
Well they ought to give you a prize
Baby you could make a statue come to life just a-looking at you
You and your beautiful eyes

You (you're so observant) and your beautiful eyes
That tell (the lies you're selling) such beautiful lies (may start my head a-swelling)
When (tell me some more) you start that hocus pocus (jumping Jimminy Crickets)
(Both) Boy, things get out of focus

(Well talk about you) Well honey please do
(And the way that you kiss) You'll like this
(You ought to stage a big parade and give you a prize)
Your lips lets try them on for size oh baby
You could make a statue come to life just a-looking at you
(Don't stop) Gee but you're beautiful
Oh but they're beautiful
(Both) You and your beautiful eyes
(Both) Yes you and your beautiful eyes
