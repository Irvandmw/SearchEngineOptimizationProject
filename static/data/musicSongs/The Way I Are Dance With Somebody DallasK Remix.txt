Lyrics:


I'm sorry, I'm not the most pretty
I'll never ever sing like Whitney
Ooh, but I still wanna dance with somebody

So let's let our hearts bleed, 'til they turn to rust
Gonna live it up, 'cause it's dangerous
No, I don't wanna play the part
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?
Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

Just wanna dance with somebody
Just wanna dance with somebody
Just wanna dance with somebody

I'm sorry, that my lyrics ain't cool
I know, that I'm not, what you're used to
Ooh, but I still wanna dance with somebody

So let's let all hearts bleed, 'til they turn to rust
Gonna live it up, 'cause it's dangerous
No, I don't wanna play the part
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?
Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

Just wanna dance with somebody
Just wanna dance with somebody
Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?
Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
