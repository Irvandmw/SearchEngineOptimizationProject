Lyrics:


Bring my Baby, bring my baby back, Santa
Bring my Baby, bring my baby back to me

I've been so lonely since she's been gone
Can't seem to get a grip, barely holdin' on
And here it is, Christmas Eve
So hard to believe she's not here with me

Santa Claus, will you bring my baby back to me?
I sent a letter to you, every word is true, she's everything I need
Santa please bring my baby back to me

Heard there's a storm on it's way tonight
Hope to see a white Christmas in the morning light
If I could only see her next to me
What a wonderful sight that would be

Santa Claus, will you bring my baby back to me?
I sent a letter to you, every word is true, she's everything I need
Santa please bring my baby back to me

There's no place like home, for the holidays
Who wants to be alone underneath the mistletoe
I want the stars to twinkle and those bells to jingle
While we're sleddin' through the snow

Santa Claus, will you bring my baby back to me"
I sent a letter to you, every word is true, she's everything I need
Santa please bring my baby back to me
Dear Santa, bring my baby back to me
What a holiday, in every way, what a Merry Christmas it would be
Santa please bring my baby back to me
