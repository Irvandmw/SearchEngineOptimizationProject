Lyrics:


I bought a brand new airmobile,
'twas a custom made, 'twas a Flight DeVille
With a powerful motor and a hide away wing,
Push in on the button, you
will hear her sing

Now you can't catch me,
Baby, you can't catch me
'cause if you get too close,
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze

Hey! Hey!
Well, you walk!
You walk!

New Jersey turnpike in the wee wee hours,
I was rollin' slowly 'cause
of drizzlin showers
Here come a flat-top, he was
movin' up with me,
Then come waving goodbye in a
little old souped up jitney
I put my foot in the tank, I began to roll,
Moanin' siren, 'twas the state patrol
I let out my wings, then I blew my horn,
Bye-bye, New Jersey, I become airborn

Now you can't catch me,
Baby, you can't catch me
'cause if you get too close,
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze

Hey!
Well, you walk!
Yeah, walk!

I bought a brand new airmobile,
'twas a custom made, 'twas a flightning deal
With a powerful motor and a hide away wing,
Push in on the button, you
will hear her sing

Now you can't catch me,
Baby, you can't catch me
'cause if you get too close,
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze

Hey! Hey!
Well, you walk!
You walk!

Flying with my baby last Saturday night,
Wasn't a grey cloud floatin' in sight
Big, full moon, shinin' up above,
Cuddle up, honey, be my love

Sweetest little thing that I ever seen,
I'm gonna name you Maybellene
Flying on the beam, set on flight control,
Radio tuned to rock and roll
Two, three hours passed us by,
Altitude dropped into five-o-five
Fuel consumption, way too fast,
Let's get on home before we run out of gas

Now you can't catch me,
Baby, you can't catch me
'cause if you get too close,
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze

Git it on!
Yeah, walk!
Git it on, git it on, git it on, do it!
Git it on, git it on!
You know you can't catch me!
