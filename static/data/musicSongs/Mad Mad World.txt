Lyrics:


Everybody's runnin' in a mad, mad world
But nobody's goin' nowhere
Everybody's gotta have more than the others
Gotta have more than their share

Ever since the devil tempted woman with an apple
We've all had a burden to bare
Now the world keeps turnin' and things are gettin' faster
Nobody's goin' nowhere

They say the grass is greener on the other side
When they cross over they find
Everybody's searchin' like you and me
Tryin' to find peace of mind

See that little boy fishin' on the river
If I could just be like him
I'd close my eyes and let the mad world go by
If only I could be like him

See that little boy fishin' on the river
If I could just be like him
I'd close my eyes and let the mad world go by
If only I could be like him
I'd close my eyes and let the mad world go by
If only I could be like him
