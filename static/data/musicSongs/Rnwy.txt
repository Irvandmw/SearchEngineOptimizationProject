Lyrics:


Graâ
Grafitti sky

I donât think youâre all ready
Yo, I donât think youâre all ready

Grafitti decourations
Under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension
Still giving me away
The lessons Iâve forgotten
In spite of all Iâve learned
Now, I find myself in question
Point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point the finger at me again

I want to runaway (I want to runaway)
I want to know the truth (I want to know the truth)
I want to know the answers (I want to know the answers)
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind

Paperbags and angry voices
Under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension
Wonât seem to go away
All my talk of starting over
These words were never true
Now, I find myself in question
Point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point the finger at me again

I want to run away (I want to runaway)
I want to know the truth (I want to know the truth)
I want to know the answers (I want to know the answers)
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind

Going to runaway
Going to runaway (way)
Going to runaway
Going to runaway (way, way)
Going to runaway

Hey, yâall not ready
Hey, yo

I donât think yâall ready for what Iâm about to do
All you new-skool dudes ainât even got no clue
How dare you forget about Bam and Zue Lue
Cool Herc and Jazzy J.
They paved the way
Let me spit it for yâall who said I wasnât going to make it
Every time I blaze it, yâall the first to hate it
My team reigns supreme to stay strong
Got the true series, son
They scared to put us on
Canât get with hybrids
Get off your hiatus
To many yâallâs dying for it
So, I got to blaze it
Still ripping BK, Brooklyn, B and on
Hell-fighting family, aliennation
Banging hits in the backyard while LPâs on
Iâm a little communicate
Phoenix Orion

I want to runaway (I want to runaway)
I want to know the truth (I want to know the truth)
I want to know the answers (I want to know the answers)
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind
