Lyrics:


Been so damn faded lately, dunno if it's day or night
Ain't coming back to earth alone, don't wanna waste the high

We on a free fall, on and on for eons
No gravity, baby
Not gonna sleep on it, I'ma put some heat on it
Not gonna sleep, baby

I just wanna feel what it's like
To be underneath your glow
Like we're on the moon, baby
Trippin' on the, trippin' on the moon, baby
I just wanna feel the dark side
Be your nocturnal midnight
Like we're on the moon, baby
Stars drippin' on the moon, baby

Take me all the way, baby, baby, take me to your Milky Way
I just wanna rock, rocket ride into space

We on a free fall, on and on for eons
No gravity, baby
Not gonna sleep on it, I'ma put some heat on it
Not gonna sleep, baby

I just wanna feel what it's like
To be underneath your glow
Like we're on the moon, baby
Trippin' on the, trippin' on the moon, baby
I just wanna feel the dark side
Be your nocturnal midnight
Like we're on the moon, baby
Stars drippin' on the moon, baby

I just wanna feel what it's like
To be underneath your glow
Like we're on the moon, baby
Trippin' on the, trippin' on the moon, baby
I just wanna feel the dark side
Be your nocturnal midnight
Like we're on the moon, baby
Stars drippin' on the moon, baby
