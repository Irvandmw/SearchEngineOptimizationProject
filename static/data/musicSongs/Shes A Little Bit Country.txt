Lyrics:


She's a big city girl in so many ways she walks and she talks up town
She's got something hard to find now-a-days that keeps me hangin' around

She's a little bit country makes me think of meadows and clover
Apple pie and a puppy named Rover and the good old days
Now she don't know what cheatin' means
I ain't got to teach her none of them things
She's a little bit country and I got country ways
I've been all around this trouble old world but I never found peace of mind
Till I met that pretty little city girl Lord you oughta make more of her kind

She's a little bit country makes me think of meadows and clover...
She's a little bit country and I got country ways
