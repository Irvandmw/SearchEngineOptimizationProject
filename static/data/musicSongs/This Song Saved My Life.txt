Lyrics:


I wanna start by letting you know this
Because of you my life has a purpose
You helped me be who i am today
I see myself in every word you say
Sometimes it feels like nobody gets me
Trapped in a world where everyone hates me
There's so much that I'm going through
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you

[Chorus:]
I was broken
I was choking
I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding
Stopped believing
Could have died
This song saved my life
I was down
I was drowning
But it came on just in time
This song saved my life

Sometimes I feel like you've known me forever
You always know how to make me feel better
Because of you, my dad and me
Are so much closer than we used to be
You're my escape when I'm stuck in a small town
I turn you up whenever I feel down
You let me know like no one else
That it's OK to be myself

[Chorus]

You'll never know what it means to me
That I'm not alone
That I'll never have to be

[Chorus 2x]

[4x]
My life, my life
(This song saved my life)
