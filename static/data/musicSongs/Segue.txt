[*phone rings*]

[Vanessa:]
Hello

[Prince:]
Vanessa?

[Vanessa:]
I'm not recording this time
So how are you?

[Prince:]
How are you?

[Vanessa:]
Fine

[Prince:]
Fine

[Vanessa:]
Excuse me, but ah, what's up with your voice?

[Prince:]
It's a special phone, a tone box

[Vanessa:]
A tongue box. Oh, l-like in the movie Barbarella

[Prince:]
Yeah, gives me courage, you know
Like a veil I can hide behind
It talks at, around, through her

[Vanessa:]
Okay, so why are you giving me an interview?

[Prince:]
Because I want you

[Vanessa:]
Pardon me?

[Prince:]
To tell the truth

[Vanessa:]
Oh - well, I will if you will
For example, the first song of your opera

[Prince:]
Ah, the opera

[Vanessa:]
Why don't you tell me your real name

[Prince:]
My name is Victor

[Vanessa:]
That is not the truth and you know it
How old are you?

[Prince:]
I'm into my 5th soul now so that makes me three hundred

[Vanessa:]
Why do you pretend to be amazed?

[Prince:]
And twenty
I'm amazed at your beauty
I saw you on television

[Vanessa:]
320 hmm, don't sweat it honey, I'm too young for you
Although rumor has it that the crown princess of Cairo
Is now a member of the NPG
Are you there?

[Prince:]
Ahem

[Vanessa:]
Do you know that the princess is 16 years old?
How 'bout this for a story: "320 year old robs the cradle"
What a scandal

[Prince:]
Scandal

[Vanessa:]
You know, if you don't give me the real story
I'll have to make one up of my own
So why don't you tell me the truth - the truth - the truth
Why don't you tell me the truth?
