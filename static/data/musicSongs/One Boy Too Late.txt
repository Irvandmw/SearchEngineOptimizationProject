Song Name: One Boy Too Late
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Tell her you need her
Tell her you love her
Don't let another say
The words you should have said
Or you'll be

One boy to late to hold her tight
One boy to late to hold everynight
And kiss her in the moonlight
One boy to late for happiness
One boy who'll never hear her answer yes
And never know her sweet caress

Tell her you need her
Tell her you love her
Don't let another say
The words you should have said
Or you'll be

One boy to late and lonely too
One boy who didn't whisper I love you
So tell her now, tell her now
Tell her now
Before I do

So tell her now, tell her now
Tell her now
Before I do
