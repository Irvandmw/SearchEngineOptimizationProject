Lyrics:


I know what girls like, I know what they want 
I know what girls like, so Iâmma give it to âem! 
Chris, I got you! 

[Lil Wayne]
OK! Weezy F. Baby Polo horses on my underwear 
Baby, Iâm a beast and your boyfriend a gummy bear 
Well can I at least put some kisses on you under there 
Man, it ainât my fault, I want you badder than some fucking air
Hundred millionaire, I take you anywhere 
I put a ring on it, and make you really care 
Now whatâs really good, itâs young mula baby 
Yeah! Guns, and roses and tulips, baby! 
I do this baby, now come and do it with me 
Because Iâm right, Iâm right, like a new amendment  
Now Iâm right with your ass 
And if you fall in love after tonight, itâs your bad! 

[Chris Brown]
She like it over here, she like it the way I do it 
She want to lick lick, so I put it on to it 
(I know what you girl like, I know what you girl want 
I know what you girl like!) 
She says she like a boss, call her Lil CeeLo 
Well shawty like a boss, so I let her swipe the Visa 
(I know what you girl like, I know what you girl want 
I know what you girl like!) 
And I hear she got a man at home 
But when he calls she donât pick up the phone 
Cause he donât give her what I do 
So Iâm asking you! 

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do? 
She wanna make me her boo 
She wanna say never go 
So Iâm letting you know! 
I know what you girls like, 
I know what you girls want 
I know what you girls like 
And Iâm the only one to make you say oh, oh, oh 
Iâm just letting you know oh, oh, oh 

[Chorus]
I know what you girls like 
I know what they want 
I know what girls like 
And Iâm the only one to say oh, oh, oh 
I know what you girls like, 
I know what they want 
I know what girls like 
And Iâm the only one to make you say oh, oh, oh 

[Chris Brown]
She like to get frisky every time she see me 
And she canât pronounce her name cause her lips are shaking 
(I know what you girl like, I know what you girl want 
I know what you girl like!) 
She stands up and down, canât get enough of it 
She can break it down every time we dancing
(I know what you girl like, I know what you girl want 
I know what you girl like!) 
And I hear she got a man at home 
But when he calls she donât pick up the phone 
Cause he donât give her what I do 
So Iâm asking you! 

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do? (Yeah)
She wanna make me her boo 
(She wanna make me her boo) 
She wanna say never go (never go)
So Iâm letting you know oh, oh, oh 
I know what you girl like, 
I know what you girl want 
I know what you girl like
And Iâm the only one to say oh, oh, oh 
Iâm letting you know oh, oh, oh 

[Chorus]
I know what you girls like 
I know what they want 
I know what girls like 
And Iâm the only one to say oh, oh, oh 
I know what you girls like, 
I know what they want 
I know what girls like 

[Chris Brown]
Only try to keep it real 
I keep telling her to chill 
I canât keep her off my dick 
So what you want me to do about it? 
You canât blame her for getting what she needs
And I canât deny it what sheâs asking of me 
Hey, cause I know what she wants 
So tell me what you gonna do about it! 

What you gonna do, hey? (you gonna do)
She wanna make me her boo 
She wanna say never go 
So Iâm letting you know 

[Chorus]
I know what you girls like 
I know what you girls want 
I know what you girls like 
And Iâm the only one to say oh, oh, oh 
Iâm just letting you know 
I know what girls like, I know what they want 
I know what girls like
And Iâm the only one to make us say oh 
I know what you girl like 
I know what you girl want 
I know what you girl like
