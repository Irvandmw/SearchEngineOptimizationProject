Lyrics:


You don't have to buy me all the gold there is in Rome
Don't have to surprise me with the most expensive home
Don't have to travel round the world for me at all
Baby, the way you smile at me is self explainable

Oh, baby, baby, baby, I don't want much
Just say you love me now and then
And mean it is more than enough

It's just the little things, the simple little things, babe
I know it may sound funny but
Sometimes they mean so much to me
Makes me feel secure and puts my soul at ease
Baby, the little things are things that matter to me

Hey oh, babe
Oh yeah, baby
Yeah, darlin'

Oh, you don't have to be a movie star on the TV, no, baby
Don't have to be a knight in shining armor to rescue me, no
Don't have to promise me the moon and stars above, darlin'
Just keep showin' your there for me, it keeps me in love

Oh, baby, baby, baby, I don't want much
Just say you love me now and then
And mean it is more than enough

It's just the little things, the simple little things, babe
I know it may sound funny but
Sometimes they mean so much to me
Makes me feel secure and puts my mind at ease
Baby, the little things are things that matter to me

You don't have to go out of your way, baby
Just say, that love will always stay, darlin'
Oh, baby, I don't really want much
'Cause if you really love me, baby, hey
That's more than enough

It's just the little things, the simple little things, babe
I know it may sound funny but
Sometimes they mean so much to me
Makes me feel secure and puts my mind at ease
Baby, the little things are things that matter
Little things are things that matter, things that matter
Oh, little things are things that matter to me, hey
