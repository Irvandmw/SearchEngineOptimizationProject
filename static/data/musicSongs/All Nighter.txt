Lyrics:


Let me break it to you boy
I can give it to you all night
On and on we pullin' all nighters
We ain't gotta turn on them lights

We up till the day break off
Makeup, wanna take take off
No sleep, you my sunshine though
Just me you and some wine
Cuz we tryna unwind
We sleep maybe sometime
Yeah we got the same schedule, sexual
Drive speed so I just let you
Spend fifteen on it and that's fine
Cuz we already been around five
Lil weed, hennessy kinda sound nice
Finna need blue sheets lay around night
Feeling weak in the knees, make it bounce like blap blap blap
Bed smack to the wall, tap tap tap
Wait let me throw it all back back back
Neighbor banging on the door

Ain't no sleeping, fuck Monday
It's a weekend til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight
He like that t-shirt no undies
Ain't no sleeping, fuck Monday
It's a weekend til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight
He love that t-shirt no undies

Let me break it to you boy
I can give it to you all night
On and on we pullin' all nighters
We ain't gotta turn on them lights
