Bitches...

Look I'm, I'm, I'm
Bruh, ah
Busty, must be genes
Man, I'm lucky
Collard greens
Yams, I'm yummy
If I see ya man I'm bussin', bussin', bussin'
Cause I'm bruh, uh
Bustin', bustin', bussin' off

Poppin' off my blouse
Poppin' off my blouse
Jeans just ripped
Bottons poppin' off my blouse
Poppin' off my blouse
Poppin' off my blouse
Jeans just ripped
Bottons poppin' off my blouse

The booty said don't trust me
She just got some money
She just got her Tummy Tuck
Look mom a money flood
Only thing that's ugly
Is them hoes who talk funny
I ain't really said nothing
I just show 'em how it's done-y
Mix my whip cream and caramel
With that syrup and that honey
That big thing go slam
Said this bitch need no heels
Got him licking on his lips
I'm lookin' like Hickory Smoke Ham
With my thick thighs and no Tummy
Shake that maker of that money

Look I'm, I'm, I'm
Bruh, ah
Busty, must be genes
Man, I'm lucky
Collard greens
Yams, I'm yummy
If I see ya man I'm bussin', bussin', bussin'
Cause I'm bruh, uh
Bustin', bustin', bussin' off

I can't take my dress off cause my titties still big, uh
She just wanna scissor
Tongue out like a lizard
I just made that nigga disappear
I'm like a wizard
I just got my hair done and I'm feeling like Sza
I ain't won the lotto, I am just a winner
If she is a snack then I'm a candle lit dinner
Think I got him shooken watch him fidget like a spinner
I been gettin' thinner and thinner and thicker

Look I'm, I'm, I'm
Bruh, ah
Busty, must be genes
Man, I'm lucky
Collard greens
Yams, I'm yummy
If I see ya man I'm bussin', bussin', bussin'
Cause I'm bruh, uh
Bustin', bustin', bussin' off

Poppin' off my blouse
Poppin' off my blouse
Jeans just ripped
Bottons poppin' off my blouse
Poppin' off my blouse
Poppin' off my blouse
Jeans just ripped
Bottons poppin' off my blouse
