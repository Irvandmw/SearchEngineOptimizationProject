Lyrics:


[Nick:]
Frost grows outside the window
First kiss under the mistletoe
Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Bells chime inside a steeple
Open the doors see the people sing
Oh Oh, Oh Oh
[Kevin:]
And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa's back in town, town, town
That's when it's Christmas time again

[All:]
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
[Brian:]
I've been checking my list twice
Got plans to give you your gift tonight
Oh Oh, Oh Oh

[AJ:]
Wake up under a lit tree
One wish came true you're here with me
Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Yeah
[All:]
And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa's back in town, town, town

[AJ:]
That's when it's Christmas time again

[All:]
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
[Howie:]
And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa's back in town, town, town
That's when it's Christmas time again
[AJ:] Again!
[All:]
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
[Nick:]
I give you, I give you my heart
Yeah, it's Christmas

[All:]
Ta ta ta ta, it's Christmas time again!
Ta ta ta ta, it's Christmas time again!

[Nick:]
I've been back
I've been good
I've been everything I should
[All:]
Ta ta ta ta, it's Christmas time again!
Ta ta ta ta, it's Christmas time again!
[Nick:]
I've been back
I've been good
And you know that I do what I should!

[All:]
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
