Lyrics:


Hold on for a second, if words can be weapons
Then what I say can effect it, they're not just words on a record
And I can choose to respect it, or choose to infect it
But once it hits the water, it's too late to be selective

'Cause one voice is enough to make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up and watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark, one faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart before it all falls apart

So stand up, shout it out, and put 'em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let's make it count, it's a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out, sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out
And before we depart, let's leave a mark 'cause light shines brighter in the dark

When we scream, our lips don't make a sound
We march, with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go, on this untraveled road

So hold on for a moment, if we're not scared of opponents
Then with what we have we can own it, we'll just plant the seed and keep growin' it
And when that light shines in the mornin', they'll still be waken' up yawning
But we'll be smilin' like we expected, with sweet victory one method

'Cause one voice is enough to make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up and watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark, one faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart before it all falls apart

So stand up, shout it out, and put 'em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let's make it count, it's a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out, sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out
Before we depart, let's leave a mark 'cause light shines brighter in the dark

When we scream, our lips don't make a sound
We march, with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go, on this untraveled road

When we scream, our lips don't make a sound
We march, with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go, on this untraveled road

And I can choose to respect it, or choose to infect it
But once it hits the water, it's too late to be selective
'Cause one voice is enough to make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up and watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark, one faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart before it all falls apart

When we scream, our lips don't make a sound
We march, with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go, on this untraveled road

When we scream, our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go, on this untraveled road
On this untraveled road
On this untraveled road
