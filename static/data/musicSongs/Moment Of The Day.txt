Lyrics:


The hurt is washed away, but still here I am,
In the middle of it all, with heavy hands,
And I try so hard, yea, just to leave behind me,
All the chains that bind me.

I won't back down, won't turn my head around,
Quick, take a recess, oops, take another breath,
Guess who, who's you, better take another crew,
Find out, all about, just don't doubt, just don't doubt

[Chorus]
And I won't be lost in these watered down dreams,
That surround me, I won't be caught up in the moment of the day, yea [2x]

Alright

[repeat verses]

Come on

[Chorus]
