Lyrics:


You don't know my struggle
You don't know my struggle
You don't know my hustle
You don't know my hustle
Step out done try me had to show my muscle
Fuck nigga don't trust em
Fuck nigga don't trust em, yeah
It's that baby boy shit

It's that baby boy, that baby boy
That baby boy shit
It's that baby boy shit
It's that baby boy shit
It's that baby boy, that baby boy
That baby boy shit
Yeah, yeah

Sixteen on my own, young nigga being broke
[?] tryna had to rob niggas
Cause I ain't even have a phone
I'm just tryna be a man, got me feeling all alone
Ain't nobody show the right side
So I had to go and do some wrong
You don't know my struggle, niggas tryna eat
Damn time run before a week
Nigga barely even had a sheet
Boy I wasn't rocking no designers
Had the same Jordans on my feet
I was talking bout being a rich nigga
With both meal to eat yeah
Swear to God they love to hate
They'll say it to your face
They just wanna see you fall off
They ain't tryna see you get the cake
I remember I was starving
Fake twenties had to bus' em
I was swerving got the lean on me
Had to stretch it out and roll a [?]

You don't know my struggle
You don't know my struggle
You don't know my hustle
You don't know my hustle
Step out done try me had to show my muscle
Fuck nigga don't trust em
Fuck nigga don't trust em, yeah
It's that baby boy shit
It's that baby boy shit
It's that baby boy, that baby boy
That baby boy shit
It's that baby boy shit
It's that baby boy shit
It's that baby boy, that baby boy
That baby boy shit
Yeah, yeah

Ricch nigga that's the stage name
Yesterday I was just riding broke
Put the [?] four back to bay [?]
Robbing niggas and selling the dope
Back in high shool I was fucked up
I'm like how I'm gon pay for the bus
So at night time I has hittin late to pay the phone bill for the month
Yeah steal all the time for a nigga
Go on take the top bunk
Streets know I'm a lil nigga
But I ain't never been a punk
Most time I was on a flow
Using coke for a pedal
To a five star hotel one day it gon fill
Now it's back to the flow
Up and down got me seasick
Hope God look out or me
One day I'm a walk [?]
Getting prayed up
Forgive me for the way I came up

You don't know my struggle
You don't know my struggle
You don't know my hustle
You don't know my hustle
Step out done try me had to show my muscle
Fuck nigga don't trust you
Fuck nigga don't trust you, no
It's that baby boy shit
It's that baby boy shit
It's that baby boy, that baby boy
That baby boy shit
It's that baby boy shit
It's that baby boy shit
Fuck nigga don't trust you no, no, no...

Aye, aye
And it [?] motherfucker
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
