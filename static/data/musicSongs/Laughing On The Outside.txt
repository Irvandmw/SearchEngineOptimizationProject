Song Name: Laughing On The Outside
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The crowd sees me out dancing
Carefree and romancing
Oh, Iâm happy with my someone new
Iâm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
âCause Iâm still in love with you

They see me night and daytime
Oh, Iâm having such a gay time
But they donât know what I go through
Iâm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
âCause Iâm still in love with you

No one knows itâs just a pose
Pretending Iâm glad weâre apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry
Oh, but the tears are in my heart

So darling, canât we make up?
Ever, ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do
Iâm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
âCause Iâm still in love with you

Iâm still laughing on the outside
But everyday Iâm crying on the inside
Because Iâm still, still in love with you
