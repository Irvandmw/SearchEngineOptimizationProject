Lyrics:


Where you gone, honey
You got the flow
So why would you wanna to be leaving
Think again, honey
It's not the end
The loving that you've been receiving

Don't you know
you've got it
Don't you know
I want it
Don't you know
I'm begging for more
Can't believe
What I'm seeing
Can't you see what I'm feeling
Tonight is our night girl for sure, for sure

[Chorus]
Everybody there's a party going on right here
Anyone who's anybody is getting down (oh yeah)
We got the music grooving and the girls are moving everywhere
Shaking their hips, licking their lips
Baby I can almost taste it (taste it)

The night is young
But we don't have long
So tell me is it your place or mine
Girl turn off the phone, now I've got you here alone
I want to have you to myself, don't want to hear from no-one else

Don't you know
I got it
Don't you know
You want it
Tonight is our night girl for sure, for sure

[Chorus]
Everybody there's a party going on right here (oh yeah)
Anyone who's anybody is getting down (down oh yeah)
We got the music grooving and the girls are moving everywhere
Shaking their hips, licking their lips
Baby I can almost taste it

Baby baby won't you just face it
Don't you think it's time that we got naked
Look into my eyes
I ain't faking, I ain't faking

Right before your eyes
You got me hypnotized
You better move your.... Shake your....
Taste It

[Chrous]
Everybody there's a party going on right here (on right here)
Anyone who's anybody is getting down (down oh yeah)
We got the music grooving and the girls are moving everywhere (everywhere)
Shaking their hips, licking their lips
Baby I can almost taste it

Everybody there's a party going on right here
(I can almost taste it baby, taste it, oh yeah)
Anyone who's anybody is getting down (oh yeah)
We got the music grooving and the girls are moving everywhere (everywhere)
Shaking their hips, licking their lips
I can almost taste it,
Everybody there's a party going on right here
Anyone who's anybody is getting down (oh yeah)
We got the music grooving and the girls are moving everywhere
Shaking their hips, licking their lips
Baby I can almost taste it
