Lyrics:


Get on with your livin' and I'll get on with mine
No one promise you sunshine all of the time
Get on with your livin' and I'll get on with mine
No one listens to losers or wipes those tears away

'Cause it's one step forward and two steps back most of the time
But no one said it was easy a life goes on without rain
So get on with your livin' and I'll get on with mine
Don't be feelin' you're over no one gets the blame
(Get on with your livin') and I'll get on with mine

Get on with your livin' and I'll get on with mine
No one promise you sunshine all of the time
Get on with your livin' and I'll get on with mine
No one listens to losers someone's got to pay

'Cause it's one step forward...
Get on with your livin' and I'll get on with mine
Get on with your livin' and I'll get on with mine
