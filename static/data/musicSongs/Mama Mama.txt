Lyrics:


I can feel the magic
Suddenly it's all around
I can see it clearly
I can even hear the sound
It's all so new to me
I'm not the same
If this is love - it's words i feel
Then you're to blame - but can't explain
Mama mama when you look at me
I see love in your eyes
Mama mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes
You are all I live for
Maybe that's enough to say
And you're the one I wrote this song for
Everywhere & everyway
