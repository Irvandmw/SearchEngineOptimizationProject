Lyrics:


Shadows are fallin' all over town
Another night and these blues got me down
Oh, misery! I sure could use some company
Ooh, sing it, girl!

Since you been gone I ain't been the same
I carry the weight like an old ball and chain
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause such misery

Oh, misery! Oh, misery!
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause me misery

And, oh! I've been down this road before
With a passion that turned into pain
And each time I saw love walk out the door
I swore I'd never get caught again

But ain't it true? It takes what it takes
And sometime we get too smart to leave
One more heartache for me
Another night in misery

Oh! And, oh, misery! Oh, misery!
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me?
Oh, misery! Oh, misery!
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why does this heart make a fool of me?
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause misery

Misery
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause me misery
Oh, no, yeah
Misery
