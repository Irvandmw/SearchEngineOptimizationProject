Lyrics:


My fingers hold an old love letter
written in your hand
sent to myself, sent to myself
I read it now and I feel better and when I can stand
I'll drink to your health, drink to your health
you say that it's a scrap of paper dated way back when
but you meant it then, you meant it then

My fingers hold an old love letter
written in your hand
sent to myself, sent to myself
I read it now and I feel better and when I can stand
I'll drink to your health, drink to your health
you say that it's a scrap of paper dated way back when
but you meant it then, you meant it then

I meant it too cause it was true
tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong
tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong
tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong

My memory holds another letter, written in my hand
sent to yourself, this was sent to yourself
you tore it to a hundred pieces and I understand
cause I was bad for your health, bad for your health
I'll never write another letter, I won't get hurt again
But I meant it then, I meant it then
