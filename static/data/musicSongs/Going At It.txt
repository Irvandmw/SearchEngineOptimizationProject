Lyrics:


D.A. got that dope

Said I tried to, to spend a day without you
And it's hard to do, I can't do it
Maybe it's the things you do, you do
Huh, it make a nigga go crazy, guess I'm addicted to you, fuck

And I don't, I don't wanna keep lying
I need a little you and me time
I wanna lick you, ooh, pussy keep crying
And the neighbors telling us to keep quiet

Girl, just let go and let this happen (Oh)
Close your eyes, feel my magic stick (Yeah)
We keep fucking up these mattresses
And my back got all these scratches
Rough sex we'll be practicing
Love when we goin' at it

With all that ass, you better shake something
You better take off your clothes before I get mad
I need one on one (One on one)
Quality time, we bump and grinding
Girl, let me see something
You know that I ain't gon' hold back
Don't tease me, woman
Don't keep it from me, just please me, woman

I don't wanna keep lying (I don't)
I need a little you and me time (Me time)
I wanna lick you, ooh, pussy keep crying (Woo)
And the neighbors telling us to keep quiet

Girl, just let go and let this happen (Yeah, yeah)
Close your eyes (Your eyes), feel my magic stick
We keep fucking up these mattresses
And my back got all these scratches (Yeah, yeah)
Rough sex when we practicing
Love when we going at it (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, just let go and let this happen
Close your eyes, feel my magic stick
We keep fucking up these mattresses
And my back got all these scratches
Rough sex when we practicing
Love when we goin' at it
Girl, just let go and let this happen
Close your eyes, feel my magic stick
We keep fucking up these mattresses
And my back got all these scratches
Rough sex when we practicing
Love when we goin' at it
