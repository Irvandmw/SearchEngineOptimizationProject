Ooh
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good

Ooh
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love

Ooh
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love
I feel love

Ooh
Fallin' free, fallin' free
Fallin' free, fallin' free
Fallin' free

Ooh
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me

Ooh
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love
I feel love
