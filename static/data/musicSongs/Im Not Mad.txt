Lyrics:


I'm not even mad anymore
Oh really I ain't even mad anymore
Yeah I don't even want you back anymore
I don't remember what we had anymore, yeah

I hope your back aches and your knees hurt
I hope you think about me sleeping in your t-shirt
I hope your little brother turns out to be nothing like you
I hope that you hurt more than I do

And honestly I still wish you nothing but the best
I know that you're still self-obsessed
I hear the wicked get no rest
But when you do I hope you'll dream of me

You know, you know I'm hoping
Yeah, I hope you dream of me
You know, you know I'm hoping
I hope you dream of me
You know, you know I'm hoping
I hope you dream of me
Yeah.

I don't even hope you die these days
I hope you live 'til eighty-five these days
Regretting that you'd ever lie these days
I hope it's eating you alive these days
Yeah, I hope you're ugly in the bathroom
Just wishing Imma change my mind and come back soon
I hope that when you're thirty-five years
You wish that you tried to 'cause I know that I'd do.

And honestly I still wish you nothing but the best
I know that you're still self-obsessed
I hear the wicked get no rest
But when you do I hope you'll dream of me

Yeah, I hope you dream of me
Yeah, I hope you dream of me
Yeah, I hope you dream of me

I ain't even mad about it anymore
No really, I ain't even mad about it anymore
Maybe just a little less than I was before
I've got a twenty dollar bill that says that you never ever ever gonna change

I still wish you nothing but the best
I know that you're still self-obsessed
I hear the wicked get no rest
But when you do I hope you'll dream of me

I still wish you nothing but the best
I know that you're still self-obsessed
I hear the wicked get no rest
But when you do I hope you'll dream of me

You know, you know I'm hoping
Yeah, I hope you dream of me
You know, you know I'm hoping
Yeah, I hope you dream of me
You know, you know I'm hoping
Yeah, I hope you dream of me
Yeah,
