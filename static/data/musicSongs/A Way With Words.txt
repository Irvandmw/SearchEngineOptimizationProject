Lyrics:


The sentence I threw up
Into a paper cup
Was such a sickly pup
When it died

I'd tried and failed to muster
The words to bring some lustre
To thoughts that now we're dust-er
So I sighed

Well a way with words
Is something to which I would aspire
Though a way with words
Is usually the first sign of a liar

The captivating calls
The verbal golden balls
The memory recalls
With alarm

How as you peeled the bandage
From round the easy language
You really saw the damage
Done by charm

Well a way with words
Is something to which I would aspire
Though a way with words
Is usually the first sign of a liar

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, ooh

The sentence I threw up
Into a paper cup
Was such a sickly pup
When it died

I'd tried and failed to muster
The words to bring some lustre
To thoughts that now we're dust-er
So I sighed

Well a way with words
Is something to which I would aspire
Though a way with words
Is usually the first sign of a liar

Yes a way with words
Is something to which I would aspire
Though a way with words
Is usually the first sign of a liar
Liar, liar, liar
