Lyrics:


Raindrops keep fallin' on my head, 
An' just like the guy who's feet are too big for his bed, 
Nothin' seems to fit, 
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, 
They keep fallin'... 

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun, 
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done, 
Sleepin' on the job,  
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, 
They keep fallin'... 

But there's one thing, I know, 
The blues they send to meet me, 
Won't defeat me, 
It won't be long 'till happiness  
Steps up to greet me... 

[instrumental bridge]

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head, 
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red, 
Cryin's not for me, 
'Cause, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin' 
Because I'm free  
Nothin's worryin' me 
Nothin's worryin' me... 

But there's one thing, I know, 
The blues they send to meet me, 
Won't defeat me, 
It won't be long 'till happiness  
Steps up to greet me... 

...one two three four   
five six seven eight... 

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head, 
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red, 
Cryin's not for me, 
'Cause, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin' 
Because I'm free  
Nothin's worryin' me 
Nothin's worryin' me...
