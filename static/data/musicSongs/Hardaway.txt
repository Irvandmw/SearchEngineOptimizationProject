Lyrics:


I ain't ask nan' nigga for shit
Nigga holding out they hand like a bitch
Nigga blowing up my phone like a ho
Before I give to you, I'll give to my kids
I trust 'em and they took it back from me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm looking like damn, what happened?
I thought we was family (Yeah)
I thought it was ride or die
Nigga touch you, it's homicide
You know that's bottom line (Yeah)
You know what's going on, I got that iron (Yeah)
So run up on me if you wanna die (Yeah)
'Cause I got murder all up on my mind (Yeah)
I been up 'cause I can't get no sleep
Ain't seen my baby girl in 'bout a week
You think I give a fuck about a freak?
My whole motherfuckin' family gotta eat, yeah
She keep it waitin', she flexin', boy
I put her legs by her head like a wrestler (Wreck)
I told her a nigga been stressin'
I usually don't test, but today I was textin' her (Yeah, yeah)
I told her I got some confessions
I did so much dirt I know the devil love me
And I been runnin' from the karma
That's why it's on me and it's loaded
Slidin' on 'em, I'm a poet
The way I paint the picture with my words
Make 'em ride to it and they know it
That's why I gotta keep it goin'
I'm not foldin' under pressure
I'm the crime when it's crunch time
Nigga play with me and then it's lunch time
I ain't talkin' 'bout no fuckin' punchline, like oh
I ain't ask nan' nigga for shit
Nigga holding out they hand like a bitch
Nigga blowing up my phone like a ho
Before I give to you, I'll give to my kids
I trust 'em and they turned their back on me, like damn
Cancer got my mama in the hospital, I ain't there to hold her hand
'Cause I been busy on the road
Actin' like I'm happy smilin' in my videos, steady doin' shows
But don't nobody really know
The shit been fuckin' with my soul
I need a drink in the club
Takin' it out on the people I love
I'm just a thug that's in need of some love, yeah yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy yeah
