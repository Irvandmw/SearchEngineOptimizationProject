Lyrics:


Ay yeah, la la la la la, la la la la la la

La da da da da here I go again, with another love song that I wasted
Just another love run out of patience, she don't want it, she don't need it
Every other word coming from my pen, she throw back in my face, saying where you been
I sound so poetic but it feels like I let it slip away, slip away

I wanna show my love is strong, make her feel it when I'm home
Don't fake it, no mistaking, she can feel me when I'm gone

And actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
And melodies they carry on
Actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
I've been doing it all wrong

La da da da da here we go again, just a couple of friends with some benefits
She gave me all of her love that I wasted, I wrote a new song, then erased it
Oh every other thing that I've said before, said you don't wanna hear about it anymore
I feel so creative but it feels like there's nothing left to say to make you stay

I wanna show my love is strong, make her feel it when I'm home
Don't fake it no mistaking, she can feel it when I'm gone

And actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
And melodies they carry on
Actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
I've been doing it all wrong

La da da da da da da da away, la da da da da da da da da all day
She don't wanna hear, don't wanna hear a word I say, a word I say
La da da da da da da da away, la da da da da da da da da all day
She don't wanna hear, don't wanna hear a word I say, a word I say

Actions speak louder than love songs, speak louder than love songs
The melodies they carry on
Actions speak louder than love, speak louder than love songs
I've been doing it all wrong
