Lyrics:


Oh yeah!
Mmmm-mmm

Something's the matter baby, I'm going insane
Something inside of me keeps talkin' to my brain
Why can't I stop this satanic lust?
I know I shouldn't hold you, but my body says I must

I'm possessed, ooh
And I don't know what to do
Ooh, I'm possessed, yes, ooh
I'm stone crazy in love with you

Something's the matter baby, you're all I see
Your voice is all I hear beggin' to me
I wish I didn't need you, wish I didn't care
I've got to make some love to you cuz it much too much to bare

I'm possessed, yes I am
And I don't know what to do
Ooh, I'm possessed, oh
I'm stone crazy in love with you
[x2]

I'm possessed
Don't know what to do
I'm possessed
I'm stone crazy, ooh

Something's the matter baby, my mind's in a daze
I'm trippin' on your love, it's so hard for me to lay
Can't stop this yearnin', Lord knows I've tried
Free me from dispair, I'm much too young to die

I'm possessed, ooh
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm possessed, ooh (I'm)
I'm stone crazy in love with you
[x2]

I'm possessed, ooh (Yes I am)
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm possessed, yeah!
I'm stone crazy in love with you, ooh
Yeah ooh
Yeah ooh
Yeah ooh
Yeah!

Possessed
Stoned up, up in the head, baby
Said I'm possessed, mmm mmm
All I wanna do is lay you down in my bed
I'm possessed, oh
Yes I am
How's about me not knowin' what to do?
I'm possessed
Yes, oh yeah
I'm, I'm stone crazy in love with you, yeah yeah
Pussy sugar... yeah yeah

Possessed
Well, I'm goin' insane
Hey, I'm possessed
I only wanna do things, baby
Only wanna do things growin' inside a negro's brain, yeah
Yeah yeah..oh oh yeah
You're leaving me no choice
I'm gonna hit you with my guitar, baby

Oh yes
Mmm, oh yes
Bobby Z., step on it
Step on it
Mmm, step on it
Mmm, step on it now
Step down on my head now, baby

Yeah, I'm possessed

Fucked up in my head
I wanna use you in my bed, yeah
I'm possessed
Well, oh
Oh, I got this lust
Baby you know I got this lust, yeah
I don't wanna hold ya
I don't wanna hold ya

But my body says I must!

Oh, oh baby, I must!
Do you mean "yeah"? (Yeah!)
Baby, if I don't
'Cause baby, if I don't
'Cause baby, if I don't
You know your pussy puts up quite an awful fuss
Yes it does
Puts up a fuss, yeah
You know what that means
You're gonna get wet
Pussy get wet, mmm mmm

Something's the matter baby, I'm goin' insane
Something inside of me keeps talkin' to my brain
Why can't I stop this satanic lust?
I don't wanna hold you but my body says I must

Stone in love with you (Stone in love with you, baby)
Stone in love with you, baby
Stone crazy in love with you, baby
