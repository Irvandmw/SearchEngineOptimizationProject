Lyrics:


It feels like I'm looking at life
Through a telescope because I'm so high
The ground never seemed so far away
Truth shall be told one day
I'll be under ground one day
I've got a woman that'll putt roses on my grave
Roses on my grave
Feels like I'm looking at life
Through a telescope because I'm so high
And the ground never seemed so far away 
Truth shall be told one day
I'll be under ground one day
Don't forget me
Please forgive me
It's my redemption
Time for redemption
I'll see you on the other side
