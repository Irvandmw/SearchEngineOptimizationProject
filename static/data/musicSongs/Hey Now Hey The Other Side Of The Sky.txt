Lyrics:


Hey now hey, hey now hey
You can groom, hold my hands
Pay for where we're going now, wait
Hey now hey, hey now baby hey
There's a certain something in the back of my mind that I've known it
It's what it's said (why don't you tell us, buddy?)
Hey now baby hey
We're gonna be together for a lifetime
And if we fall short to bed
We gave everything we could when we were wet
But couldn't throw it in the head (the head)
All you gotta do is dig that (dig that)

Sweet lemon peppermint
And orange colored dreams have I
Watching the clouds go by
Sailing the seasons on the other side of the sky

Hey now hey (hey)
Hey now, hey now, hey now hey (hey)
Let's play love being all together
That it last forever
Ear what I pray, hey now hey, hey
Oh, hey now baby hey
We'll take a shower in the stars from heaven
Go through love playing seven and eleven
On the other side of the sky
On the other side of the sky
On the other side of the sky (sky)
On the other side of the sky (sky)

On the other, on the other side of the sky
On the other, oh, on the other side of the sky
On the other, oh, on the other side of the sky
Oh yeah (on the other)
On the other side of the sky, on the other

(Ooh, ooh, ooh...)

We'll take a shower in the stars from the heaven
Go through love playing seven and eleven
On the other side of the sky
On the other side of the sky (ooh)

On the other, on the other side of the sky (side of the sky)
On the other, on the other side of the sky (side of the sky)
On the other, on the other side of the sky (side of the sky)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, on the other side of the sky (side of the sky)
I wonder what's going on, on the other side of the sky (side of the sky)
Come on, come on, come on with me through the other side of the sky (side of the sky)
Oh, oh, oh Lord, the other side (side of the sky)
Oh, oh, oh, the other side of the sky (side of the sky)
Why don't you come to see truth? Why don't you come to truth? (side of the sky)
Come on, come on, come with me, come on, come with me (side of the sky)
I'm on my way, yes I am, ooh (side of the sky)
