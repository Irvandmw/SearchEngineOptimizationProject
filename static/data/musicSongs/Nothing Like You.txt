Lyrics:


I've been living in circles
Each day feels the same
Trying to find my way
I've been tripping on hurdles
Got me so confused
I need to get over you

Trying to convince myself
I don't need help
And I'm still bulletproof
I've been put a part inside
I can't lie
It's time to tell the truth

When you're hurting someone else
You're fooling to yourself
Nothing like you
Nothing like you
Try my hardest to move on
But with her, it feels so wrong
Nothing like you
Nothing like you

Put my cards on the table
Time to show and prove
Just what I'd do for you
Who knew love was so fatal?
Only count the cards
When you know you're lost

Trying to convince myself
I don't need help
And I'm still bulletproof
I've been put a part inside
I can't lie
It's time to tell the truth

When you're hurting someone else
You're fooling to yourself
Nothing like you
Nothing like you
Try my hardest to move on
But with her, it feels so wrong
Nothing like you
Nothing like you

I walk around acting like I don't care
But every time I close my eyes, you're still there
Let you go, baby
Can't let you go, baby

When you're hurting someone else
You're fooling to yourself
Nothing like you
Nothing like you
Try my hardest to move on
But with her, it feels so wrong
Nothing like you
Nothing like you

When you're hurting someone else
You're fooling to yourself
Nothing like you
Nothing like you
Try my hardest to move on
But with her, it feels so wrong
Nothing like you
Nothing like you
