Lyrics:


Oh oh-ohhhh
Oh oh-ohhhh
You said Iâm not giving enough
But baby girl Iâm trying so hard to
Keep up, when you fear
That Iâma always leave you lonely
But you see that I want us to last forever
And my heart stays open..
Darling you know it will get better
But you know that shit wonât happen over night
We just gotta give love a try
And when you look beside you
Girl Iâll be there

When it rains down your face
Tell me where do the tears end up
Donât wanna drown in the rivers of your sorrow
And I, I will swim a thousand miles
Just for one minute to see you smile

Iâm treading water
Iâm treading water
Please donât cry cause your drowning me

Oh oh-ohhhh
Oh oh-ohhhh
What do you say?
What do you mean?
That you blame me
Why is it today that you doubted me
That Iâma always leave you lonely
But you see that I want us to last forever
And my heart stays open
Darling you know it will get better
But you know that shit wonât happen over night
We just gotta give love a try
And when you look beside you
Girl Iâll be there

When it rains down your face
Tell me where do the tears end up
Donât wanna drown in the rivers of your sorrow
And I, I will swim a thousand miles
Just for one minute to see you smile

Iâm treading water
Iâm treading water
Please donât cry cause your drowning me

Oh oh-ohhhh
Oh oh-ohhhh
