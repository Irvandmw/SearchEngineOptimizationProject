Lyrics:


Heavy is the head that wears the crown
All the people came to hear him speak from miles around
They hung on every word a song in every sound
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

He touched the sky to light up all the stars
He could snap his fingers and catch lightning in a jar
I am you and you are me and we are who we are
Touch the sky and light up all the stars

All hail the king whose castle's falling down
The paper prince who wears a cardboard crown
Poor man has his money, rich man has his gold
All hail the king whose fortune is his soul

He climbed the clouds to heaven's highest hill
When you get that high the earth below looks just like a blue pill
Gave wind to all his horses and to all his men good will
When he climbed down from heaven's highest hill

All hail the king whose castle's falling down
The paper prince who wears a cardboard crown
Poor man has his money, rich man has his gold
All hail the king whose fortune is his soul

He breathed his last, they laid him in the ground
False prophets spoke of riches and said all hail to us now
The faithful wouldn't listen and they never would bow down
He breathed his last, they laid him in the ground

All hail the king whose castle's falling down
The paper prince who wears a cardboard crown
Poor man has his money, rich man has his gold
All hail the king whose fortune is his soul
