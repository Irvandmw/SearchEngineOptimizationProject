Lyrics:


(Oh, no, no)
Yeah

I don't step out the house, I be workin'
On my 'Gram, on my 'Gram, they be lurkin'
On my own, by myself, soul searchin', soul searchin'
Smoke, burn my lungs
I been on the run just to get close
Used to get crumbs
Now I like my steak well done, for real
Happy I can kneel, I'm a player off the field
I'ma take it if I feel like it is mine, ayy (Ayy)
Them other days, I would pray, there was no hope for me, yeah
Now I see majesty over me, yeah

Remember when they never show me love? Ye-yeah
Remember when they said I'm not enough? Ye-yeah
Now I'm probably flyer than a dove, ye-yeah (Yeah, yeah)

I don't step out the house, I be workin'
On my 'Gram, on my 'Gram, they be lurkin'
On my own, by myself, soul searchin', soul searchin'

Soul searchin', wait
I might hit the interstate, yeah
What if I just took a break? Yeah
At a house all on the lake
I'm from where the lakes are great
I'm from where the people share how they feel
They're not afraid to be here, oh yeah
I might call
I'm from the 734, why do people wanted more?
But

Remember when they never show me love? Ye-yeah
Remember when they said I'm not enough? Ye-yeah
Now I'm probably flyer than a dove, ye-yeah (Yeah, yeah, than a dove)

I don't step out the house, I be workin'
On my 'Gram, on my 'Gram, they be lurkin'
On my own, by myself, soul searchin', soul searchin'
Soul searchin', wait

Aah...
Yeah, than a dove
