Lyrics:


I love the world.
Sometimes it loves me.
The love of my life

Is humanity.
The rich and the poor
The broken and whole
All come together
Feeding the soul
Each one belongs at this feast.

Drink to the pleasures!
Drink for the pains.
Drink for the losses.
Drink to the gains!
The humble the twisted
The proud and the grand

Sinner and sinned against
This is my stand
Each one belongs at this feast.

Come and be at this table
Come and take what is mine to share with you
And if you are able
You must give what is thine to give
Thine to give, forever
We'll be as one solid body together

Drink for the sorrows
Drink to the bliss
Drink to the raptures of Eros Urst kiss
One strong true purpose
No thought of return
No rest or hope of rest
The visions still burn
Each one belongs at this feast.

Come and be at this table
Come and take what is mine to share with you
And if you are able
You must give what is thine to give
Thine to give, forever
We'll be as one solid body together

Come and be at this table
Come and take what is mine to share with you
And if you are able
You must give what is thine to give
Thine to give, forever
We'll be as one solid body together

I love the world.
Sometimes it loves me.
The love of my life,

Is humanity.
