Lyrics:


Every once in awhile I know
And it probably shows
But every time I look into your eyes
I see a world thats changing more and more
I see world I've never seen before
And I know and I know
When I go to sleep at night
I pull the blankets up tight
I dream of times when I can hold you in my arms
And I will look at you and you at me
And we can be together permanently
And I know and I know
And I know that it must be Audrey,
She's the only one for me
And I know and I know
And I know that I must be Audrey
Yeah it must be Audrey
Yeah it must be Audrey 
She's the only one for me
She's the only one for me
She's the only one for me
She's the only one for me
