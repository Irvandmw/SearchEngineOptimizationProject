Lyrics:


You said that when we parted
I'd be blue and broken hearted
I laughed and I told you we were through
Let's talk the whole thing over, baby
Just like we used to do

I've tasted other girls kisses and
I realize what I've been missing and
I understand you found somebody knew
Let's talk the whole thing over, baby,
I can't believe its true

It's been so long since I
Have talked to you
Been so long since
That I've been blue

I'm through with all of this stallin' and
I know that I have fallen and
I hope you're feeling that way too
Let's talk the whole thing over, baby
I'm still in love with
I'll always be in love with
I'm still in love with you

I'm through with all of this stallin' and
I know that I have fallen and
I hope you're feeling that way too
Let's talk the whole thing over, baby
I'm still in love with
I'll always be in love with
I'm still in love with you
