Lyrics:


The way you wear your hat, 
The way you sip your tea, 
The mem'ry of all that, 
No, no! They can't take that away from me! 

The way your smile just beams, 
The way you sing off-key, 
The way you haunt my dreams, 
No, no! They can't take that away from me! 

We may never, never, meet again, 
On the bumpy road to love, 
Still, I'll always, always, keep the mem'ry of... 

The way you you hold your knife, 
The way we danced 'till three, 
The way you changed my life, 
No, no! They can't take that away from me! 
No, they can't take that away from me! 

[instrumental break]

The way you you hold your knife, 
The way we danced 'till three, 
The way you changed my life, 
No, no! They can't take that away from me! 
No, they can't take that away, 
'Cause I think you're here to stay, 
No, they can't take that away... from me!
