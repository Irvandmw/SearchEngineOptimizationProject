Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Told you I just got outta somethin'
You said you just did too
Couldn't drag me back in love for nothin'
Last thing on earth I'd ever do

'Cause it never works
Someone always gets hurt
Why would I ever do that again?

But now I can't even sleep
I'm seventeen in my head
I'm startin' to think
That I just might be obsessed
I am in two steps too deep
A hundred miles too far-gone
How did I catch
What I was runnin' away from
It was the last thing I wanted
Now it's all I want
(Now it's all I want)

I was gonna move on in my own time
Just take a minute for myself
But just one look at you and in no time
I couldn't see anything else

And now I can't even sleep
I'm seventeen in my head
I'm startin' to think
That I just might be obsessed
I am in two steps too deep
A hundred miles too far-gone
How did I catch
What I was runnin' away from
It was the last thing I wanted
Now it's all I want

Yeah, 'cause it never works
Someone always gets hurt
Swore I'd never go through that again, yeah

But now I can't even sleep
I'm seventeen in my head
I'm startin' to think
That I just might be obsessed
I am in two steps too deep
A hundred miles too far-gone
How did I catch
What I was runnin' away from
It was the last thing I wanted
Now it's all I want
(Now it's all I want)
It's all I want
You're all I want
