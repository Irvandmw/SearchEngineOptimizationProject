Lyrics:


Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

What cruel world is this? Nectar of the gods
Heroin gold in my veins, you in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway racing at a million and I just can't stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone, call again, I wanna talk

I get wild on you baby
I get wild and fucking crazy
Like you never knew, ooh, ooh
I get wild on you baby
I get wild and fucking crazy
Like the color blue, ooh, ooh

What sweet world is this? Honey on the vine
School kid dreams came true then passed in the night
I used to dream about people like you now I don't know why
I used to sing about people like you now I just get high

I get wild on you baby
I get wild and fucking crazy
Like you never knew, ooh, ooh
I get wild on you baby
I get wild and fucking crazy
Like the color blue, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I get wild on you baby
I get wild and fucking crazy
Like you never knew, ooh, ooh
I get wild on you baby
I get wild and fucking crazy
Like the color blue, ooh, ooh

Californ-I-A, homeland of the gods
Once I found my way, but now I'm lost
