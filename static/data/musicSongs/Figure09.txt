Lyrics:


[Mike Shinoda:]
Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
It's like nothing I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again

'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize instead of setting it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away
It never goes away

[Chester Bennington:]
And now you've become a part of me
You'll always be right here
You've become a part of me
You'll always be my fear
I can't separate
Myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you

[Mike Shinoda:]
Hearing your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I'd see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them

And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing myself to them and everyday
I regret saying those things 'cause now I see
That I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away
It never goes away

[Chester Bennington:]
And now you've become a part of me
You'll always be right here
You've become a part of me
You'll always be my fear
I can't separate
Myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you

[Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington:]
Never goes away
Never goes away
It never goes away
It never goes away

(Get away from me)
Give me my space back you gotta just (go)
Everything comes down to memories of (you)
I've kept it in but now I'm letting you (know)
I've let you go so get away from (me)
Give me my space back you gotta just (go)
Everything comes down to memories of (you)
I've kept it in but now I'm letting you (know)
I've let you go

[Chester Bennington:]
And now you've become a part of me
You'll always be right here
You've become a part of me
You'll always be my fear
I can't separate
Myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you

I've let myself become you
I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you
