Lyrics:


(I'll keep it in overdrive)
(I'll keep it in overdrive)
(I'll keep it in overdrive)

I got lost in your words tonight
I didn't think it would be alright
Always trying to bring me down
I didn't think I would come around
So yeah I'm taking this all the way
No I'm never gonna stop today
No matter what you do or say
I can take it to overdrive

And if I'm gonna try, I won't need help, no
And if you gotta go, go by yourself

I'm lost with words, I'm lost with words, can't find the words tonight
Cause you try to stop this train I'm on which to me is no surprise
But I'ma keep keep moving on, not gonna stop for your confusion
I'll keep it in, I'll keep it in overdrive

I'll keep it in overdrive

So now I'm back again
You're still pulling down
You think that you've done pretty well
But just look at me now
I got twice more than what you got
And ain't nobody's gonna take my spot
So I'm here to last forever
To take it to overdrive

And if I'm gonna try, I won't need help, no
And if you gotta go, go by yourself

I'm lost with words, I'm lost with words, can't find the words tonight
Cause you try to stop this train I'm on which to me is no surprise
But I'ma keep keep moving on, not gonna stop for your confusion
I'll keep it in, I'll keep it in overdrive

So I'ma keep keep moving
And I'ma keep keep climbing
No matter how hard it gets
And I'ma keep keep trying
Even if I'm dying
I'll take this to overdrive

I'm lost with words, I'm lost with words, can't find the words tonight
Cause you try to stop this train I'm on which to me is no surprise
But I'ma keep keep moving on, not gonna stop for your confusion
I'll keep it in, I'll keep it in overdrive

I'm lost with words, I'm lost with words, can't find the words tonight
Cause you try to stop this train I'm on which to me is no surprise
But I'ma keep keep moving on, not gonna stop for your confusion
I'll keep it in, I'll keep it in overdrive
