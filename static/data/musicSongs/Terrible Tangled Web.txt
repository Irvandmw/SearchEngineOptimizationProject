Lyrics:


You've got a way of makin' me blue
And I've got a way of hurtin' you too.
Oh what terrible tangled web we're we don't we.

You've got a gentleman on your side
And I've got a friend I'm tryin' to hide.
And oh what terrible tangled web we're we don't we.

We both got our way of goin' our way
Knowin' the cost gets greater each day.
And I know you know we know we both
Decieve don't we

We've got our way of livin' in lie
And life's got a way of makin' us cryin'.
Oh what terrible tangled web we're we don't we.

Why'd ve ew have to settle for it
How can we take too much more of it
Figures we both got the nerve to leave don't we.

We've got our way of livin' in lie
And life's got a way of makin' us cryin'.
Oh what terrible tangled web we're we don't we.
Oh what terrible tangled web we're we don't we
