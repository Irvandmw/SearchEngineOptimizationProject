Lyrics:


Innocence, our eyes meet
Pounding chest skips a beat
Suddenly I canât breathe
Two souls collide from 20 feet
A fire ignites and I believe
I believe

I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart beat

Face to face
Loaded grin
Fingertips touching skin
Without a word
Both giving in
Self control is wearing thin
Wondering where this night will end

I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart bâ¦eat yeah
Feel your heart

Speechless, serenity
Tangled blanket
I canât speak
So strongâ¦ so sweetâ¦ so close
I can feel your heart
And I can feel your heart

I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart
I can
I can
I can feel your heart beat
