Lyrics:


(Nigga, we gon' pull up on this bitch like 7 in the morning, nigga, no sleep nigga)
(Still been sippin' all night nigga, damn muddy trip)
(Wheezy outta here)

She give me top in the Tesla
I may invest in the extra
I'm gettin' money, power, hoes, clothes nigga, etc
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I take Perkys to fâight all my demons
It don't help that my bitch is a Devil

Came up in the hallway, servin' jake,
(Yeah, yeah)
Money comin' every way, my bitch'll pay
(Yeah, yeah)
80/20, might not talk, I'm fuckin' her face
(Yeah, yeah)
Man, you trippin', I'm spillin' this sauce
It's drippin' over (Yeah, yeah)

Spend a check on that pussy
I got designer all over my hoodie (What, what)
Yo' nigga ain't real, yo' nigga a pussy (Ugh, look)
Look, there he go
He get a few shots, (Pow) out the Draco

Blue cheese stuck to my jeans (Yeah, yeah)
Double R geeked on lean (Yeah, yeah)
Paped up, lookin' like King (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch pull on my sleeves (Yeah, yeah)
Low socks, Gucci on my feet (Yeah, yeah)
Haven't been to sleep in a week (Yeah, yeah)
Bite down on my teeth
You smell Codeine when I pee (Yeah, yeah)

Sippin' on red lean, gun got a red beam
Know niggas from the red team
They go brazy
Pull up in that new thing
I was fuckin' on a new ting
Bad bitch with a tongue ring

Came up in the hallway, servin' jake,
(Yeah, yeah)
Money comin' every way, my bitch'll pay
(Yeah, yeah)
80/20, might not talk, I'm fuckin' her face
(Yeah, yeah)
Man, you trippin', I'm spillin' this sauce
It's drippin' over (Yeah, yeah)

Pour me a four and another, I love it
Sip, sip, sip, ugh, it's
Me and Hendrix, in the club
Wonderin' if we gon' take your bitch
We already got 5, we was gon' make her 6
I didn't eat today, but I took the Perc
And I pray to God, it won't make me sick

Pour me some 'Tussin, a cup, no rush
Like sip, sip, sip, (Uh-huh)
Ain't got enough fâingers for all these rings
On drip, drip, drip (Uh-huh)
Turn the lil' nigga to fâiends
All they wanna do is bust clips (Uh-huh)
Keep a Mac-11 with a beam
I'm Gucci, don't slip

Gun to your face (Yeah, yeah)
Left, fâlooded out baguettes (Yeah, yeah)

Came up in the hallway, servin' jake,
(Yeah, yeah)
Money comin' every way, my bitch'll pay
(Yeah, yeah)
80/20, might not talk, I'm fuckin' her face
(Yeah, yeah)

She give me top in the Tesla
I may invest in the extra
I'm gettin' money, power, hoes, clothes nigga, etc
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I take Percys to fâight all my demons
It don't help that my bitch is a Devil
