Lyrics:


Twinkle twinkle I'm the star
Who wanted drink? I'm at the bar
My favorite freak, I hit it raw
A lot of reefer, no cigar
I've got a leaf up in the car
No I don't smoke it, I just sell it
Ain't givin' nothing out on credit
So come and see me when you ready
Don't make me rain on your parade
I love my niggas like I'm gay
We go to hell and we don't pray
I'm fresh as hell look at my fade
Bitch can't you tell it I'm the wave
I can pay for your bitch to get off
She keep tellin' me all of your business
I can't wait for that bitch to quit talkin'
I can't wait until my clique start ballin'
Pull up cash out on whatever
Got a new broad and that's my Cinderella
I fuck her friend, she gon probably get jealous
I got the sauce drippin' on some chips
I can't get lost in the sauce, I be pimpin'
Fuck what it cost, I'm a boss, I'm gonna spend it
I'm not fallin' off 'cause I'm 'bout my business
And I'm gettin' money my nigga, ain't got my witness
I used to speak in with my nigga
Was fuckin' around 'bout the bitches
Somebody come home, I can't leave out the door so I jump out the window
Then I started sellin' pounds out the rental car
Pull up tell me what you spendin'
And I'm known for finessin', rob you for your money don't need a pistol
I ran off on the plug cause the drugs he front me way too expensive
Now I go get them racks for a show, and I swear it's a hell of a feelin
Go ask my manager, I don't remember
I'm right back on the road, don't got no time for these hoes, now they yellin' their feelings
And free my cousin dotch
Free my nigga Rell they're both locked up in prison
I pull up with a chauffeur, hop out the suburban just like I'm P Diddy
They let me off on probation and I'm 'bout to go downtown and pick up my pistol
I was fuckin' your hoe on the low, when you see her tell "Baby a miss her"
Used to give me that throat right before she went home to you and let you kiss her
Why you do 'em like that? She be like "Fuck 'em that nigga be trippin'"
Then she wipe up her mouth and I pull my pants, grab my shirt and get missin'
