Lyrics:


(Hey, I'm not here so leave a message)
Met her at our last show.
I know, I know.
It's not a good idea.
I just had to take a chance.
I can't, I can't.
Defend myself against her pretty face.

I get all flustered,
And my heart begins to race.
By the time the night was all through
I gave up my digits to you.

You don't have to play these waiting games.
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm just a guy who's got nothing to do.
If I'm gonna do nothing, I might as well do it with you.

So, it's been a few days.
Okay, okay.
I'm not bullying about it.
But if she doesn't call.
At all, at all.
Then, I guess I'll be spending time alone.
Just because she wouldn't call me on my phone.
So, I'm hoping by the time the night is through,
My line will be tied up by you.

You've got my cellphone number,
But you haven't called
You've got it for a reason
So, if you're teasing me,
Make that call.

You don't have to play these waiting games.
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm just a guy who's got nothing to do.
If I'm gonna do nothing, I might as well do it with you.

You've got my cellphone number,
But you haven't called
You've got it for a reason
So, if you're teasing me,
Make that call.
