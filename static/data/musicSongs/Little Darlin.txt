Lyrics:


Little darlin', little darlin'
Oh where, are you, oo oo oo oo
Walla walla chipa mocka mogga
Oh my lover, oh just for you, only you

My darling, I need you
Darling I need you to call my own
To hold your life, your little foot, your hand
I knew someone would understand that
Hold my hand

My dear, I would run
To find without you
Oo oo oo oo oo
Oh, oo oo oo
That my love was just for you, 'n only you
