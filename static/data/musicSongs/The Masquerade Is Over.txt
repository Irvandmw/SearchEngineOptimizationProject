Lyrics:


Your eyes donât shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
Iâm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

Your kiss donât mean what it used, what it used to mean
It once was inspired, now itâs just another routine
Iâm so afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess Iâll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clownâs disguise
And then Iâll learn to laugh, laugh like Pagliacci, oh, with tears all in my eyes

Hey baby, your kiss donât mean what it used, what it used to mean
It once was inspired, now itâs just an everytime routine
Iâm so afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
