Lyrics:


Ugh, ugh, uh
Ugh, Ooh

Iced out my shit running to the bank now
We still pop them shits don't feel the same now
Kari would flip if he seen how I spend my days now
Only designer shit, run around with cake now
Iced out my shit running to the bank now
We still pop them shits don't feel the same now
Kari would flip if he seen how I spend my days now
Only designer shit, run around with cake now

I told all my niggas we gon' ball in the hills
We was in deep that's why I stack my fuckin' bread
We was rob a nigga, beat a nigga, leave him red
We was 'possed to be here but I took his spot instead
Yesterday had them rockets, but today we holdin' bands
Now all we smoke is pack, you pop them fuckin' xans
And last year he was free but now my brother in the jail
Told him we gon' do it, that's why I'm stickin' to the plan

Iced out my shit running to the bank now
We still pop them shits don't feel the same now
Kari would flip if he seen how I spend my days now
Only designer shit, run around with cake now
Iced out my shit running to the bank now
We still pop them shits don't feel the same now
Kari would flip if he seen how I spend my days now
Only designer shit, run around with cake now

And I drink too much lean I need to stop that
And my nigga hold the beam, better strap that cock back
And we finna check your crib, you better lock that
I was in LA with' the top back
Pull up with a spot, clip like 32
New Patek with' a iced out chain, I got that too
Nigga you coulda been here, that's why I was hurtin' you
Blue strip what I carry I be comin' through

Iced out my shit running to the bank now
We still pop them shits don't feel the same now
Kari would flip if he seen how I spend my days now
Only designer shit, run around with cake now
Iced out my shit running to the bank now
We still pop them shits don't feel the same now
Kari would flip if he seen how I spend my days now
Only designer shit, run around with cake now
