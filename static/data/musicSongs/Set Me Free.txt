Lyrics:


[Verse 1]
Late in the evening 
City sleeping 
All through the night 
This feelingâs creeping on me 
So ready 

Soul is waiting 
Bodyâs aching 
Caught and imprisoned 
My own making 
Iâm so, so ready 
Iâm so gone, come get me 
Wonât you come? 

[Chorus]
Set me free 
Make me yours again 
(Free) 
In your arms again 
(Free) 
Wonât you come and dance with me 

[Verse 2]
Throw out the lifeline 
Iâve been sinking 
Going out of my mind 
Iâve been thinking 
If I could hold her 
Make this storm blow over 

Give me a taste of satisfaction 
Oh, I need to learn her 
I need her faster 
Iâm so wide open 
Wonât you come right over? 
Wonât you come? 

[Chorus]
Set me free 
Make me yours again 
(Free) 
In your arms again 
(Free) 
Wonât you come and dance with me 

[Bridge x2]
Iâve been looking for a light 
Let it shine 
Let it shine 
Youâve been running through my mind 
All this time 
All this time 

[Outro]
Set me free 
Freeâ¦ 
I feel likeâ¦ 
Oh, to be freeâ¦
