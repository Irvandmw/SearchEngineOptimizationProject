Lyrics:


And I am what I am
And I am what I'm not
And I think I'm a good friend to ye
And I'm not a debauched old rouÃ©

Spend some more time with me
And you'll like it a lot
I can bore you with advice
And you can make me feel
That I'm forever young
(Forever young forever young)
I can kid myself that I'm
Forever young

You see the trouble with me
I've got some years on the clock
But the magic in your hands is
Much cheaper than monkey glands is

And you do what you want to do
And you say what you want to say
And everything you do and say is OK

And I am what I am
And I am what I'm not
And I think I'm a good friend to ye
And I'm not debauched old rue

Spend some more time with me
And you'll like it a lot
I can bore you with advice
And you can make me feel
That I'm forever young
(Forever young forever young)
You can make me feel that
I'm forever young
I can kid myself that I'm forever young
Delude myself that I was ever young
Forever young
