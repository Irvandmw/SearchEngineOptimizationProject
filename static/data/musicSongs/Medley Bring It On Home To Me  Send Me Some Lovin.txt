Lyrics:


If you ever,
Change your mind
About leaving,
Leaving me behind
Oh, you better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me
yeah, yeah, yeah

You know I laughed,
Laughed when you left
But now I know,
I only hurt myself
Oh, you better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me
yeah, yeah, yeah, alright

Oh, you better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me,
yeah, yeah, yeah

You know I'll always,
Be your slave
Till I'm dead,
And buried in my grave
Oh, you better bring it me,
Bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me,
yeah, yeah

Send me some loving,
Send it I pray
How can I love you,
When you're so far away

Send me your picture,
Send it my dear
So I can hold it,
And pretend you are near

Send me your kisses,
I can feel your touch
I need you, I need you so bad,
Don't you know I miss you so much

My days are so lonely,
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely,
Just waiting for you
