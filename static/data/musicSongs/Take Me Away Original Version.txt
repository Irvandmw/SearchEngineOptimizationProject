Lyrics:


Don't say "No" to anything
"Yes", "Yes", say "Yes" to everything
Just find a way to get away
(Wanna run away?)
Let's take off our clothes,
And see if anybody notices
Then run away, what d'you say?
(We're not okay.)

Have a little joy
Have a little faith,
Live life
Have a little hope
Have a lot of fun

'Cause you, you, you never know
What fate will throw
To make you stop
I, I, I'm gonna try
To let this life
Pick me up and take me away

Run up to a stranger
Kiss and tell them that you love them
And then walk away
You made their day
(At least you hope you did.)
Stand up in a restaurant
Start dancing on the table
Get kicked out for that behavior
(Oops, I did it again.)

Have a little joy
Have a little faith,
Live life
Have a little hope
Have a lot of fun

'Cause you, you, you never know
What fate will throw
To make you stop
I, I, I'm gonna try
To let this life
Pick me up and take me away

Don't you know that nothing equals nothing
Do anything, do everything, do something
Open up your mouth and let your soul sing

You, you, you never know
What faith will throw
To make you stop

You, you, you never know
What fate will throw
To make you stop
I'm gonna try
To let this life
Pick me up and take me away
