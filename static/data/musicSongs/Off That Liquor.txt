Lyrics:


[Verse 1]
I canât lie girl, you so damn sexy
Them other girls ainât got nothing on ya
Patron mixed with me thatâs your recipe
I ainât gotta say it, Iâll show you
Youâre picture perfect girl donât change a thing
Ainât going nowhere, you got me
So when youâre leaving that party baby
Come right over, we can get it started baby, like

Ohh, if itâs loving that you need, from me
Come close, cause your happiness all that matters to me
Girl I know, Iâma cherish what I have
And I want more than your body
A little more than your body

[Chorus]
If I donât give it to you, you be calling like crazy
And when I break you off, you be calling me baby
I know why you tripping, cause my sex is amazing
Acting cause you faded, gone off that liquor
I just wanna give you my, give you my heart
I just wanna give you my, give you my heart
I just wanna give you my, give you my heart
Acting cause you faded, down off that liquor

[Verse 2]
Girl you talking out the side of your neck
And drinking a little too much
Youâre talking crazy is all on your head
Youâre tipsy and ready for loving
So youâre calling me over
To touching, kiss on your body
Youâre here tonight, but itâs more to you than just that
Well I wonât complain if you throw it back, yeah
If itâs loving that you need, from me
Come close, cause your happiness all that matters to me
Girl I know, Iâma cherish what I have
And I want more than your body
A little more than your body

[Chorus]
If I donât give it to you, you be calling like crazy
And when I break you off, you be calling me baby
I know why you tripping, cause my sex is amazing
Acting cause you faded, gone off that liquor
I just wanna give you my, give you my heart
I just wanna give you my, give you my heart
I just wanna give you my, give you my heart
Acting cause you faded, down off that liquor

[Bridge]
Girl youâre my masterpiece, youâre my heart
Shine like a diamond, beauty so priceless girl
My Valentine, my sweetheart, 
Iâm gonna love you baby, donât worry
And if  youâre ready, Iâma give you my heart
Right now girl, baby come over, so we can make love
Girl this is all yours 

[Chorus]
If I donât give it to you, you be calling like crazy
And when I break you off, you be calling me baby
I know why you tripping, cause my sex is amazing
Acting cause you faded, gone off that liquor
I just wanna give you my, give you my heart
I just wanna give you my, give you my heart
I just wanna give you my, give you my heart
Acting cause you faded, down off that liquor
