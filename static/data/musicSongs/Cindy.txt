Lyrics:


I wish I was a apple hangin' in a tree
And everytime my sweetheart passed
She'd take a bite off me
She told me that she loved me
She called me sugar plum
She threw her arms around me
I thought my time had come
Get along home, Cindy-Cindy
Get along home, Cindy-Cindy
Get along home, Cindy-Cindy
I'll marry you sometime
I wish I had a needle
As fine as I could sew
I'd sew her in my pocket
And down the road I go
Cindy hugged and kissed me
She wrung her hands and cried
Swore I was the prettiest thing
That ever lived or died
Get along home, Cindy-Cindy
Get along home, Cindy-Cindy
Get along home, Cindy-Cindy
I'll marry you sometime
