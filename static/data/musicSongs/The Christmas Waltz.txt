Artist: Frank Sinatra Lyrics
Song Name: The Christmas Waltz
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way, he's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me

It's that time of year when the world falls in love
Ev'ry song you hear seems to say "Merry Christmas,
"May your New Year dreams come true"
And this song of mine in three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing, too

[instrumental-first verse]

(It's that time of year when the world falls in love)
(Ev'ry song you hear seems to say)
"Merry Christmas, may your New Year dreams come true"
And this song of mine in three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing, too
