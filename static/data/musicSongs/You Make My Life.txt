Lyrics:


Thank you, baby
Oh, thank you, baby

Oh, you came in my life
Before you I just existed
My hopes, my hopes and past
And without you I couldn't have lasted

Honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, yes you do, baby
Oh, oh, honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, oh baby

We find a love, find a joy
So many, so many search for
You're mine and I'm yours
Darling, I'm, I'm so thankful

Oh, honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, everyday, everyday, baby
Hey, honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, yes you do, baby, yeah

Thank you, baby, for the sunshine

And if I make you sad
Just let me know because I didn't mean to
No way, no way I'd hurt you
Because my very life, my life depends upon you

Oh, honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, yes you do, baby, yeah
Honey you make my life
You know you make my life complete, every, every time of day

Honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, you're so good to me, baby
Honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, thank you for my sunshine

Honey, you make my life
Oh baby, you make my life complete, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, oh, baby, thank you for the sunshine

Honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, and I love, love you, baby
Honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, I depend on you, baby

Everyday, honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, every, Lord, everyday now
Honey, you make my life
You know you make my life complete, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Honey, you make my life
