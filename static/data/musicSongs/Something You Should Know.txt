Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Drifting back to a time gone by
she was in my life
Now I'm watching her from my car

Someone bought her rollerskates
God am I too late?
Did somebody else take my place?

She's getting closer 
and as I roll the window down
I spoke and then she turned around
And I said:

[Chorus:]
There is something you should know
I could never let you go
because I miss you so
Baby when the time is right
together we will fight
to get you in my life

Looking back through misty eyes
but with a fathers pride
I drive away in my car

It dosn't matter baby
if it takes a year or two
Someday
you're gonna find the truth
And I thought

[Chorus:]
There is something you should know
I could never let you go...
