Lyrics:


I'm a travelin' man
Made a lot of stops all over the world
And in every port I own the heart
Of at least one lovely girl

I've a pretty Seniorita waiting for me
Down in old Mexico
If you're ever in Alaska stop and see
My cute little Eskimo

Oh, my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town
Makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong
Waits for my return

Pretty Polynesian baby, over the sea
I remember the night
When we walked in the sand of Waikiki
And I held you, oh, so tight

[Instrumental Interlude]

Oh, my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town
Makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong
Waits for my return

Pretty Polynesian baby, over the sea
I remember the night
When we walked in the sand of Waikiki
And I held you, oh, so tight

Oh, I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man
Whoa, I'm a travelin' man
