Lyrics:


I've got a monster in my closet
Someone's underneath my bed
The wind's knocking at my window
I'd kill it but it's already dead

It waits till the midnight hour to come
To torture me for the wrong i've done
it just sits there and stares me
And it won't let me get any sleep

[Repeat Hook]

At first I was scared when
I looked at his eyes
But now that I know him I'm not that surprised
I'm just waiting on the sun to rise
Oh how I wish that old sun would rise

[Repeat Hook]

I used to wonder why he looked familiar
Then I realized it was a mirror
And now it is plain to see,
The whole time the monster was me

[Repeat Hook]

Yeah Mmm The living dead
Only thing that could bring it back alive, Woman
Is some good good head
(Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha)
