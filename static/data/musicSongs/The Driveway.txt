Lyrics:


Remember last summer
Under the shooting stars?
We made a wish on together forever
And let nobody tear us apart
And how fun was that ride down to Mexico?
We took a chance on those roadside tacos
And we got sick by the side of the road

And the fall came
And we had that big pot luck party
And your little sixteen year old brother
Spilt wine all over my carpet
And I got mad, you thought it was funny
I stayed mad all winter
It's so sad
A thing like that
Becomes such a splinter

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

I'm almost twenty-three
And I'm barely hanging on
I can't keep crashing couches
And going to sleep at dawn
And when were you going to take me
Somewhere that I can dress up?
Where we can act grown up
Do you ever even wanna clean up?

We share a car, you thought it was okay
You couldn't have cut it closer
I'm sick of it, this is it
And now the party's over

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

Someday, you'll make some girl happy
I know you'll get though
You'll know just what to say to do
Because I showed you

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

Let the credits start to roll
Oh, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah
Oh, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
I guess the driveway will be the end of the road
Will be the end of the road
