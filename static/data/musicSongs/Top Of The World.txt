Lyrics:


On top of the world, we're never coming down
We're taller than giants
(Bruh)
(Can you feel it now?)

I scratch the surface of the truth till my hands bleed
Rub my hands on my face, get my face red
War paint, more pain, I'm a war head
Fake news, fake truth, that was spoon-fed
I'm spinning in my head, can believe nothing
I'm digging to the bottom till I feel something
If you're gonna buy the lie, then you got nothing
Better wave the white flag, there's a storm coming

This is for the dreamers, the believers
Put a noose around the neck of the deceiver
This is for the dreamers, the believers
And we're never gonna stop, till we're dead

On top of the world, we're never coming down
We're taller than giants
On top of the world, they wanna take us down
We're taller than giants

(Uh, wassup?)
(When we feel it kicking, yeah)

Yeah, I'm a broken mad man on a mission
And to question every lie is my addiction
When you steppin' out of line, they call you vicious
If the truth was in the fire, would you jump in and risk it?
Start somethin', say somethin', be somethin', what?
Breathe fire, wildfire, yeah, we fire it up
No, I don't think that I could take any more
No, I don't think that I could take it no more

This is for the dreamers, the believers
Put a noose around the neck of the deceiver
This is for the dreamers, the believers
And we're never gonna stop, till we're dead

On top of the world, we're never coming down
We're taller than giants
On top of the world, they wanna take us down
We're taller than giants

(Oh)
(Oh)

Head up to the sky when you wear the crown
Nobody, no soul that could take you down
Head out to the sky, don't feel the ground
Nobody, no soul that could take you down
(Oh, that could take you down)
(They'll never take you down)
(Down, uh)

On top of the world, we're never coming down
We're taller than giants

On top of the world, we're never coming down
We're taller than giants (Taller than giants)
On top of the world, they wanna take us down
We're taller than giants

We're on top of the world
Top of the world
We're on top of the world
Top of the world
We're on top of the
