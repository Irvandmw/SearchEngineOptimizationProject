Lyrics:


Through heaven and hell
That's what you said
Through sickness and health
That's what you said

Cause no one knows what we been through
That's what you said
And no one knows me like you do
That's what you said
No matter

I coulda waited for someone to come around
For someone who wouldn't leave a bad taste in my mouth
But life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
I pucker my lips, you could be pretty sour
Add sugar and water, just something to wash it down
Cause life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade

For better or worse
That's what you said
From propose to hearse
That's what you said

Cause no one knows what we been through
That's what you said
And no one knows me like you do
That's what you said
No matter

I coulda waited for someone to come around
For someone who wouldn't leave a bad taste in my mouth
But life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
I pucker my lips, you could be pretty sour
Add sugar and water, just something to wash it down
Cause life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade

Nobody's perfect, no
We're tryin' the best we can
And the pain its so often, oh
From the moments like this
When you're holding my hand

And you're kissing all over my shoulders
Down to my thighs
I haven't told you why,
But you don't see who I am inside
Cause you believed and preconceived this love was born again, you're that paranoid, yeah
But paradise is on the table
Just let me show you how sweet this life can be

I coulda waited for someone to come around
For someone who wouldn't leave a bad taste in my mouth
But life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
I pucker my lips, you could be pretty sour
Add sugar and water, just something to wash it down
Cause life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
