Lyrics:


Like that old clock on the wall that keeps ticking night and day
My heart will keep beatin' just for you
Like that old river that flows and keeps rolling out to sea
My love will go on my whole life through.

Like that old sun in the sky seems to hide when clouds come by
And seems brighter when those clouds roll away
Well, I make each day turn out fine just as long as you are mine
With my heart beating for you through it all
Like that old clock on on the wall.

(Like that old clock on the wall that keeps ticking night and day)
(Like that old river that flows and keeps rolling out to sea)

Like that old sun in the sky seems to hide when clouds come by
And seems brighter when those clouds roll away
Well, I make each day turn out fine just as long as you are mine
With my heart beating for you through it all
Like that old clock on on the wall...
