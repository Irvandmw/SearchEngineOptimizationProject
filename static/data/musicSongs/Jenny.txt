Lyrics:


Jenny
Jenny
You know I'm goin' away
And you know my woman's here
Please don't you stray
Watch over her
You can run and bark and play
Your whole life through
And you can chase the cats around
'Cause she loves that too
But if someone comes to cause her harm
Then protect her true
Oh Jenny

Jenny
Jenny
Guard her while I'm gone
Time moves so slow
For someone who's alone
So comfort her
If she's feelin' low
You got to be a card
And if she's fast asleep
Don't you sleep too hard
If someone comes to cause her harm
You got to cut him down
Oh Jenny

Now maybe
It's gonna be alright
Won't have to bite
Won't have to fight
But then again
So sad but true
There's always someone waiting
Just to shit on you

And if she's feeling low
You got to be a card
And if she's fast asleep
Don't you sleep too hard
'Cause if someone comes to cause her harm
You got to cut him down
Oh Jenny

Now maybe
It's gonna be alright
You won't have to bite
Never have to fight
But then again
You know it's sad but true
There's always someone waiting
Just to shit on you
