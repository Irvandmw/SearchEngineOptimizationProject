[Intro:]
D.A. got that dope!

[Chris Brown:]
Sexy, tease me with your lingerie
Water drippin' on me
Do what you want to do
Talk dirty, look me in the eyes and say (What?)
Ooh, fuck me please

Sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy
Fuck me please
Sexy, sexy (Ooh)
Sexy, sexy
Fuck me please

Baby you could live your whole life holding out (Out)
Let me pick you up and see if you could hold it down
Girl I'm sorry 'cause I can't keep my hands to myself
And I'm on lately, my baby, my pants and my belt
Just drips, slaps, I'ma smack that ass
Where would you want it from the front or the back
It don't matter, like it slow, keep going faster
Where I nut on the floor, I-
It's only you and me, stuck with each other and I love it (Oj)
I'ma give my all, can't get rid of me (Yet)
Put you on a plane, whenever you on a jet (Jet)
Snatch your rapper chain, whenever you need a check (Check)
You know you can come and stay when you fight and he upset
Ain't nothing change, side nigga, I remain, I fuck with you 'cause

Sexy, tease me with your lingerie
Water drippin' on me
Do what you want to do
Talk dirty, look me in the eyes and say (What?)
Ooh, fuck me please

Sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy
Fuck me please
Sexy, sexy (Ooh)
Sexy, sexy
Fuck me please

[Trey Songz & Chris Brown:]
I'm going long in the back
Give me that sneak peak of that freaking
Fuck me please
Oh, I'm hard in my pants, give me that hand, girl what you need?
Fuck me please

[Trey Songz:]
Pussy good, pussy splash, yeah, I want some more
Pussy super fantastic, set the bar
All these bitches like to shaking that ass, do it for the bag
But I won't stress baby 'cause

[Chris Brown & Trey Songz:]
Sexy (Sexy), tease me with your lingerie (Don't you leave)
Water drippin' (Oh) on me (Ooh)
Do what you want to do
Talk dirty (To me), look me in the eyes and say (Oh, ooh)
Ooh, fuck me please

[Chris Brown:]
Sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy
Fuck me please
Sexy, sexy (Ooh)
Sexy, sexy
Fuck me please

I remember nights, I was cold, ain't had no sleep
I was boosting bikes, 22 under the freeze
Mama said, "I had a gift, if I ever want to be something"
But I do this shit so she won't ever need nothing
No more payments or anything, I'm tryna move up
Renting crazy apartments, just to show my love
Appreciation, 'cause you only get one wifey and I'm thankful
And this life I lead is dangerous

Sexy, tease me with your lingerie
Water drippin' on me
Do what you want to do
Talk dirty, look me in the eyes and say (What?)
Ooh, fuck me please

Sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy
Fuck me please
Sexy, sexy (Ooh)
Sexy, sexy
Fuck me please

Oh
