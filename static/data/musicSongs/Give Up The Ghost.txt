Lyrics:


Are you ready?
"We're here"
I'm a rose that's been raised by wolves
My thorns are getting stuck in everything I know
It's so hard when you would bleed
For the truth you know
But we don't want the truth
We just want control

(I'm on my own, here we go)

C'mon man, put it on me
If you want it
'Cause I'm sick and tired of all of this
Flaunt it, if you want it, and you can own it
But I'm just gonna let it go

I've seen the devil and I've met fear
I met them both on the road
That led me here
I've met God and I saw life
And he saved mine a million times

I've met trouble and I've met rain
Laughed with joy, and cried with pain
But now I see and I believe
That the ghosts that haunt me
Have been outhaunted

I'm a long way from way back from home
Been traveling like a bullet everywhere I go
It gets harder to reach
When you're in control
'Cause you've either got the money
Or it's got your soul

(I'm on my own, here we go)

C'mon man, put it on me
If you want it
'Cause I'm sick and tired of all of this
Flaunt it, if you want it, and you can own it
But I'm just gonna let it go

I've seen the devil and I've met fear
I met them both on the road
That led me here
I've met God and I saw life
And he saved mine a million times

I've met trouble and I've met rain
Laughed with joy, and cried with pain
But now I see and I believe
That the ghosts that haunt me
Have been outhaunted

They never told me that I could be
Free from the hate that's inside of me
They took my place
Took my dignity
They kept me caged like an enemy

But I know now I can be
Free from the pain that's inside of me
You took my place
Gave me air to breathe
Opened the cage and you set me free

I've seen the devil and I've met fear
I met them both on the road
That led me here
I've met God and I saw life
And he saved mine a million times

I've met trouble and I've met rain
Laughed with joy, and cried with pain
But now I see and I believe
That the ghosts that haunt me
Have been outhaunted
