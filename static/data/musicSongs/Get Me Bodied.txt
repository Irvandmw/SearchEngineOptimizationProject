9 4 8 1 B-Day

Mission one
I'ma put this on
When he see me in the dress I'ma get me some (hey)
Mission two
Gotta make that call
Tell him get the bottles poppin' when they play my song (hey)
Mission three
Got my three best friends
Like we do it all the time we gonna do it again (hey)
Mission four
Got the vintage Rolls
Drop a couple hundreds tell him leave it at the door

I ain't worried doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight
Getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied (hey)

Can you get me bodied
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied
I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?
I want to let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance, wanna be myself tonight, me bodied

Mission five
Skip to the front of the line
Let me fix my hair up 'fore I go inside (hey)
Mission six
Gotta check these chicks
'Cause you know they gone block when I take these flicks (hey)
Mission seven
Gotta make my rounds
Given eyes to the guys now I think I found him (hey)
Mission eight
Now we conversate
And we can skip small talk let's get right to the chase (hey)

I ain't worried doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight
Getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied (hey)

You should see my body
I gotta know enough to know if you can get me bodied
I'm kinda tight, I'm feeling right enough to see somebody
I wanna let it off tonight
Wanna dance, wanna party wanna be myself tonight

Can you get me bodied
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied
I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?
I want to let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance, wanna be myself tonight, me bodied

Baby all I want is to let it go
Ain't no worries, oh
We can dance all night
Get me bodied
That means come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body's touching my body
All I need is to let it be
Ain't no worry, no
Boy dance with me
Feel my body
Don't stop just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
With your body touching my body

Get somebody
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair, kick off my shoes
Come here boy let me work on you

I ain't worried doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight
Getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied (hey)

Can you get me bodied
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied
I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?
I want to let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance, wanna be myself tonight, me bodied
