Lyrics:


I had this perfect dream
-Un sueÃ±o me envolviÃ³
This dream was me and you
-Tal vez estÃ¡s aquÃ­
I want all the world to see
-Un instinto me guiaba
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming true

The wind is a gentle breeze
-Ãl me hablÃ³ de ti
The bells are ringing out
-El canto vuela
They're calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish my dream would never go away

Barcelona - It was the first time that we met
Barcelona - How can I forget
The moment that you stepped into the room you took my breath away
Barcelona - La musica vibrÃ³
Barcelona - Y ella nos uniÃ³
And if God willing we will meet again, someday

Let the songs begin
-DÃ©jalo nacer
Let the music play
-Ahhhhhhhh...
Make the voices sing
-Nace un gran amor
Start the celebration
-Ven a mi
And cry
-Grita
Come alive
-Vive
And shake the foundations from the skies
Ah, Ah, Shaking all our lives

Barcelona - Such a beautiful horizon
Barcelona - Like a jewel in the sun
Por ti serÃ© gaviota de tu bella mar
Barcelona - Suenan las campanas
Barcelona - Abre tus puertas al mundo
If God is willing
-If God is willing
If God is willing
Friends until the end
Viva - Barcelona
