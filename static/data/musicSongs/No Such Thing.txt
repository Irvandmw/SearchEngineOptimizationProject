Lyrics:


[HoodyBaby:]
Fat fly nigga, real drink sipper
Hundred thou' in Vegas with a hundred bad bitches
Stars in the Wraith, you can see the Big Dipper (Dipper)
Ice in my face, you can see the big picture (Picture)
I'm HoodyBaby, that's my shit
Think I'm thinkin' 'bout a bitch, but I'm thinkin' bout the brick (Brick)
And if you comin' by yourself, I'ma dip
'Cause only two bitches satisfy my dick

[Chris Brown:]
No such thing as too many drinks
Follow me, and I'ma turn you out
Put that pussy in my face now
Girl, we 'bout to go twelve rounds now
Now let me touch it, let me rub it
Lately been spendin' money like, "Fuck it"
I never trust her, but go on, bust it
Bend it over, shake somethin', don't cuff it

I want you, you, and her, that's the liquor talkin'
Come off them shoes and that purse, that's my niggas talkin'
I'm super smooth off them Percs, got me moonwalkin'
Got my hand up her skirt, she screamin' out, "Ooh, papi"
I ain't with the actin', save the cappin' for a sucker
Hop up on my dick, lick the tip, need a nasty muhfucka
A bad bitch that get her back from her mama
I'ma need a stack, she gon' throw it back, show me somethin'

No such thing as too many drinks
Follow me, and I'ma turn you out
Put that pussy in my face now
Girl, we 'bout to go twelve rounds now
Now let me touch it, let me rub it
Lately been spendin' money like, "Fuck it"
I never trust her, but go on, bust it
Bend it over, shake somethin', don't cuff it
