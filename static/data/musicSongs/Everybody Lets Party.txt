Lyrics:


I'm on the floor now
And looking for the right way to speak to you
Oh, oh
Fire, see the smoke now
Call the paramedics, baby, needs a rescue, huh
Just lose control-ol
Your body's calling for me
Get loose some more-re, oh

Don't change for me, girl, love the way you are
'Cause I'm dangerous, girl, I'ma steal your heart
If you let me
Want a good girl to get, get, get dirty
It ain't the same, but so what?
She came to play 'cause she wanna be naughty
On the dancefloor

She's all over me now, now, now, now
She's dancing on me, Dirty Diana
Don't slow down 'cause I like it
Just let it go

Don't stand on the wall
Just get on the floor and party
'Cause tonight, you can have it all
So go out and dance with somebody
One, two, three, go!

Oh-oh-oh, everybody
Oh-oh-oh, let's party
Oh-oh-oh, everybody
It's our, it's our, it's our, it's our destiny

All these bright lights creating an illusion on us, damn
But I know you want me
To feel you from your head to your toes
'Cause I like your private parts, ooh
If you feeling lonely
I'll be right there
I can make you who you wanna be
Baby, don't be scared

Don't change for me, girl, love the way you are (Oh)
'Cause I'm dangerous, girl, I'ma steal your heart
If you let me
Want a good girl to get, get, get dirty (Oh, oh)
It ain't the same, but so what? (Yeah)
She came to play 'cause she wanna be naughty
On the dancefloor

She's all over me now, now, now, now
She's dancing on me, Dirty Diana
Don't slow down 'cause I like it
Just let it go

Don't stand on the wall
Just get on the floor and party
'Cause tonight, you can have it all
So go out and dance with somebody
One, two, three, go!

Oh-oh-oh, everybody
Oh-oh-oh, let's party
Oh-oh-oh, everybody
It's our, it's our, it's our, it's our destiny

Destiny
Everybody
It's our, it's our destiny
Di-Dirty Diana

Don't stand on the wall
Just get on the floor and party
'Cause tonight, you can have it all
So go out and dance with somebody
One, two, three, go!

Oh-oh-oh, everybody
Oh-oh-oh, let's party
Oh-oh-oh, everybody
It's our, it's our, it's our, it's our destiny
