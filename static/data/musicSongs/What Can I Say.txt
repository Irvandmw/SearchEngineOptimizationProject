Lyrics:


Lonely nights; empty days, use me up so many ways.
You came along and stole my heart away.
I just wanna hold you darlin', tonight,
knowin' that the love between us is right.
I can't believe that you'd ever let me go; oh, no.

[Chorus:]
What can I say? What can I do? I'm so in love with you.
Got to be strong; but, for how long must I have this feeling?
Won't go away.

Take me back to yesterday, I just wanna fade away
Closer to you that what we used to be.
Are we really gonna let it die? Close the book and give it one more try.
I can't believe that you'd ever let me go; oh, no.

[Chorus]
