Lyrics:


Talk to a baddie, call me in traffic
Come up to Magic, if you're tryin' see me

Bitch ass nigga, lost a couple mil last year, got figures
Made a couple bags, my bag got bigger
I'ma make it hard for them to trace my pictures 
God damn
Made a hundred mill' my nigga
Need a big booty bitch to fall in love with me
I can make it hard for you to fall in love with me

My bitch asked me why I always stay extra'd out
All my whips got extras now
Why so many hoes, on the low?
Why my niggas extras? (Extra, extra, extra)
Why my bitches so extra?
I'm always on extra

Pour me another one, I cannot slow
Until I can't feel no more pain
Pour me another one, I cannot slow
Until I can't feel no more pain

Jump out this bitch got the water again
This bitch is callin' me Aquaman
I got her phone number callin' again
(Callin' again) Callin' again
Benji's on Benji's on Benji's again
That's all I been on since you got with him
Ain't been the same since 
I want to save my pain (Pain)
You know it's all before, man these hoes all in love
Had to hit all the clubs, swapped out the ones before
Big booty from my city, never seen nothin' like
Nothin' like hit and quit

My bitch asked me why I always stay extra'd out
All my whips got extras now
Why so many hoes, on the low?
Why my niggas extras? (Extra, extra, extra)
Why my bitches so extra?
I'm always on extra

Pour me another one, I cannot slow
Until I can't feel no more pain
