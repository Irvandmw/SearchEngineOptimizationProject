Lyrics:


A gal is like a racehorse, I play her to win
But if I should lose her, another may come in
Love can be like heaven, love can be a joke
But it's worth a gamble, so hey I go for broke

Who's got the action?
Who'll take a chance on love?
Who's got a kiss for me?
Give me one and you'll get back three
Who's got the action?
Just lay it on the line
I'll bet you 10 to 1 you'll be mine

Now once I had a Philly, I ain't seen her since
Some can't go the distance, they're only good in sprints
Sweethearts stay together, when it's fair and warm
But in stormy weather, they don't run to form

Who's got the action?
Who'll take a chance on love?
Who's got a kiss for me?
Give me one and you'll get back three
Who's got the action?
Just lay it on the line
I'll bet you 10 to 1 you'll be mine

Favored or a long shot, I'll play either way
All I need's a winner, and this could be the day
And when I won my parlay, I'll be set for life
I'll take all that money, and gamble it on my wife

Who's got the action?
Who'll take a chance on love?
Who's got a kiss for me?
Give me one and you'll get back three
Who's got the action?
Just lay it on the line
I'll bet you 10 to 1, I'll bet you 10 to 1
I'll bet you 10 to 1 you will be mine
