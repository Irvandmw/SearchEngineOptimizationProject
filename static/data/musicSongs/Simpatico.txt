Lyrics:


Your eyes are simpatico
Tonight they have told me
That you'll be simpatico
To me alone

Your arms are simpatico
And when they enfold me
They hold me within a spell
No lover has ever known

When you do the things you do to me
Every thrill I knew is new to me
Go on and do the things you do to me
When do you what you do
You're so sympathetic
Which means you're simpatico
Which means I'm in heaven
And heaven will be our home
When you are mine

When you do the things you do to me
Every thrill I knew is new to me
Go on and do the things you do to me
When do you what you do
You're so sympathetic
Which means you're simpatico
Which means I'm in heaven
And heaven will be our home
When you are mine
