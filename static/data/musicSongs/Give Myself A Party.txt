Lyrics:


I've got a lot of memories to last me the rest of my life 
so if you don't wanna love me, baby that'll be alright 
I'm gonna take all the lovin' that I have for you 
gonna take all the loneliness an' sit right down with the blues! 

I'm gonna give myself a party, an' serve old memories 
give my self a party, think of how it used to be 
Remember all the happiness that once we knew 
gonna give myself a party, just me an' the blues! 

[instrumental break]

A few of your love letters, a photograph or two 

a gift you gave on my birthday with words of "I love you" 
There's lots of things to think about, when you're feelin' blue 
so I'm gonna take all the loneliness, sit right down with the blues! 

I'm gonna give myself a party, an' serve old memories 
give my self a party, think of how it used to be 
Remember all the happiness that once we knew 
I'm gonna give myself a party, just me an' the blues! 

...just me an' the blues!
