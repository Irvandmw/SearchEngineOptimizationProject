Lyrics:


When you wanna do something thatâs new.
And it seems really, really hard to do.
You feel like quitting, you feel youâre through.
Well I have some advice for you

Donât give up, keep on trying,
Yâall gonna make it (ah yeah) donât give up.
Donât ever quit, try and try and you can do it, donât give up (yeah)

If you want to catch a ball, but youâre having no luck at all.
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose.
It hits your belly, your chin and toes.
Well try and try and try again, keep on trying and soon
Youâll put your hands out in the air,
Youâll catch that ball, yes this I swear

Donât give up, keep on going.
Youâre on a boat, so keep on rowing
Donât give up, donât ever stop,
Try and try and youâll come out on top, donât give up.

You got yourself new roller-skates.
You put them on and you feel great,
Stand up, but then you fall,
Donât think you can skate at all.
You get back up and then you trip
You skip and tip and slip and flip
Well try and try and try some more,
And soon youâre skating across the floor.

Donât give up, keep on moving.
Youâre gonna get there just keep on grooving
Donât give up, donât pack it in,
Try and try and you will win, donât give up.
No no no, donât give up
No no no, donât give up
No no no, donât give up, no no
Donât give up
