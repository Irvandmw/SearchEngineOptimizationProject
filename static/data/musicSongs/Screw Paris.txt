Lyrics:


Cut by diamond ring
Baby you know it stings
I bled out for you
I bled out for you

Blame all you promises
Hate on your perfect kiss
Like honey so smooth
Honey so smooth

Ooh, will your memory fade
Ooh, if I can forgot your face
Part of my soul got part of it left in the rain
Screw Paris and the plans that we made

I'll take these heavy load
The pickups don't hit the road
Running from you
Just running from you

I'm still feeling guilty love
I still want your body song
Ain't it the truth
Its painting the truth

Ooh, will your memory fade
Ooh, if I can forgot your face
Part of my soul got part of it left in the rain
Screw Paris and the plans that we made

Yeah I've been battling your ghost
Yeah I still smell you on my clothes
Yeah I nearly broke down and drove by your place
Screw Paris and the plans that we made

Cut by diamond ring
Baby you know it stings
I bled out for you
I bled out for you
