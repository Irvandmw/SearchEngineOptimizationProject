Lyrics:


Heavy metal lover [repeat]

I want your whiskey mouth
All over my blonde south
Red wine, cheap perfume
And a filthy pout

Tonight bring all your friends
Because a group does it better
Why river with a pair?
Let's have a full house of leather

Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover

Dirty pony I can't wait to hose you down
You've got to earn your leather in this part of town

Dirty pearls and a patch for all the Rivington Rebels
Let's raise hell in the streets, drink beer and get into trouble

Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover

I could be your girl girl girl girl girl girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world world world?

Whip me slap me, punk funk
New York clubbers, bump drunk
Bud Lite, liquors, bar slam
Move it, this is your jam

Wash the night with St. Jameson
Like a baptism,
Heavy metal lovers play
Baby, we were born this way

Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover

I could be your girl girl girl girl girl girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world world world?

Heavy metal lover [repeat]
