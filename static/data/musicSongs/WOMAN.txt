Lyrics:


She mistakes my name
I feel the light come around
Strange as it seems
I'm bursting at the seams
And oh, I've got a woman now

Her wallet photos don't turn me on
I feel her hand come around
Her stone-wash denim jeans are much
Darker than they seem
And oh, I've got a woman now

She said, "My name is Eileen
Boy that's all you need
Oh, and this one's on the house
I don't mind"

It all tastes the same
But boy there's something different about your mouth
And you try chasing dreams, it's much
Harder than it seems
And oh, I've got a woman now
And oh, I've got a woman now

And oh, I've got a woman now
And oh, he's got a woman now
