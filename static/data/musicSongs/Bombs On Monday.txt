Lyrics:


Pinky promise
I'll still love your garden
Even with no flowers
Even with no flowers

Doctor's orders
Don't be brokenhearted
Time will still be ours
Time will still be ours

Never thought that something
Something so tragic
Could ever happen to
Our peaceful, little perfect family

I promise
Promise to love you
You and the children
Carousel spinnin'
Our neighborhood will always be this pretty

Bombs are falling
On Monday morning
Waiting for the news together
An explosion, any moment
You make moments last forever and ever
(You make moments last forever)

Eyes like hazel
Twinkle in the starlight
Even when they're crying
Even when they're crying

Constellations
Forming out of scar lines
Even when they're dying
Love will still be trying

Never thought that something
Something so tragic
Could ever happen to
Our peaceful, little perfect family

I promise
Promise to love you
You and the children
Carousel spinnin'
Our neighborhood will always be this pretty

Bombs are falling
On Monday morning
Waiting for the news together
An explosion, any moment
You make moments last forever and ever

Bombs are falling on Monday morning
Bombs are falling
You make moments last forever

Bombs are falling
On Monday morning
Waiting for the news together
An explosion, any moment
You make moments last forever and ever

Bombs are falling on Monday morning
Bombs are falling
You make moments last forever

You make moments last forever
