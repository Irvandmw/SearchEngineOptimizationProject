Lyrics:


Tell you babe. I'm not the lovin' kind
So you'd better get it right off of your mind
I'll give you money, I don't care
I'll take you with me, anywhere
Oh, tell you babe, I'm not the lovin' kind

Tell you babe I'm not the lovin' kind
Get you somebody else,
And you'll do just fine
Cast your tears into the sea
Don't waste your tears on me
I tell you babe, I'm not the lovin' kind

I tell you baby I'm not the lovin' kind
So you'd better move on down the line
I told you do
I've never lie
Loves a train I never ride
Oh tell you babe, I'm not the lovin' kind

I told you so, I've never lied
Loves a train I'll never ride
Oh tell you babe, I'm not the lovin' kind
