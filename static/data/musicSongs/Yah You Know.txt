Lyrics:


You know, you know, you know

What's the matter with you
Ain't you got nothing better to do
Than to dance your life away
At the local disco (disco, disco, disco)
You're polyester punk to the bone
No wonder you came alone
We're all grossed out
'Cause you spit when you talk
Say yah, you know

Keep singing yah, you know
Yah, you know
There's more to life than spitting when you talk
Saying yah, you know

What's the matter with you
You smell like diesel fume
Whoever told you it was cool to drink Perrier
Even a blind man knows
That black looks better in the snow
We're all grossed out
'Cause you spit when you talk
Say yah, you know

Keep singing yah, you know
Yah, you know
There's more to life than spitting when you talk
Saying yah, you know

Yah, you know (oh, yeah)
Yah, you know

What's the matter with you
Ain't you got nothing better to do
Than to sit unemployed watching television like a fool
Living in a bag of fast food
I guess it wouldn't seem so crude
But everybody's grossed
'Cause you spit when you talk
Say yah, you know

Keep singing yah, you know
Yah, you know
There's more to life than spitting when you talk
Saying yah, you know

Yah, you know
Yah, you know
There's more to life than spitting when you talk
Saying yah, you know

Yah, you know, like, I would get a job
But the world's gonna end soon
You got any 'ludes?
