Lyrics:


At this special time of year
I'm so very glad you're here
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

A field of freshly fallen snow
And we've got nowhere else to go
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you

I hear sleigh bells in the distance
And songs sung by a choir
It's snowin' and it's blowin'
So let's stay here by the fire

Mistletoe and a festive tree
There's no place that I'd rather be
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you

I hear sleigh bells in the distance
And songs sung by a choir
It's freezin' but it's pleasing
To lets lay here for awhile

Oh it's snowin' and it's blowin'
So let's stay here by the fire
I'm sending lots of Christmas cheer
This season and throughout the year

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Ya merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Merry merry merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
