Lyrics:


[Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missing
Yeah yeah
That shit look like a toupee

get what you get in 10 years, in two days
Ladies love me
Iâm on my cool J
If you get what I get what would you say
She wax it all off, Mr Miyagi
And them suicide doors, Hari Kari

[Hook]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, Iâm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresh than a muthafucker

Lil nigga bigger than gorilla
Cause Iâm killing every nigga that
Try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her
I can get her
And she accidentally slip fall on my dick
Ooops, I said on my dick
I ainât really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
Iâm Done

[Twista]
Now let a track go past like this and Twista not fuck with it, yâall done lost your mind
I could hit you with the auto-matic-flow, I could do any rhythm and any pattern
That I wanna do the harder that it go, you could see blood spilling out from a body
Right in front of you, and Imma get the dough,
now the way I be shinin be havin everybody lookin at me
Fuckin them up when I buck up I step up and ballâ¦ I do a murder when Iâm trigger happy like
I got the intricate power to kill her for currency when Iâm be anna but Imma be making âem holler
Cause Iâm a kedavers when Iâm attackin the beat Iâm a scholar cause Iâm a personification of god,
So you better honor (what!?) Mr. immaculate now Iâm breakin it, marble sack your lyricist
Iâll be here forever, haters wanna hate on me because they wanna hear whatever
I could spit a rhythm to a bitch and get her pussy wetter,
pimpin on a bitch and tell her I could get her pussy cheddar
so I get the camera wanna go and make a movie
me up in the back on top to get the booty, didnât wanna show her face even though she was a cutie
nine millimeter and spillin millions of milliliters of life out a nigga if he talk shit
C.E.O step into my office, comin with the awkward flow like Iâm sick
Go get your momma to bring a thermometer, my temperatures hot
Come up with a flow that would kill a industry, and I could pick anything that I want off the lot
Never compatible cause I be intricate, when I be servin you, when I be doin it, at a place
I know they cant leave me, think Twista could kill em on a track wit busta breezy and weezy? Easy!

[Hook]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, Iâm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresh than a muthafucker

[Lil Wayne]
Man fuck these bitch ass niggas how yall doin?
Iâm Lil Tunechi, Iâm a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the 3 stooges
I donât eat sushi, Iâm the shit, no Iâm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ainât eatin, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot em, and I said ok,
If you wanted bullshit then Iâm like olay,
I donât care what you say, so donât even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
Thatâs word to my flag, and my flag red
Iâm out of my head, bitch Iâm outta my mind from the bottom I climb
You ainât hotter at mine, nope, not on my time and Iâm not even trying
Whats poppin Slime? nothin five, and if they trippin fuck em five
I ainât got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and sprite on a private flight
Bitch Iâm enticing, guiding light, and my pockets white and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddyâs dead
You faggots scared cause Iâm too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
Iâm so young money if you got eyes look at me now bitch

[Hook]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, Iâm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresh than a muthafucker
