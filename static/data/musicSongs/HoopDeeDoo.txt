Lyrics:


Hoop-dee-doo, hoop-dee-doo
I hear a polka and my troubles are through
Hoop-dee-doo, hoop-dee-dee
This kind of music is like heaven to me
Hoop-dee-doo, hoop-dee-doo
Has got me higher than a kite
Hand me down my soup and fish
I am gonna get my wish
Hoop-dee-doin' it tonight

When there's a trombone playin'
I get a thrill, I always will
When there's a concertina stretched about a mile
I always smile 'cause that's my style
When there's a fiddle in the middle
Oh, it really is a riddle how he plays a tune so sweet
Plays a tune so sweet that I could die
Lead me to the floor and hear me yell for more
'Cause I'm a hoop-dee-doin' kind of guy

(Hoop-dee-doo), hoop-dee-doo
(Hoop-dee-doo), hoop-de-doo
(I hear a polka and my troubles are through)
Ha, ha, ha
(Hoop-dee-doo), hoop-dee-doo
(Hoop-dee-dee) hoop-de-dee
(This kind of music is like heaven to me)

Oh, hoop-dee-doo (hoop-hee-doo)
Hoop-dee-doo (hoop-Dee-Doo)
Has got me higher than a kite
Hand me down my soup and fish
I am gonna get my wish
Hoop-dee-doin' it tonight

(When there's a trombone playin')
Ah, ha, ha, ha
(He gets a thrill)
I get a thrill, I always will
(He always will)
(When there's a concertina stretched about a mile
I always smile (You'll see him smile)
'Cause that's my style (Oh, that's his style)
When there's a fiddle in the middle
Oh, it really is a riddle how he plays a tune so sweet
(Plays a tune so sweet that we could die)
Ah, yes lead me to the floor and hear me yell for more
'Cause I'm a hoop-dee-doin' kind of guy

Ooooh, hoop-dee-doo, hoop-dee-doo
It's got us higher than a kite
They're in clover, we're in bloom
When we're dancin' give us room
Hoop-de-doin' it with all of our might
Rain may fall and snow may come
Nothin's gonna stop us from
Hoop-dee-doin' it
Hoop-dee-doin' it
Hoop-dee-doin' it tonight
