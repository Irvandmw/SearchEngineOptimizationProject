Lyrics:


I rolled in from the east with my pearly white tee
Hotter than the heat in July
With my wind-blown hair; it just wasn't fair
The way I was blowin' your mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane
Gets its name from a girl like this?
I'm a cat five kind, keeps you up at night
Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss

Like a beautiful mess
Well yeah, the kind you love to love
But what happens next?
I got a feelin' when the sun comes up

You're gonna wish you had a storm warning
You're gonna wish you had a sign (Gonna wish you had a sign)
You're gonna wish you had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the morning
You're gonna wish you had a storm warning
Woah, you're gonna wish you had a storm warning
Yeah, ou-oh

Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels
Somewhere between going and gone?
You get so lost that you can't turn it off
You give in and you just turn it on
I'm a heart full of rain, red lips like a flame
Yeah a girl from your favorite song

Like a beautiful mess
I'm one part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
Oh, the kind of flood you'll never forget

You're gonna wish you had a storm warning
You're gonna wish you had a sign (Gonna wish you had a sign)
You're gonna wish you had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the morning
You're gonna wish you had a storm warning
Woah, you're gonna wish you had a storm warning
Yeah

Yo, yo, I come in strong with gods powers and change the weather
You're gonna be beggin' Rihanna for that umbrella
'Cause I'ma shake shake you like a hurricane
Twist and turn you, I'ma make it rain
Rain from the skies with that bang bang boom
Like thundering cries gotta zoom zoom zoom
Runaway from the slub, quick and be done
Unless if you believe you are the one
Gonna wish you had a storm warning
Gonna wish you had a sign (Gonna wish you had a sign)
You're gonna wish you had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the morning
Hey

You're gonna wish you had a storm warning
You're gonna wish you had a sign (Gonna wish you had a sign)
You're gonna wish you had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love (Love)
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the morning (Finds the morning)
Hey, hey
You're gonna wish you had a storm warning
Woah, you're gonna wish you had a storm warning
Yeah (Woah), yeah
