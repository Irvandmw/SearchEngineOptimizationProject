Lyrics:


How long can you stay uncomfortable? (ooh, yeah)
And how long can you stand out in the cold? (ooh)
And baby, when you decide that he just ain't right
I need to know, I need to know-ow-ow

Baby, your skin like porcelain
Like ocean waves, your mind's amazing oh
Can I be your everything?
When we still cloudy, up your patience
You can't keep wasting
All your days on wondering
Why he just don't get it

Oh, I just came to calm your troubled waters
Down (down) to be (to be) aligned (aligned), I swear I got you
You can't keep wasting
All your days on wondering
Why he just don't get it

You're there but you don't wanna be (oh-oh)
You stay 'til it's too hard to breathe
And I don't think it's worth your time
So why you not mine?
I need to know, I need to know-ow-ow

Baby, your skin like porcelain
Like ocean waves, your mind's amazing oh
Can I be your everything?
When we still cloudy, up your patience
You can't keep wasting (you can't)
All your days on wondering
Why he just don't get it

I just came to calm (oh) your troubled waters
Down (down) to be (to be) aligned (aligned), I swear I got you
You can't keep wasting
All your days on wondering
Why he just don't get it

Baby, I'll be your lifeguard
Through everything (everything)
If you stay with me (ha)
Oh-oh, oh
I'll be your lifeguard
Through everything (everything)
If you stay with me
Oh-whoa

I just came (came) to calm (calm) your troubled waters
Down (down) to be (to be) aligned (yeah), I swear I got you
('Cause you can't keep wasting)
You can't keep wasting (all your time)
All your days on wondering
Why he just don't get it
