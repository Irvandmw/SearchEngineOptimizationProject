Lyrics:


Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train
Brought my baby back home

Train, train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train, train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Well it took my baby
But it never will again
No, not again

Train, train, comin' down, down the line
Train, train, comin' down, down the line
Well it's bringin' my baby
'Cause she's mine all mine

Train, train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train, train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Well it took my baby
But it never will again
Oh no, not again

Train, train, oh yeah
Well it took my baby
But it never will again
