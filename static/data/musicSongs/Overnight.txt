Lyrics:


I remember way back, late night, throwback
Sitting on the front lawn talking
When I lost it, and do I lost it
I remember you were saying you would come back, run back
Find me on the front porch like that
But you waited, so I got wasted

And I've always said I'd never let myself hold on this long

'Cause people change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I'm still high
And I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me, lie to me, lie to me
I'm gone

I still wonder if I called you, what would I do?
Leave you too long voicemail that I hate and then erase it
I've got planned it
And I wonder if I still lived in the city, would I see you at a party
Take a big sip of my whiskey and then I'll leave quickly
And pray you missed me

And although I still know exactly how this ends I keep holding on

'Cause people change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I'm still high
And I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
You know I'll meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me, I'm gone

Oh, I feel it in me
Please forgive me
Leave this memory
Don't say you miss me
I know it's still in me
Please forgive me
Leave this memory
Don't say you miss me

'Cause people change overnight
Things get strange, I'm alright
I'm still here, and I might still be high
'Cause I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me, lie to me

Change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I might still be high
But I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
Know if you meet me in the middle of the night
You know I'll meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me, lie to me, then lie to me
I'm gone
