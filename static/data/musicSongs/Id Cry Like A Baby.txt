Lyrics:


I'd cry like a baby if you told me goodbye
I'd feel like a snowball on the 4th of July
If you ever said you were leaving for good
I'd weep like a weeping willow, honest I would
I'd cry like a baby with a busted balloon
I'd let out a wail that would be heard to the moon
Our love was so splendid don't end it so soon
Don't leave me here sighing, sobbing and a-sighing
Crying like a baby for you

I'd cry like a baby if you told me goodbye
I'd feel like a snowball on the 4th of July
If you ever said you were leaving for good
I'd weep like a weeping willow, honest I would
I'd cry like a baby with a busted balloon
I'd let out a wail that would be heard to the moon
Our love was so splendid don't end it so soon
Don't leave me here sighing, sobbing and a-sighing
Crying like a baby for you
