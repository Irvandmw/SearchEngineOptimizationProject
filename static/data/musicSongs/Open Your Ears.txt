Lyrics:


Canât get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
Iâll say what I donât mean

In your world we were the same
In mine now youâre the one to blame
You canât remember my name
Weâre lost, itâs such a shame

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Iâve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see

Iâm strong yet proud
Iâm quiet yet loud
And Iâm everything
You want in me
Iâm small yet tall
I have it all
And Iâm everything
You want me to be

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Iâve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see

And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
Iâm on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Iâve been waiting for
Listen to me
Making me see
