Song Name: I Got Plenty O' Nuttin'
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I got plenty o'nothin' and nothin's plenty for me
I got no car, got no mule, I got no misery
Folks with plenty of plenty, they got a lock on the door
Afraid somebody's gonna rob 'em while they're out a'makin' more
What for?
I got no lock on the door, that's no way to be
They can steal the rug from the floor, that's OK with me
'cause the things that I prize, like the stars in the skies, are all free
Say, I got plenty o'nothin' and nothin's plenty for me
I got my gal, got my song, got heaven the whole day long
Got my gal
Got my love
Got my song

I got plenty o'nothin' and nothin's plenty for me
I got my gal, got my song, I got heaven the whole day long
Got my gal
Got my love
Got my song
