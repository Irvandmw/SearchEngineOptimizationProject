Lyrics:


So when you wake up this morning
And those blues are hangin' 'round, yeah
Just listen baby
And I'll tell you what to do
I just may join you, 'neath your bed
And turn on your electric brandy
Woah, and turn our thoughts to me
'Cause you know where I'll be
And then you can join me
In my hour in the shower
Join me in my hour in the shower.
