Lyrics:


I'm your chum [JL] I forgot you're my chum
I'm your friend [JL] Through thick and thin
I'm your pal [JL] That's right you're my pal
'Til you die [JL] Already I'm sick
Which reminds me when you were sick remember how I nursed you
Stayed by your side and wouldn't go away
[JL] Yeh but what have you done for me lately
[JL] What did you do for me today
Today, everyday
