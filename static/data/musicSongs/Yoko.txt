Lyrics:


[Berner]
Bust a couple bands
Blow a 100 fast
I just made a hundred off of 50 pay
Where them bad Asian bitches holdin down my city at?
Where them girls from the A with that pretty face?
Round thing, yeah Iâm on that loud thang
Pop another bottle, shooting corks at the crowd: dang!
Yeah, Iâm a stunna, nah, I ainât Baby tho
Young dude with the lazy flow
Watch all these ladies go
Crazy when I pull up right beside em
I do a buck 30, Iâm just into flying
I smell like dirty money, plus this cookie that Iâm lighting
Bucketâs full of ice and bottles on fire inside em

[Hook]
Call em Yoko Ono
Only ride solo
Mission for the dolo
One look in her eyes, sheâll eat you alive
Sheâs a man eater, ski mask diva
She might up ân leave you, but you can never leave her
You ainât never had someone, you can never keep her
Tricking on the next man, he canât have her either..
I Call her Yoko Ono

[Chris Brown]
Look, got a boatload of them Asian hoes
On vacation steady bakin with Jamaican hoes
I got cash boy, I donât care what you makin ho
50 thousand on my wrist: Iâm feedin eskimos
Damn! Put VA on this shit
Buy 100 fuckin bottles, let em spray in this bitch
My money flow real long, I do relays in this bitch
And you know I kill songs, itâs Burner, CB & Wiz
Alrighty now, ha, look at me, rose, Iâm on nigga
15 grand on a what, Thatâs just my phone, nigga
Northern California, where blunts look like cones, nigga
Two up, two down, make that switch, yeah

[Hook]
Call em Yoko Ono
Only ride solo
Mission for the dolo
One look in her eyes, sheâll eat you alive
Sheâs a man eater, ski mask diva
She might leave you, but you can never leave her
You ainât never had someone, you can never keep her
Tricking on the next man, he canât have her either..
Call her Yoko Ono

[Wiz Khalifa]
Shades on, Polo white T
Me leaving here alone? Thatâs unlikely
Not a stoner bitch, but she like me
Tryna get that final cut like Spike Lee
I jack them hoes, direct them hoes
Take âem home and let them hoes go live out their fantasies
Theyâre popping pills, Iâm rolling weed
Even got a couple bad bitches overseas
Out the back, as ainât no tags when Iâm shopping
And my bad filled with options so donât ask what it cost
Iâm in a Maserati coupe going so fast that I lost âem
And my bitch got so much swag that these bad bitches on us
Ah! Killing yâall, pow! (dag) get a a coffin
