Artist: Frank Sinatra Lyrics
Song Name: The Twelve Days Of Christmas
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


[Traditional version:]
On the (first) day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Twelve lords leaping, Eleven ladies dancing, Ten pipers piping
Nine drummers drumming, Eight maids milking, Seven swans swimming
Six geese laying, Five gold rings
Four calling birds, Three french hens, Two turtle doves,
And a partridge in a pear tree

[Frank's version:]
On the (first) day of Christmas, we gave our loving dad (my children gave to me)
Twelve dozen kisses, Eleven jars of jelly, Ten silken hankies,
Nine games of Scrabble, Eight pairs of cuff-links, Seven books of fiction,
Six woolen nightshirts, Five ivory combs,
Four Meerschaum pipes, Three golf clubs, Two silken scarves,
And a most lovely lavender tie.
