Lyrics:


Why do you look so familiar
I could swear that I have seen your face before

I think I like that you seem sincere
I think I like to get to know you a little bit more

I think there's something more
Life's worth living for

Who knows what could happen
Do what you do, just keep on laughing
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

How do you always have an opinion
And how do you always find the best way to compromise

We don't need to have a reason
We don't need anything
We're just wasting time

I think there's something more
Life's worth living for

Who knows what could happen
Do what you do, just keep on laughing
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day

Who knows what could happen
Do what you do, just keep on laughing
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

Find yourself, 'cause I can't find you
Be yourself
Who are you?
Find yourself, 'cause I can't find you
Be yourself
Who are you?

Who knows what could happen
Do what you do, just keep on laughing
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day

So you go and make it happen
Do your best just keep on laughing
I'm telling you: there's always a brand new day

Who knows what could happen
Do what you do, just keep on laughing
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day
