I...I...I...I...

Erotic City, Erotic City

All of my purple life
I've been looking for a dame
That would wanna be my wife
That was my intention main

(If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time)
Fuck so pretty, you and me
Erotic City come alive

(We can fuck until the dawn
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone)
Erotic City, can't you see?
Fuck so pretty, you and me

Every time I comb my hair
Thoughts of you get in my eyes
You're a sinner, I don't care
I just want your creamy thighs

(If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time)
Fuck so pretty, you and me
Erotic City come alive

(We can fuck until the dawn
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone)
Erotic City, can't you see?
Fuck so pretty, you and me

Woo!

All of my hang-ups are gone
How I wish you felt the same
We could fuck until the dawn (Until the dawn)
How I wish you were my dame (Baby, won't you be my dame?)

(If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time)
Fuck so pretty, you and me
Erotic City come alive

(We can fuck until the dawn
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone)
Erotic City, can't you see?
Fuck so pretty, you and me

Woah woah, woah woah, woah woah woah
Woah woah, woah woah, woah woah woah
Woah woah, woah woah, woah woah woah

(If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time)
Fuck so pretty, you and me
Erotic City come alive

(We can fuck until the dawn
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone)
Erotic City, can't you see?
Fuck so pretty, you and me

(If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time)
Some time, some time, some time
Erotic City

(If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time)
Fuck so pretty, you and me
Erotic City come alive

We can fuck until the dawn
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City, can't you see?
Fuck so pretty, you and me

(We can fuck until the dawn
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone)
Erotic City, can't you see?
Fuck so pretty, you and me

I, I, I, I
Erotic City, yeah
