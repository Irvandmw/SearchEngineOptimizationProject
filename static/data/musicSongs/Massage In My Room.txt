Lyrics:


I hate if you love her, I'm gon' fuck her
Five plain watches in my duffle
I got twenty freaks in my room
I got twenty freaks in my room
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
I just went skiing with a bad bitch
I spent twenty thousand on a jacket
I bought all the hitters some more ratchets

I just took a meeting out in Aspen
You get out of line, it's gon' be drastic
Pay my dawg a Perc, it made him happy
Put you in a hearse like an assassin
Runnin' through the game with some lettuce
I just want the green like Aladdin
She kept it low-key, I was straddlin'
I gave her more wood than a cabin

I hate if you love her, I'm gon' fuck her
Five plain watches in my duffle
I got twenty freaks in my room
I got twenty freaks in my room
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
I just went skiing with a bad bitch
I spent twenty thousand on a jacket
I bought all the hitters some more ratchets

Twenty freaks at the embassy
I just pissed on a hundred Gs
Ace of Spades when the lights off
Wrist movin' like CB
Bought the Lamb' for the energy
Got you main at topped off
Check callin', roger that
Drake callin', roger that
Lean callin', roger that
Check callin', roger that, check
Check the work, 10-4
Codeine, indo
Wrist cost a Bentley truck
Wrist cost a Bentley truck
Had drugs on me, lot of red
Then I hit the globe, a lot of red
Copped a speedboat and docked it
Left-overs in my pocket
I'm a take her like a rocket
I'm a hold this money hostage

I hate if you love her, I'm gon' fuck her
Five plain watches in my duffle
I got twenty freaks in my room
I got twenty freaks in my room
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
I just went skiing with a bad bitch
I spent twenty thousand on a jacket
I bought all the hitters some more ratchets

While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
I just went skiing with a bad bitch
I bought all the hitters some more ratchets
