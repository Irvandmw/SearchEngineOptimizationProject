Lyrics:


[Brian:]
In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor

[Nick:]
I looked down
And my shirt's turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice
In my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight

[All:]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it

No, I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

[Howie:]
Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone

[AJ:]
Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't
I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight

[All:]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it

No, I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

[Nick:]
In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest voice
A gunshot on the floor

[All:]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Straight through my heart
(Soldier down)
She aimed and she shot me
(Soldier down)
I just can't believe it

No, I can't resist
(I can't resist)
And I can't be hit
(No, I can't)
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart )
Soldier down (my heart )

(oh oh straight through my oh oh)

Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)
My heart
My heart

Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)
