Lyrics:


Oh please don't go, I need you.
I'll please you, not mislead you
If you would be my only one.
Together we move slowly. 
I'll never leave you lonely
If you would be my only one.
If you believe we were meant to be,
Why'd you leave me alone?
If you believe we were meant to be,
Why'd you leave me alone?
What hapened to forever?
I'll try to make things better
If you would be my only one.
Now six days since we've spoken.
I'll fix you when you're broken
If you would be my only one.
If you believe we were meant to be,
Why'd you leave me alone?
If you believe we were meant to be,
Why'd you leave me alone?
If you love me too, can I call you my only one?
If you say no, I won't let go
My only one.
If you believe we were meant to be,
Why'd you leave me alone?
If you believe we were meant to be,
Why'd you leave me alone?
