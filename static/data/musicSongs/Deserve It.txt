Lyrics:


And I tried to use my heart and they hurt it
And I tried to do my part, I ain't perfect
I should've listened up when everybody said, "Don't fuck with everybody"
'Cause I gave you my heart, you ain't deserve it
And I tried to use my heart and they hurt it
And I tried to do my part, I ain't perfect
I should've listened up when everybody said, "Don't fuck with everybody" (Huh, huh)
'Cause I gave you my heart, you ain't deserve it

When you come up from nothing, it's crazy
What you know about your own people hating (What?)
I'm talking about your partner (Yeah, yeah)
I'm talking about your clique (Yeah, yeah, not my dawg)
I'm talking about your brother (Yeah, yeah)
I'm talking about your bitch (Yeah, yeah)
She make me sick (God damn)
I'm on a light brown thing, she all on my dick (God damn)
She look like Halle Berry, I fuck and I dip (God damn)
I can't do no muhfuckin' favors, get up, get some muhfuckin' paper
I taught these lil' boys how to turn up (Turn up)
They turned to some muhfuckin' haters (Hate)
I'm cuttin' off all of the leeches (Leech)
They taking my heart, tryna eat me (Eat)
Must of forgot how I'm rocking (Uh)
They taking my kindness for weakness (Hey)
Anything I do outta love (Love), so if you don't love me, I'ma peep it (Hey)
That look in your eyes, it's deceitful (Hey)
That look in your eyes, it's deceitful

And I tried to use my heart and they hurt it
And I tried to do my part, I ain't perfect
I should've listened up when everybody said, "Don't fuck with everybody"
'Cause I gave you my heart, you ain't deserve it
And I tried to use my heart and they hurt it
And I tried to do my part, I ain't perfect
I should've listened up when everybody said, "Don't fuck with everybody" (Huh, huh)
'Cause I gave you my heart, you ain't deserve it

They got me like fuck a team (Team), and fuck a friend (Yeah)
'Cause they don't fuck with me (Me), the way I fuck with them (Yeah)
Who the fuck was there when you was fucked up with them?
Just seen my partner go outside and I can't be like him (Yeah, yeah)
So she gotta know how to ride (Hey), I ride around with a riot
I put in my work in with the time (Hey), I put that on God, yeah (Hey)
My name gon' speak (My name gon' speak), the gang gon' eat (Eat, eat)
I'm sorry I got in ya ride (Yeah), the tank on E (Skrrt)
You ain't gonna be pushing (Pushing, pushing), I looked down, you was looking (Yeah, yeah)
Thought you was a hundred (Yeah, yeah), but I found out you was wolfing (Hey, hey)
I don't give a fuck what they think (Hey)
They don't really love you they fake (Yeah)
The love always turn into hate (Hey)
The love always turn into hate

And I tried to use my heart and they hurt it
And I tried to do my part, I ain't perfect
I should've listened up when everybody said, "Don't fuck with everybody"
'Cause I gave you my heart, you ain't deserve it
And I tried to use my heart and they hurt it
And I tried to do my part, I ain't perfect
I should've listened up when everybody said, "Don't fuck with everybody" (Huh, huh)
'Cause I gave you my heart, you ain't deserve it

I tried to use my heart and they hurt it
And I tried to do my part, I ain't perfect
I should've listened up when everybody said, "Don't fuck with everybody"
'Cause I gave you my heart, you ain't deserve it
