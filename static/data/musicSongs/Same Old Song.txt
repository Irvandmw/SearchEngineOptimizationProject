[The Weeknd:]
Where were you when I needed you, eight months ago
All your girlfriends talkin' bout me, now you ringin' up my phone
Bet you miss me now baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun

You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby, I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right

You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

And now I'm poppin' yea
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin' yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you girl
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well you can take another shot everytime you hear me playin' in the club

You never thought that I would ever go this far
(never thought I'd go this far I made it)
You said potential could never last this long
(you never thought it could last so long)
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
(I been alone for most of my life)
What makes you think that you can ever do me right

You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

[Juicy J:]
Listen to that shit man
The Weeknd's music makes ladies panties get wet
Jam that shit my nigga
I'm high as a motherfucker
I don't give a shit
I'm going to the strip club, I'm throwing 30,000 dollars nigga, 30,000
Fuck that shit
Spend that shit nigga, it's Christmas
Shut the fuck up
We trippy mane
