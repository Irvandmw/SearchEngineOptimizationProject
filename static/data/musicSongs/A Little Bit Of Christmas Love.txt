Lyrics:


I don't want much
I just want a little bit
I don't want it all
I just want a little bit
Just an eeny weeny bit
A little bit of Christmas love

I don't want much
I just want a little bit
I don't want it all
I just want a little bit
Just an eeny weeny bit
A teeny bit of Christmas love

I don't want much
I just want a little bit
But I don't want it all
I just want a little bit
Just an eeny weeny bit
A teeny bit of Christmas love
