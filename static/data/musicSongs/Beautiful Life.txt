Lyrics:


I was lost, but you found me
Hiding in the shadows from my destiny
And you saw things that no one else could see
You saved me when I was my worst enemy

It feels so good to be alive
Just you and me tonight
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life
I heard your heart call mine
And then all the stars aligned
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life

Spread through me like a wild flame
I feel it in my veins
I'll never ever be the same
I'll never be the same
Cheers to the thing money can't buy
Can't buy what I feel inside
This thing, I can't deny
Our pretty little paradise

It feels so good to be alive
Just you and me tonight
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life
I heard your heart call mine
And then all the stars aligned
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life

Whoa-oo-oh
Whoa-oo-oh
Whoa-oo-oh
What a beautiful life

What a beautiful, what a beautiful, what a beautiful life
What a beautiful, what a beautiful, what a beautiful life
What a beautiful, what a beautiful, what a beautiful life
What a beautiful, what a beautiful, what a beautiful life

It feels so good to be alive
Just you and me tonight
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life
I heard your heart call mine
And then all the stars aligned
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life
