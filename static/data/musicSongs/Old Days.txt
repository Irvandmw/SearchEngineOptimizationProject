Lyrics:


Old days, good times I remember
Fun days filled with simple pleasures
Drive-in movies, comic books and blue jeans
Howdy doody, baseball cards and birthdays
Take me back to a world gone away
Memories seem like yesterday

Oh, old days, good times I remember
Gold days, days I'll always treasure
Funny faces full of love and laughter
Funny places, summer nights and streetcars
Take me back to a world gone away
Boyhood memories seem like yesterday

(Old days)
In my mind and in my heart to stay
(Old days)
Darkened dreams of good times gone away

(Old days)
Days of love and feeling fancy free
(Old days)
Days of magic still so close to me

(Old days)
In my mind and in my heart to stay
(Old days)
Darkened dreams of good times gone away

(Old days)
Days of love and feeling fancy free
(Old days)
Days of magic still so close to me
