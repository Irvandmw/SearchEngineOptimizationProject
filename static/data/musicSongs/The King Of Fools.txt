Song Name: The King Of Fools
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


She was so good
She was so kind
She made my life
A royal story
I was her king
She was my queen
We lived our life
In all its glory

Then just like Ulysses
I heard the witches cry
I lost my direction
But still I don't know why

I lost your love
My crown and jewels
When they call my name
They call me king
The king of fools

I played my song
And I made her cry
Though I was old
She made me younger
I buried decades of my life
To feel her youth
And feed my hunger

Now castles and mansion
Lie ruined in the sand
People laugh and mock me
Who once obeyed commands

I lost your love
My crown and jewels
When they call my name
They call me king
The king of fools

Only fools know what it's like
To lose and never win
Only fools have broken hearts
Over and over again

So here I am
Alone and weak
With all my powers
Vastly diminished
I think of you
Oh, by the hour
I know my royal life is finished

I know that I'm pathetic
'Cause I will always be your clown
You have found another
And he now wears my crown

I lost your love
My crown and jewels
When they call my name
They call me king
The king of fools

When they call my name
They call me king
The king of fools
