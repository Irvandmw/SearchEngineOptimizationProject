Lyrics:


I can't imagine what it would have been like,
If I'd have died in that car,
Later on that night.
But thank God 'cause I'm still right here,
I'm still living the dream
And facing up to my fear.

Well I knew it before,
I even walked through the door,
That things would be just fine.
And I don't wanna think about,
The ways it could be turning out...
I'll never leave this sign.

Come on,
Don't let go,
I can't get through this I know.
We'll stay strong,
And push on,
'Til I can't take it anymore.
My friends 'til the end,
Don't even wanna say goodbye...

I'm feeling lucky just being alive,
I-88 was against me,
But an angel was by my side.
And now I see it all in a different way,
I see the road ahead,
The start of a brand new day.

And I knew it before,
I even walked through the door,
That things would be just fine.
And I don't wanna think about,
The ways it could be turning out.
I'll never leave this sign.

Come on,
Don't let go,
I can't get through this I know.
I'll stay strong,
And push on,
'Til I can't take it anymore.
My friends 'til the end,
Don't ever wanna say goodbye...
And I don't ever wanna die.

Or even come this close....anymore.

Come on,
Don't let go,
I can't get through this I know.
We'll stay strong,
And push on,
'Til I can't take it anymore.
My friends 'til the end,
Don't ever wanna say goodbye...
