Lyrics:


I will be gay, if the gay are burned
I'll be Africa, if Africa is shut down
I will be poor, if the poor are humiliated
And I'll be a child, if the children are exploited

I know what I am and I know what I'm not

O mundo Ã© selvagem
O caminho Ã© solitÃ¡rio (Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©)
O mundo Ã© selvagem
O caminho Ã© solitÃ¡rio
Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©
(Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©)
(Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©)
(Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©)

I'll be Islam, if Islam is hated
I'll be Israel, if they're incarcerated
I'll be Native Indian, if the Indian has been taken
I'll be a woman, if she's raped and her heart is breaking

I know what I am (God knows what I am)
And I know what I'm not (And He knows what I'm not)
Do you know who you are?
Will we know when to stop?

O mundo Ã© selvagem
O caminho Ã© solitÃ¡rio (Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©)
O mundo Ã© selvagem
O caminho Ã© solitÃ¡rio
Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©

Eu jÃ¡ sei o que sou
E o que nÃ£o sou (Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©)
Eu sei o que sou
E o que nÃ£o sou (Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©)
O mundo (Wild is the world)
Wild is the world (Ã selvagem)
Wild is the world (Ã, Ã©, Ã©, Ã©)

I know what I am (God knows what I am)
And I know what I'm not (And He knows what I'm not)
Do you know who you are?
Will we know when to stop?

Wild is the world
And lonely is the path
To come to you...
