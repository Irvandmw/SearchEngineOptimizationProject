[Young Thug & Future:]
Pluto, King Slime

I'm in the Rolls, the one with the stars

Tie, tie my shoes, tie my tie tie my shoes
Tie tie my shoes, tie my tie tie my shoes
I pay my dues, I bick back, I be bool (I be bool)
I don't care about you enough to tell the, tell the truth
Yeah, I'm in the Rolls the one with the stars (zoom)
Yeah, I got a clean up crew for the blogs
Yeah, you gotta keep that shit cooler than sharks
Yeah yeah you wanna be slime you gotta shoot at your door yeah

[Young Thug:]
I scored first place but didn't get me no medal (yeah)

I'm bout to WCW your daughter your Grandma (yeah)
Money on top of the counter, just pop all the tags off
Money on top of the counter just pop all the tags off please
I made a oath thank God that my kids won't never need
Babe I'm sorry I text you back a week later (sorry)
I'm a humble dog like Dion Waiters

[Young Thug & Future:]
Tie tie my shoes, tie tie my shoes (lets go)
Tie tie my shoes, tie tie my shoes (lets go)
Tie tie my shoes, tie tie my shoes (yeah)
Tie tie my shoes, tie tie my shoes (skrr skrr)

[Future:]
I was leaning on Actavis, then poured the Red up (yeah)
I was smoking the kush she givin the head up (yeah)
Flooded the rollie with crushed ice and bezels
Shoot at your dog (tie my shoes)
King Slime Pluto sniping your broad (tie my shoes)
Dressed in Burberry came with Gucci (tie my shoes)
Michael Kors now they Pucci (tie my shoes)
Two Maybach Benz
Got a car dealership, got my trappers a scholarship
I did the seats Louis, custom made
I hang with criminals fresh out the cage
60 seconds I'm gone Nicholas Cage nigga (yeah)
I'm in the Phantom the one with the stars (swerve swerve)
If you ride with me gotta take a charge (lets go)
Got a .223 I could pull it apart (slatt)
23 freaks, slide like Jordan
Honest nigga, Gucci slippers I don't run from niggas (Future)
Average nigga, I retire strippers, fire strippers
Then I went and hide a stripper

[Young Thug & Future:]
Tie tie my shoes, tie tie my shoes
Tie tie my shoes, tie tie my shoes
I pay my dues, I bick back, I be bool
I don't care about you enough to tell the, tell the truth
Yeah, I'm in the Rolls the one with the stars (zoom)
Too clean for the blogs
Yeah, you gotta keep that shit cooler than sharks
Yeah yeah wanna be slime you gotta shoot at your dog yeah

[Future:]
