Lyrics:


Feel so good, like I knew you would
Come on let me hold you
Come on let me kiss you
Let me show you what you've been missin'
'Cause I feel so good
Now that you've come back home

Feel so fine, little girl now you're mine
Come on let me hold you
Come on let me kiss you
Come let me see what I've been missin'
'Cause I feel so fine
Now that you've come back home

It's been so long
Since you've been gone
Now I know you can see
How I want it to be

Feel so fine, little girl now you're mine
Come on let me hold you
Come on let me kiss you
Come let me see what I've been missin'
'Cause I feel so good
Now that you've come back home

It's been so long
Since you've been gone
Now I know you can see
How I want it to be

Feel so good, just like I know you would
Come on let me hold you
Come on let me kiss you
Let me show you what you've been missin'
'Cause I feel so good
Now that you've come back home

Feel so good, yeah, now that you've come back home
Well it feels so good, now that you've come back home
