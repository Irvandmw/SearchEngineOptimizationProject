Lyrics:


[Ella Eyre:]
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be waking up at someone else's place
I know I drink too much, can't pay my rent this month
I should be saving up, but

I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're goin'
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're goin'
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
I just got paid

[Meghan Trainor:]
And it feels like every day's a holiday
So I can take my check to the bank
And I know, know, know I should be worried
But I work, work, work to the bone, baby
So gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (woo)
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (hey)
Gimme that money
I said, now, gimme that money (oh, woah)
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (oh, yeah)
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Come on and gimme that money
Gimme that money

[Ella Eyre:]
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be waking up at someone else's place
I know I drink too much, can't pay my rent this month
I should be saving up, but

I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're goin'
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're goin'
We go in when we go out
I just got paid

[French Montana:]
Montana, yeah
La-di-da-di, we like to party
Don't cause trouble, don't bother nobody
La-di-da-di, woke up in the party
Sports bra, sports car driver
Showin' up, show out, bow in, bow out
Go in, go out, Ciroc, we pull off
I got more diamonds, ladies be the finest
Crush grapes, we don't do the wine
Crush denim, top spinning, cool bean, front grilling
Got paid, hop the G5 faded
Rotate shelties, wavy like a sailboat
When you hear the haaa, there it go
Montana with the funky sound
Sigala got the London sound

[Ella Eyre:]
I should grow up, they say
Stuck in my glory days
I know there's nothing wrong, it's just a passing phase
And when I've had my fun, I swear I'll be someone
I know that day will come, but

I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're goin'
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're goin'
We go in when we go out
I just got paid

[Meghan Trainor:]
Come on, say
[Ella Eyre:]
I just got paid
Yeah yeah, oh oh
I just got paid
[Meghan Trainor:]
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Gimme that money, gimme that money
[Ella Eyre:]
I just got paid
[Meghan Trainor:]
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Gimme that money, gimme that money
[Ella Eyre:]
I just got paid
