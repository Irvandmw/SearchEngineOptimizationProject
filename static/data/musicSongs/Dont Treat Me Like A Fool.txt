Lyrics:


It's been hard wakin' up, wakin' up to the truth.
I've been so blind, couldn't see for love. No.
Tried my best to ignore it, wish the pain away,
But just like tomorrow, it's coming round again.

So, darling, please don't treat me like a fool.
It's been hard enough for me, getting over you
So, darling, please don't treat me like you do
I'll be damned if I am gonna let ya,
Damned if I don't forget ya.
So, please don't treat me like a fool.

Thought I gave you the best, but it wasn't enough.
You took advantage of my trusting heart.
Tried my best to forgive you, did my best to forget.
I am done with the tears, and there are no regrets.

So, darling, please don't treat me like a fool.
It's been hard enough for me, getting over you
So, darling, please don't treat me like you do.
(Listen to me, baby.)
I'll be damned if I am gonna let ya,
Damned if I don't forget ya.

I know I'll be reaching out to touch you in the night,
Holding on to the memories, 'cause you're not here to hold me tight.
You lied when you told me it hurt to be apart
When all the lying you're doing is in someone else's arms.

Please don't treat me like a fool. No, no.
It's been hard enough for me, getting over you
So, darling, please don't treat me like you do.
(Don't you treat me like a fool.)
I'll be damned if I am gonna let ya,
Damned if I don't forget ya.
So, please don't treat me like a fool.
