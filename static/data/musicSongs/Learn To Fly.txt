Lyrics:


[Surfaces:]
All the broken people, put your hands up high
If you lift them up you might just touch the sky
All the lonely people, put your hands up high
If you loosen up you might just learn to fly

All the highs and the lows and the way it all goes
You can't let them keep you down
If you're lost, if you're broke, if you're stuck on a road
You can turn it all around

'Cause we gotta trust in love
Something that can't be touched
A feeling to lift us up
All in the name of love

All the broken people, put your hands up high
If you lift them up you might just touch the sky
All the lonely people, put your hands up high
If you loosen up you might just learn to fly

Learn to fly
Learn to fly
Learn to fly
Learn to fly

[Elton John:]
Sometimes it gets difficult
When everything's the same
You toss and turn
Push and pull
You don't know who to blame
But there is always something to hold on to in your life
Just keep that head up, don't you worry
It will be alright

[Surfaces:]
All the broken people, put your hands up high
If you lift them up you might just touch the sky
All the lonely people, put your hands up high
If you loosen up you might just learn to fly

All the broken people, put your hands up high
If you lift them up you might just touch the sky
All the lonely people, put your hands up high
If you loosen up you might just learn to fly

Learn to fly
Learn to fly
Learn to fly
