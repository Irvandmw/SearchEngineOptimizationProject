Lyrics:


Here I am in L.A. and L.A.'s been bringin' me down
I only have but one reason mama, for stayin' here in this old town
The air I'm breathin' is heavy, and you've been out sneakin' around
It may be rainin' in Tulsa child, but if you need me that's where I'll be found

I'm dreamin' of wild nights in Tulsa
Old nights out on the town
Dramin' of wild nights in Tulsa
Tulsa won't let me down

I dreamed I left old L.A., left it for the highway sound
I can't wait to get back home, Tulsa used to be my town
I slid into Junior's place to fix myself a couple of brews
I settled back in a big soft chair and put my lovin' arms around you

I'm dreamin' of wild nights in Tulsa
Old nights out on the town
Dramin' of wild nights in Tulsa
Tulsa won't let me down

I woke up from a deep sleep, thinkin' about how long I've been gone
It's sure nice to think about you, Tulsa is the place I was born
I remember the good times, and now I'm gonna make it last
Yes I'm finally gonna get back home, do some catchin' up with the past

I'm dreamin' of wild nights in Tulsa
Old nights out on the town
Dramin' of wild nights in Tulsa
Tulsa won't let me down

I'm dreamin' of wild nights in Tulsa
Old nights out on the town
Dramin' of wild nights in Tulsa
Tulsa won't let me down
