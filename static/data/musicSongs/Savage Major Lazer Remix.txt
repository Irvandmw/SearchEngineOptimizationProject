Lyrics:


I'm that bitch
Been that bitch, still that bitch (ah)
Will forever be that bitch
Aye, ah

I'm the hood Mona Lisa, break a nigga into pieces
Had to exit cheesy niggas out my circle like a pizza
I'm way too exclusive
Ion shop on Insta boutiques
All them lil ass clothes only fit fake booties
Bad bitch, still talking cash shit
Pussy like water, I'm unbothered and relaxing
I would never trip on a nigga, if I had him
Bitch that's my trash, you the maid so you bagged him (ah)

I'm a savage
Classy, boujee, ratchet
Sassy, moody, nasty (yeah)
Acting stupid, what's happening
Bitch, what's happening

Bitch, I'm a savage (yeah)
Classy, boujee, ratchet
Sassy, moody, nasty (yeah)
Acting stupid, what's happening
Bitch, what's happening
Aye, Ah

Eat me and record it but your edge up all I'm showing
I keep my niggas private, so his ap all I'm showing
Beefing with you bitches, really getting kinda boring
If it ain't about the money, then you know I'm gon ignore it
I'm the shit, aye
I need a mop to clean the floor, it's too much drip, oh
I keep a knot, I keep a watch, I keep a whip, oh
Let's play a game, simon says I'm still that bitch
Aye, I'm still that bitch

I'm a savage
Classy, boujie, ratchet
Sassy, mood, nasty (yeah)
Acting stupid, what's happening
Bitch, what's happening

Bitch, I'm a savage (yeah)
Classy, boujie, ratchet
Sassy, mood, nasty (yeah)
Acting stupid, what's happening
Bitch, what's happening
Aye, Ah

Bitch I'm lit like a match, oh
And any nigga I hit is still attatched, oh
That body right, but you know this pussy fat, oh
I drop a picture, and now these bitches feel attacked, aye
Don't let that nigga gas you up and get you wacked
I make a call and get a pussy nigga smacked oh
These bitches talking about pulling up, then where you at? oh
I'm in the lam bitch catch me if you can, oh
I'm kicking bitches out they spot Stalli-Chan, ah

Niggas say I taste like sugar, but ain't shit sweet, ah, muah
