Alright, yeah

If you know, you know I like that out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands up if you a out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey baby girl I like your accent, âcent, âcent
I think I like you more because you're different, âferent, âferent, âferent
Oh, I ain't gotta ask I can tell you ain't from here, here, here, here
Oh, what I gotta do just to show you that I want you near, near, near, near, near

All you gotta do is read the signs
The exit is to the right,
I don't know your name
But love your smile,
I love the way you put it down, down, down, down

If you know, you know I like that out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands up if you a out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I gotta hold it down for my out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can tell, you can tell, she's a out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you feeling me, let me know, we gon' ride the flow-ow-ow
I could be your passport, tell me where you wanna go-oh-oh
Girl, don't be shy. You won't know if you never try-try-try
When you walk by you're the only one that catches my eye, eye, eye

All you gotta do is read the signs
The exit is to the right,
I don't know your name
But love your smile,
I love the way you put it down, down, down, down

If you know, you know I like that out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands up if you a out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I gotta hold it down for my out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can tell, you can tell, she's a out-of-town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah

All you gotta do is swag

All you gotta do is swag, swag, swag, yeah
All you gotta do is swag
