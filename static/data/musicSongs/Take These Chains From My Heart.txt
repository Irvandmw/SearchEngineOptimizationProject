Lyrics:


Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in love is gone
But the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new
Let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
