Lyrics:


Oh oh oh letâs go

My Fender Strat sits all alone
Collecting dust in the corner
I havenât called any of my friends
Iâve been MIA since last December

My blackberryâs filled up with E-mail
My phone calls goes straight through to voice mail

'Cause on the street, or under the covers
We're stuck like two pieces of Velcro
At the park, in the back of my car
It donât matter what I do,
No, I canât keep my hands off you
(canât keep my, canât keep my)
Canât keep my hands off you
(canât keep my, canât keep my)

Thereâs fungus growing in the icebox
All I got left are Fruit Roll-Ups
My clothes are six months old
But I donât care, no, no, no, I donât notice

My bills pile is so high, it is shocking
The repo man just keeps on knocking

'Cause on the street, or under the covers
We're stuck like two pieces of Velcro
At the park, in the back of my car
It donât matter what I do,
No, I canât keep my hands off you
(canât keep my, canât keep my)
Canât keep my hands off you
(canât keep my, canât keep my)
Canât keep my hands off you

Sorry to all my friends and to anyone I offend
But I canât help it, no, I canât help it

Canât keep my, canât keep my (canât keep my hands off you)
Canât keep my, canât keep my (canât keep my hands off you)
Canât keep my, canât keep my (canât keep my hands off you)
Canât keep my, canât keep my (canât keep my hands off you)

'Cause on the street, or under the covers
We're stuck like two pieces of Velcro (stuck like two pieces of Velcro)
At the park, in the back of my car
It donât matter what I do,
No, I canât keep my hands off you
(canât keep my, i canât keep my)
I Canât keep my hands off you
(canât keep my, I canât keep my)
I Canât keep my hands off you
(canât keep my, I canât keep my)
I can't keep my hands off you
(canât keep my, i canât keep my)
I can't keep my hands off you
