Lyrics:


You're a beautiful boy,
With all your little toys,
Your eyes have seen the world,
Though your only four years old,
And your tears are streaming,
Even when your smiling,
Please never be afraid to cry,

You're a beautiful boy,
With all your little ploys,
Your mind has changed the world,
And your now forty years old,
You got all you can carry,
And still somehow empty,
Don't ever be afraid to fly,

All you beautiful boys,
Creating multiple plays,
You like to fence in your world,
And settle down when you're old,
You can run from pole to pole,
And never scratch your soul,
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
Don't be afraid to be afraid.
