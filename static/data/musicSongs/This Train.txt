Lyrics:


This train I ride is movin'
It's rolling down the line, yeah, yeah
Can't you feel it
It's comin' in on time

I'm leaving Colorado
Riding on a cloud, now, now
Over mountain tops and feeling might proud

It's been a long time since I held you close to me
Singing songs and makin' love is where I wanna be, yeah

So long Carson City
I'll be back someday, yeah yeah,
This train I'm ridin' has got the right of way

I can hardly wait till I hold you close to me
Singing songs and makin' love is where I wanna be, yeah

This train I ride is movin'
It's rolling down the line, now, now
Can't you feel it
It's comin' in on time
