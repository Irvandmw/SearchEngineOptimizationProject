Lyrics:


Mama Goes Where Papa Goes
Or Papa don't go out tonight
Mama goes 'cause Mama knows
He can't be trusted out of her sight
Mama's got a feelin' that she must be near
Just to help her Papa keep his conscience clear
So Mama Goes Where Papa Goes
Or Papa don't go out tonight!
No, Papa don't go out tonight!

Here's your bedroom slippers and your fav'rite pipe
Here's your yellow bathrobe with the purple stripe
Here's your armchair and the paper that you read
And here's the lovin' mama
Who's got everything you need
I've had plenty, Daddy, and you ain't the worst
But your Mama here believes in safety first
And any married woman will admit I'm right
A husband in the home is worth a dozen out of sight!

Mama's got a feelin' that she must be near
Just to help her Papa keep his conscience clear
So, Mama Goes Where Papa Goes
Or Papa don't go out tonight,
No, Papa don't go out tonight!
