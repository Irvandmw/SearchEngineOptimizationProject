Lyrics:


Oh I, I don't waste my time with bullshit
I'm on my own shit, yeah
And I, I'm not the only one to notice
You can't control it, no

You love, you love, you love, you love yourself too much, aye
You talk, you talk, you talk, you talk, you won't shut up

If you could keep my name out your mouth
Take that hate off your tongue
And drop that drama you won't
Why don't you just say it to my face?
I'm gonna give you something to talk about (oh)
Oh I, I'm gonna give you something to talk about
Oh I, go 'head, just say it to my face (aye-yeah)
I'm gonna give you something to talk about, oh

Hey, mmm

Oh I, I don't need your validation
It's overrated yeah
And why, oh why you so frustrated?
It makes you basic, eh

You love, you love, you love, you love yourself too much, aye (too much, too much)
You talk, you talk, you talk, you talk, you won't shut up

If you could keep my name out your mouth
Take that hate off your tongue
And drop that drama you won't
Why don't you just say it to my face?
I'm gonna give you something to talk about (oh)
Oh I, I'm gonna give you something to talk about
Oh I, go 'head, just say it to my face
I'm gonna give you something to talk about, oh

If you could keep my name out your mouth
Take that hate off your tongue
And drop that drama you won't
Why don't you just say it to my face?
I'm gonna give you something to talk about (oh)
Oh I, I'm gonna give you something to talk about
Oh I, go 'head, just say it to my face
I'm gonna give you something to talk about, oh (oh-oh)

I'm gonna give you something to talk about, oh
I'm gonna give you something to talk about, oh
Just say it to my face
And I'm gonna give you something to talk about, oh
