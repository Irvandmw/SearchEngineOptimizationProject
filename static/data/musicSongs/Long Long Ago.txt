Lyrics:


[Nat] Long long ago
[Both] Long long ago
[Both] Long long ago
[Dean] Well they say it was better in oh so many ways
[Both] Long long ago, long ago

[Both] They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
[Nat] And on a very cold and wintery night
[Nat] They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight
[Both] And when the summer came
[Both] They will have to take a dame all bundled up to the beach
[Dean] They didn't know a girl could look so cute
[Dean] In a bikini suit

[Nat] Oh how they sing of the good, good old days
[Both] Long long ago
[Both] Long long ago
[Dean] They couldn't swing in the good old days
[Both] Long long ago, long ago

{At same time}
[Nat] They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
[Dean] But they still talk of the good, good old days
[Nat] And on a very cold and wintery night
[Dean] Long long ago
[Nat] They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight
[Dean] Long long ago
[Nat] So when people say to me "nothings like it used to be"
[Nat] I don't believe that it's so
[Dean] They say it was better in so many ways
[Nat] They didn't have so much to brag about
[Dean] Long long ago, long ago
[Nat] Long long ago
[Both] Long long ago
[Both] Long long ago
