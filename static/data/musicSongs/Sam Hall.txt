Lyrics:


Alright, everyone out there can kiss myâha, ha, ha

Well, my name it is Sam Hall, it is Sam Hall.
Yes, my name it is Sam Hall; it is Sam Hall.
My name it is Sam Hall
And I hate you, one and all.
Yeah, I hate you, one and all:
'Til I blame your eyes.

I killed a man, they said; so they said.
Killed a man, they said; so they said.
Killed a man, they said
And I smashed in his head.
And I left him layin' dead,
Well, darn his head.

A-swingin' I must go; I must go.
A-swingin' I must go; I must go.
Swingin' I must go
While you critters down below
Yell up, "Sam, I told you so."
Well, blast your head!

I saw Molly in the crowd; in the crowd.
I seen Molly in the crowd; in the crowd.
There was Molly in the crowd
And I hollered right out loud,
"Hey there, Molly, ain't you proud?
Well, damn your eyes."

My name it is Sam Hall, it is Sam Hall.
Yeah, my name it is Sam Hall; it is Sam Hall.
Yeah, my name it is Sam Hall
And I hate you, one and all.
And I hate you, one and all:
Darn your head

Then the Sheriff, he come to; he come to.
Yeah, the Sheriff, he come to; he come to.
Oh, The Sheriff, he come to
He said, "well, how are you?"
And I said, "Well, Sheriff, how are _you_?
Darn your head."

Call my name it is Sam Hall, it is Sam Hall.
My name it is Sam Hall; it is Sam Hall.
Yeah, my name it is Sam Hall
And I hate you, one and all.
And I hate you, one and all:
Blast your eyes

My name is Samuel, Samuel, Samuel.
My name is Samuel, Samuel.
Yeah, my name is Samuel,
And I'll see you all in well.
My name is Samuel,
Blast your eyes

My name is Samuel Hall
Blast your eyes
Blame your head
Darn your eyes
