Lyrics:


I want what I can't have
Still holding onto hope
Drowning in my tears
This love's a sinking boat
Oh-oh, oh-oh
This love's a sinking boat
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Once my hands have reached the shore
You pull me back in
And I shouldn't beg for more
But I don't want it to end

Just take me like a wave (wave, wave, wave) oh-oh (wave)
Take me like a wave (wave, wave) oh-oh-oh (wave, wave)
Take me like a wave, pull me back and forth
Crash into my arms, tell me I am yours
Take me like a wave (wave, wave) oh-oh-oh (wave) ah-ah (wave)

Headed to surface, I'll keep you afloat
I'll keep you safe, babe (safe, yuh-yuh)
Right in the middle of heaven and hell
This world was made for us (yeah)
Don't blame you at all (ah)
It was all my fault (yeah)
I swear that I won't do the shit that I did before
I'm too scared to walk away (yeah)
I need you back with me (hey)
I think it's all the same for you, yeah
I just wanna kiss your neck
'Cause I miss the way you're dancing on me, yeah
Lemme pull ya back in (yeah)

Once my hands have reached the shore
You pull me back in
And I shouldn't beg for more
But I don't want it to end

Just take me like a wave (wave, wave, wave) oh-oh (wave)
Take me like a wave (wave, wave) oh-oh-oh (wave, wave)
Take me like a wave, pull me back and forth
Crash into my arms, tell me I am yours
Take me like a wave (wave, wave) oh-oh-oh (wave) ah-ah (wave)

(Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh)
