Lyrics:


Do I want you? 
Oh my! Do I! 
Honey, deed I do! 

Do I need you? 
Oh my! Do I! 
Honey, deed I do! 

I'm glad that I'm the one who found you, 
That's why I'm always hangin' around you... 

Do I love you? 
Oh my! Do I! 
Honey, deed I do! 

[instrumental repeat of verse]

Honey, deed I do! 

[instrumental repeat of verse]

Hmm! Honey, deed I do! 
I'm glad that I'm the one who found you, 
That's why I'm always hangin' around you... 

Oh! Do I love you? 
Oh my! Do I! 
Honey, deed I do! 

Ah Deed I Do!
