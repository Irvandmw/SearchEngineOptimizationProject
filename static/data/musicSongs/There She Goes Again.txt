Lyrics:


When she holds on to me 
Itâs clear to see, 
Itâs difficult.
(Didnât I know it)

First time Iâve chosen to open up, 
Not broken up 
Itâs typical.
(Didnât I know it)

For all the reasons Iâve told myself 
âFind something elseâ
Sheâs serious
(Didnât I know it)

All the heartfelt words we found
Iâm coming âround
Theyâre meaningless
(Didnât I know it) 

Wo-oah

[Chorus]
Sheâs taken what she wants
But she wants everything
There she goes, there she goes
Well there she goes again

Knows how to turn it on
Yeah but not for long
Itâs physical, physical
Then it donât mean a thing

I know better than to think
Sheâs standing still
Dressed to kill
Well there she goes again

How many hearts that she thrown aside?
So finding mine
Should be no surprise
(Didnât I know it)

I needed her like she knew I would
And it hurt so good
Sheâs satisfied
(Didnât I know it)

It means nothing to hold or kiss 
âCause sheâs done this
A thousand times

Wo-oah

[Chorus]

I know better than to think
Sheâs standing still
Just to thrill
Well there she goes again

Wo-oah
Wo-oah

There she goes again
There she goes again
Didnât I know

[Chorus]

I know better than to think
Sheâs standing still
Just to thrill
Didnât I know

[Chorus]

I know better than to think
Sheâs standing still
Just to thrill
Well there she goes again.
