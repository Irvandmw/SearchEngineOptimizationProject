Lyrics:


Someone, be my witness that she walked away,
Said I said things that I didn't say,
Broke my heart and said,
She don't love me, she don't love me.
And someone, woohoo, see the side of her that I can see,
How all she is is just a fantasy,
Damn my pride and said,
She don't love me, she don't love me, 

Watch as she goes, past Hollywood Bowl,
La Cienega cries, as she passes by,
Her ex-lovers claim, it was different for them,
She's leaving a trail of broken hearts.

Curtains will close at the Hollywood Bowl,
The pain that she hides, is in black and white, 
She said, baby it's hard, when you burn like a star, 
She's leaving a trail of broken hea-a-a-a-arts. 

Someone, someone else will know I tell the truth,
The trail of hearts is all you need for proof, 
I'm not the first who's heard,
She don't love them, she don't love them,
And sometimes, woohoo, sometimes I wish that I could see her again, 
Oh god it hurt but she was beautiful when, 
She held my hand and said,
She don't love me, she don't love me, 

Watch as she goes, past Hollywood Bowl,
La Cienega cries, as she passes by,
Her ex-lovers claim, it was different for them,
She's leaving a trail of broken hearts.

Curtains will close at the Hollywood Bowl,
The pain that she hides, is in black and white, 
She said, baby it's hard, when you burn like a star, 
She's leaving a trail of broken hea-a-a-a-arts. 

There's nothing you can do about it.
There's nothing you can say...

Watch as she goes, past Hollywood Bowl,
La Cienega cries, as she passes by,
Her ex-lovers claim, it was different for them,
She's leaving a trail of broken hearts.

Curtains will close at the Hollywood Bowl,
The pain that she hides, is in black and white, 
She said, baby it's hard, when you burn like a star, 
She's leaving a trail of broken hea-a-a-a-arts. 

Woohoo, she said, baby it's hard, when you burn like a star, 
She's leaving a trail of broken hea-a-a-a-arts.
