Lyrics:


Let me know, let me know, ohhh ohhh
Let me know, let me know

[Drake:]
Yo, this is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havenât slept in days, and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways, so Iâm single
Thinking about what we had and missing you,
But I ainât Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out
Baby, donât hold on too long âcause thats how them stories start out,
And all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out, itâs Drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you canât escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, Iâm learning to behave,
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but Iâm good
I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle,
Iâm looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettinâ from where I came,
And no matter where Iâm headed, I promise to stay the same

[Chorus - Jeezy & Drake:]
Iâm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, Iâm the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters,
And when you get to talkinâ bout the greatest
I just really hope that (youâd think of me) [3x]
I'm doin my thing [3x]
(âCause Iâm trynna be unforgettable)

[Young Jeezy:]
This just might be my realest flow ever,
When I say for life, yâall say forever
Itâs hard, but its fair, I told that girl "Life hurts"
The closest you gonna get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The nameâs Young, baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young, so Iâmma need a thug wife
Yeah, Iâm talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry prolly louder than a car alarm
Yeah, Iâm in my "used to have to sneak the car"
Now my insides are lookin like a snickers bar
Yeah, Iâm talking caramel leathers,
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
She saying shit in them streets, so whats the deal?
And Iâve done everything in the A, but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life, no two days the same
Like for yâall to meet the love of my life, her nameâs the Game

[Chorus - Jeezy & Drake]

[Jeezy talking:]
Got this top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah,
Unforgettable, youâll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable

Let me know, let me know
