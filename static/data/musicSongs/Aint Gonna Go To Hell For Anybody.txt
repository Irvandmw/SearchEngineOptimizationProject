Lyrics:


Ain't gonna go to hell for anybody...

I can manipulate people as well as anybody.
Hold 'em and control 'em, squeeze 'em and tease 'em.
I can make believe I'm in love with almost anybody.
Force 'em and burn 'em, twist 'em and turn 'em.
All that satisfies the fleshy needs.
I've been down that road, I know what it needs.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not today, not tonight, not tomorrow, no never, no way!

I can persuade people as well as anybody.
I got the vision, but it caused division.
I can twist the truth as well as anybody.
I know how to do it, I've been all the way through it.
But it don't suit my purpose and it ain't my goal
to gain the whole world, but give up my soul.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not for father, not for mother, not for sister, not for brother, no way!

I can twist the truth around as well as anybody.
Wine 'em and dine 'em, fool 'em and rule 'em.
I can rob and steal from people as well as anybody.
I know how to do it, but it don't suit my purpose and it ain't my goal
to gain the whole world but give up my soul.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not for father, not for mother, not for sister, not for brother, no way!

Smoke arises for ever, on a one-way ticket to burn.
A place reserved for the devil
and for all those that done evil.
A place of darkness and shame, you can never return.

I can influence people as well as anybody.
I can cause division, can cause division.
I can mislead people as well as anybody.
Burn 'em and roll 'em, rob 'em and hold 'em.
Won't get my story in tricks or cards.
I can see through man's delusions, I can see through his facades.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not today, not tonight, not tomorrow, no never, no way!

I can write and steal from people as well as anybody.
Know all the devices, paid a lot of prices,
I can influence people as well as anybody.
Go right up to 'em, I know how to do 'em.
Don't need to depend on tricks or on cards.
I can see through man's delusions, I can see through his facades.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody,
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not today, not tonight, not tomorrow, no never, no way!
