Lyrics:


We ain't ever been the mother
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck

We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort
Just to show them that we better
Get the broads like that
It's how we do it!

Hey bitches
Uh, I know I can be a little bit much sometimes
But really I just do that shit for the fellas
You know, I rap for the fellas
But like, this is for y'all

I ain't even strong like that
So average, I ain't tall like that

We just trying to show a little respect
Maybe you go for it
I'm the one that you need and you just don't know it

We ain't never been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

Honestly I'm like a seven with my hair long
Maybe seven and a half facial hair strong
But I make these bitches laugh and I care for them
I'm the type of motherfucker pulling out the chair for them

I ain't ever been the g at the bar
That get them bitches hella wet just by seeing his arms
You know the boy about the leg work
I plant seeds, I'm a mexicano gardener

All I'm saying is I ain't playing the game with these bitches
I ain't mean to em, I prefer to show them everything that I can mean to them
Lil Dicky thrive with a friend of a friend and I never hesitate to tell them that I love Rent

I am not a stud I'm a boyfriend
I love love and I cuddle for enjoyment
My dick small but I'm telling you it's nothing by the time
That we fucking they so emotionally interested they really be cumming

Drinking champagne oh you trying to dance babe
We can hit the floor I'm bout to show you how to man shake
We can make a handshake
Keep you safe and walk you to your damn place
Then I got you bouncing on my rubber like a trampoline

What you doing tomorrow? I'm with it
I'm a take you to the zoo and be cordialant witty
I'm a tell you hella stories and be mindful
Bet you get a little horny like the infant rhinos

I ain't even strong like that
So average, I ain't tall like that

We just trying to show a little respect
Maybe you go for it
I'm the one that you need and you just don't know it

We ain't never been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

We ain't never been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

We ain't ever been the mother
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck

We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort
Just to show them that we better
Get the broads like that
It's how we do it!

When I get your gchat, that's a wrap hoe
Smoke weed, eat the pussy like a snack hoe
Bake lays, you on top like a wrap though
Bet you think I'm nice in person I ain't talking rap shows

I ain't gonna pick you up at the club
But if I get bout an hour with you, bet you in love
I'll ask questions

Oh you did your hair? Little Dicky pay attention
Oh you getting scared? What's the root of all this tension

You know I'd be a hell of a date and if you torn I will split the entrees that you crave
And when you bored I can send you Snapchats for days
And make them personally for you like they all will be based around the inside jokes we develop in time

And if you tired won't initiate the sex it's fine
I can talk you on the phone when you driving alone
And make you feel comfortable enough to take me to mom

And that bitch goin' love it
She goin' tell your ass you legit yo a hubby
She goin' tell your ass need to quit your clubbing and go get that youngun
While I'm sitting with your dad being slick straight grubbing

I can take you out to brunch call me hollandaise
Know exactly what you want every holiday

I can text you like a motherfucker
Wordy and impressive 57 on the Ketchup
Hit you when you coming through

I ain't even strong like that
So average, I ain't tall like that

We just trying to show a little respect
Maybe you go for it
I'm the one that you need and you just don't know it

We ain't ever been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

We ain't ever been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

We ain't ever been the mother
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck

We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort
Just to show them that we better
Get the broads like that
It's how we do it!
Lil Dicky...
T-Pain... We goin' get them hoes one day man
We goin' places
Like... together?
Not on a date, but we're goin' places (oh OK)
For instance, I saw this nice looking young lady that I was attracted to sexually in the grocery part of Target.
And I wanted to put my penis in her vagina, but I didn't tell her. And that, my friends, is the definition of a motherfucking gentleman!
