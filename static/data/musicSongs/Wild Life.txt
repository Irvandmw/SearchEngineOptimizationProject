Lyrics:


I was born with a ticket to survive
And a big dream in my head
Its a wild, wild life and there's no way to tame it
Or so my old man said
I knew in my heart that someday
The world would step aside
And try to see things my way
Now I know, the one thing I can count on
Is that I really can't count on anything.

[*] It's a wild life
Every roads a mean street
Its a wild life
All we do is ride
Its a wild life
And weve all just God to land on our feet

Livin my life, chasing love and glory
Runnin into walls of stone
Whether you fall or climb a hundred stories
Youve gotta do it all alone

[**] I feel like the world is calling
Ive got to move along
No reasons left for stalling
And if it's mine
Im gonna take it with a vengeance
Or maybe I better just take it as it comes

[* - repeat]

[** - repeat]
