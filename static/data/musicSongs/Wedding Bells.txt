Lyrics:


(Wedding bells, wedding bells.)

I have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
But I hope you're happy just the same.

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing now for you and me
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
So wedding bells will never ring for me.

I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I thought someday I'd place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold.

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing now for you and me
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
So wedding bells will never ring for me.

So wedding bells will never ring for me...
