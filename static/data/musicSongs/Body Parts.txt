Lyrics:


My heart was talking to my head
Said "I've loved once. I'll never love again"
And my head at this replied
"I'll miss her too. She was easy on the eyes"

And now all they do is look around for you
And every night with their lids closed tight
They're lost in dreams, that they'll awake and see
You lying next to me

My feet could feel it in their soles
We've gone too far, and we'll never make it home
And these hands, they felt the same
They held her once but they let her slip away

And now all I do is look around for you
And every night with my eyes closed tight
I'm lost in dreams, that I'll awake and see
You lying next to me

If there's one thing I've learned, it's how easy the tables turn
And if there's one thing I know, it's the fine art of letting go

My heart was talking to my head
Said "I've loved once. I'll never love again"

And now all I do is look around for you
And every night with my eyes closed tight
I'm lost in dreams, that I'll awake and see
You lying next to me
