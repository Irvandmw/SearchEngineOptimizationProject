Lyrics:


She's everything to everyone
wish I could have seen it come down,
but I heard incorrectly.
It seems everything she knows is now
five minutes too close and that's not
a lot of time when you're nervous.

And they say,
"Daughter, look away
don't be afraid
when you want to turn back a million times.
and it might get colder,
but wait 'til it's over.
Darling, you'll find your way.

And she said, "I
will not look away this time,
take all these cuts and make them shine.
And all this pain I've held inside,
so I can find my way home again.

I
will not look away this time,
take all these cuts and make them shine,
Don't wanna be perfect just alright.

He's on his way to nowhere
'Cause he heard it was safe there.
And safe is something valuable here.

He spent half his life searching
and the other half working
hard to find out if Jesus is real.

And they said, "Son look away
don't be afraid when you want to turn back a million times and it might get colder
but wait 'til it's over.
Son, you will find your way.

And I said, "I
will not look away this time.
Take all these cuts and make them shine,
and all this pain I've held inside
so I can find my way home again.

I
will not look away this time.
Take all these cuts and make them shine.
Don't want to be perfect just alright.

And every time
every line
every time
you want to say goodbye,
every time
every line
every time
you want to say goodbye

sing.
I
will not look away this time.
Take all these cuts and make them shine,
and all this pain I've held inside.
So I can find my way home again.

I
will not look away this time.
Take all these cuts and make them shine.
Don't wanna be perfect just alright.

She's everything to everyone
wish I could have seen it come down
but I heard it correctly,

it seems everything she knows is now
five minutes too close and that's not a lot of time when you're nervous.
