Lyrics:


When I was young, I thought the world of you
You were all that I wanted then
It faded and I never saw you again
But I won't forget the love we had

Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
Don't let me go
Stay with me still
I've missed you so

When I was young, I thought the world of you
I was dumb to let you drift away
And though I guess it had to come to an end
No one else could have the love we shared

Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
And my heart goes
Out to you
Wherever you are

Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
Don't let me go
Stay with me still
I've missed you so
