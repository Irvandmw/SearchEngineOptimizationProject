Lyrics:


Step one: I could be your man
You can call me daddy when we're fuckin' in the sand
Step two: Let's go for a ride, baby
Gotta hold the stick, I'll drive baby
Step three: I'll be in these streets
Throwing up the west side
Chucking up the peace
And they can't take away my pride
They just can't take away my pride
(Till they bury me)
Look into my eyes, and see what I see
You're a mind reader, it's just you and me

I'm ready to go to war for you
I'm 'a be a warrior, I'm 'a make sure you're safe with me
I be smoking that Cali
And baby me and you can fly
Think it over one more time
Yeah, just one more time

Yo I'm just a little nigga from a small town
I try to keep a small circle, 
But these fuck niggas always tryna come around
Bad bitches on deck, I'm about to bring em out
You niggas writing bad cheques
I make her booty bounce
15 years old I was riding in a Lamborghini
Now I'm 24, got a bigger fuckin' Lamborghini
Two doors up, like I'm two floors up
It's kill or be killed nigga
Either you or us
But I keep it moving like a U-haul truck
This adolescence, had me stressing, I was too fucked up, I'm gone
What's the point of you having a crown if you ain't got a throne
If you king you need a queen, I'm gone

Look into my eyes, and see what I see
You're a mind reader, it's just you and me

I'm ready to go to war for you
I'm 'a be a warrior, I'm 'a make sure you're safe with me
I be smoking that Cali
And baby me and you can fly
Think it over one more time
Just one more time

I just need you one more time
(Do it! Can we do it baby?) One more time
(Do it) One more time
One more time
Baby if we do it, it's gonna change our lives
It's kinda late get some sleep
I'll drive ya all around the world

I'm ready to go to war for you
I'm 'a be a warrior, I'm 'a make sure you're safe with me
I be smoking that Cali
And baby me and you can fly
Think it over one more time
Just one more time

I'm ready to go to war for you
I'm 'a be a warrior, I'm 'a make sure you're safe with me
I be smoking that Cali
And baby me and you can fly
Think it over one more time
Just one more time
