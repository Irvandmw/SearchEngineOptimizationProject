Lyrics:


The secret way you hold my hand
to let me know you understand
the wind and rain upon your face
the breathless world of your embrace
your little laugh and handsome cries
the star light gleaming in your eyes
remembering all those little things
all of a sudden my heart sings

All of a sudden my heart sings
when I remember little things
the way you dance and hold me tight
the way you kiss and say good night
the crazy things we say and do
the fun it is to be with you
the magic thrill that's in your touch
oh darling I love you so much

The secret way you hold my hand
to let me know you understand
the wind and rain upon your face
the breathless world of your embrace
your little laugh and handsome cries
the star light gleaming in your eyes
remembering all those things
all of a sudden my heart sings
