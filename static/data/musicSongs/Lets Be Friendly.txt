Lyrics:


Let's be friendly just the two of us
Can't afford to disappoint the moonlight
My what lovely scenery cupid's own machinery
Made to trap a nervous chap like me

Let's be friendly let's be discreet
Must I fight the feeling that I'm falling
Should we accidentally kiss I'd give up the fight
And we could move more than just good friends tonight

Should we accidentally kiss I'd give up the fight
And we could move more than just good friends tonight
