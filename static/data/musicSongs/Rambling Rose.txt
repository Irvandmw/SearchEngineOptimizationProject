Lyrics:


Everyone knows she's a rambling rose, she's a beauty growing wild
Birds in their nests seem to whistle their best
Mother Nature's favorite child
She's got that kind of affection that just winds around your heart
You'd better run for protection or she might upset your flower cart

Hate to disclose that my rambling rose is gonna meet her Waterloo
I'll let her play but she can't get away 'cause I know just what to do
Anyone knows you can train a rose to be a clinging vine
So from this day hence there'll be a picket fence round that rambling rose of mine

She's got that kind of affection that just winds around your heart
You'd better run for protection or she might upset your flower cart
Hate to disclose that my rambling rose is gonna meet her Waterloo
I'll let her play but she can't get away 'cause I know just what to do
Anyone knows you can train a rose to be a clinging vine
So from this day hence there'll be a picket fence round that rambling rose of mine
