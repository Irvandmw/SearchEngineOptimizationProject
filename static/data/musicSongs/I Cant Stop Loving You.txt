Lyrics:


I can't stop loving you, so I've made up my mind
To live in memory of old lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those happy hours, that we once knew
Though long ago, still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you, there's no use to try
Pretend there's someone new, I can't live a lie

I can't stop loving you, there's no use to try
Pretend there's someone new, I can't live a lie
I can't stop wanting you, the way that I do
There's only been one love for me
That one love is you
