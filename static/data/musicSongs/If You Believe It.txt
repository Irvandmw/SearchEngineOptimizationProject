Lyrics:


If you believe it, you really believe it
The Lord will smile upon you
If you believe it, really believe it
The Lord will smile upon you

You know he loves you, he really loves you
And he'll reward you with his blessings
If you believe it, really believe it
The Lord will smile upon you

Life can be just what you make it
The answer is all in your heart
So just let the Lord know you love him
Then he'll do his part

If you believe it, you really believe it
The Lord will smile upon you
If you believe it, really believe it
The Lord will smile upon you

Life can be just what you make it
The answer is all in your heart
So just let the Lord know you love him
Then he'll do his part

If you believe it, you really believe it
The Lord will smile upon you
If you believe it, really believe it
The Lord will smile upon you
The Lord will smile upon you
