Lyrics:


Is your burden heavy as you bear it all alone?
Does the road you travel, harbor dangers yet unknown?
Are you growin' weary in the struggle of it all?
Jesus will help you when on his name you call

He's always there hearing every prayer, faithful and true
Walking by our side, in his love we'll hide all the day through
When you get discouraged just remember what to do
Reach out to Jesus, he's reaching out to you

Is the life you're living filled with sorrow and despair?
Does the future press you with its worry and its care?
Are you tired and friendless, have you almost lost your way?
Jesus will help you, just call to him today

He's always there hearing every prayer, faithful and true
Walking by our side, in his love we'll hide all the day through
When you get discouraged just remember what to do
Reach out to Jesus,
Come on and reach out to Jesus,
I said reach out to Jesus,
He's reaching out to you
