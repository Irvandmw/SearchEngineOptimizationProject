Lyrics:


Oooh, I think I'm missing you
More than these other dudes
Baby, I'm on my toes
I'll never let you go
I've found ya and it's true
You know I'm diggin' you
You know I'm diggin' you
You know I'm diggin' you

It's that real shit, real shit
Fuck, how a hater gon' feel shit [x4]

Yeah
I think I'm missing you
More than these other dudes
Baby, I'm on my toes
I'll never let you go
I've found ya and it's true
You know I'm diggin' you
I'm diggin' you
You know I'm diggin' you
Diggin' You
Diggin' You
Diggin', I'm diggin', If you diggin'

Baby if you diggin' me we can kiss and touch and love on the weekend [x4]
