Lyrics:


I'm your Santa Claus
I'm gonna give you everything you wished for
This Christmas
I'm your Santa Claus, baby
Underneath the mistletoe
Kiss me, girl, never let me go

Walkin' in the fallin' snow
Christmas lights are all aglow
Bells will ring, children sing
Celebrate the joy they bring

I'm your Santa Claus
I'll give you everything you wish for
This Christmas
I'm your Santa Claus
There ain't nothin' I won't do
I'm gonna make your dreams come true

You're the one that I adore
No one in this world means more
A child is born, a star so bright
A promise made on Christmas night

This gift is silver and gold
This wish about to unfold
My love, to have and to hold
Forever

Merry Christmas, I love you

I'm your Santa Claus
I'll give you everything you wish for
This Christmas
I'm your Santa Claus, baby
Underneath the mistletoe
Kiss me, girl, never let me go

Christmas is here
And I know every year
You'll be here
In my heart, evermore

Merry Christmas, and I love you
I'm your Santa Claus, baby
Merry Christmas, yes I love you
Gonna party like it's Christmas all day long
Yeah
I'm your Santa Claus, baby

Merry Christmas, and I love you
I'm your Santa Claus, baby
Merry Christmas, yes I love you
Gonna party like it's Christmas all year long

Merry Christmas, and I love you
I'm your Santa Claus, baby
Merry Christmas, yes I love you
Gonna party like it's Christmas all year long
