Lyrics:


What now? Time has come
School's out, life's just begun
And everyone's tellin' me where to go.

I don't know what I should do
I feel trapped by all their rules
Get a chalk, get a lie, go back to school

But when I look up there
I dream up in the sky
I swear someday I'm gonna fly

I know I move it slow
But I wouldn't let anybody tell me so
'Cause they don't know it's where I'm trying to go

I know it'll be ok
'Cause I just wanna think about today
And everything that will come will go my way

But when I look up there
I dream up in the sky
I swear someday I'm gonna fly

I never knew that I could feel this way
I'd never thought that I'd see the day
Where I'll be happy on my own
Whoa

And everything was headed out alright
But they'll play it all through the night
That's not the way it's 'posed to go

What now? The time is right
Won't give up without putting up a fight
'Cause I know it's where I'm trying to go

I know when I make my move
This is a game I can't afford to lose
It's my life that I live the way I choose

But when I look up there
I dream up in the sky
I swear someday I'm gonna fly

I never knew that I could feel this way
I'd never thought that I'd see the day
Where I'll be happy on my own
Whoa

And everything was headed out alright
But they'll play it all through the night
That's not the way it's 'posed to go
