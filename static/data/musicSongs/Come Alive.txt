Lyrics:


I'm in the sky where I ought to be at, I've been watching you
Rocket ship takin' off and that, now I'm onto you
Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion, who you talkin' to?
Stand out, no, I don't wanna blend in, why you want me to?

They say be all I can be
And all I want is peace peace peace peace peace peace
See the world, haven't seen it all
I wanna see, see, see, see, see, see, see

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream, dream, it's alive
Come alive, come and...

I can't react how you thought I'd react, I would never for you
Front line, I won't stand in the back, 'cause you want me to
Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion, who you talkin' to?
Stand out, no, I don't wanna blend in, why you want me to?

They say be all I can be
And all want is peace peace peace peace peace peace
See the world, haven't seen it all
I wanna see, see, see, see, see, see

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream, dream, it's alive
Come alive, come on

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come on

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come on

Who you talking to?
Who you talking to?

I'm in the sky where I ought to be at, I've been watching you
Rocket ship takin' off and that, now I'm onto you
Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion, who you talkin' to?
Stand out, no, I don't wanna blend in, why you want me to?

They say be all I can be
And all want is peace peace peace peace peace peace
See the world, haven't seen it all
I wanna see, see, see, see, see, see

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream, dream, it's alive
Come alive, come on
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come on
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come on

Front line, I won't stand in the back
Front line, I won't stand in the back
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
