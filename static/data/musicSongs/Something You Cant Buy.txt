Song Name: Something You Can't Buy
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You can buy you a house
And a big shiny car
You can go without
But you won't get to far
'Cause you need someone to see you through
Someone to tell you it's alright
And you get back what you've given
And love is somethin' you can't buy

You can wear your fancy clothes
An' all those diamond rings
You can go where you go
But it won't mean a thing
'Till you find someone to see you through
Someone to tell you it's alright
And you get back what you've given
And love is somethin' you can't buy

Your world is turnin'
It's turnin' upside down
Don't look behind you
'Cause there's no one around

You get everything you see
And you wonder why
What you got you don't need
And you can't be satisfied
'Till you find someone to see you through
Someone to tell you it's alright
And you get back what you've given
And love is somethin' you can't buy

Your world is turnin'
It's turnin' upside down
Don't look behind you
'Cause there's no one around

You get everything you see
And you wonder why
What you got you don't need
And you can't be satisfied
'Till you find someone to see you through
Someone to tell you it's alright
And you get back what you've given
And love is somethin' you can't buy

'Cos you get back what you've given
And love is somethin' you can't buy

You get back what you've given
And love is somethin' you can't buy
