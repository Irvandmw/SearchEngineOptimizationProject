No expectations at all (No)
I just want what's best for you, girl
Relieve that headache, babe

He don't deserve your time
Put him on the bench a while
Let me do you better
Whoa
Don't you deserve to smile?
I'ma put in overtime
Let me do you better
Better (Hey)

Let me teach you the way you should be treated (Ha)
Let me do it the way, know you need it to be done
And we can wake up runnin' back and repeat it
Let me do you better, whoa-whoa (Yeah)
