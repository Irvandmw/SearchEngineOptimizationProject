Lyrics:


Yeah

When I look into her eyes
It ain't no suprise
Sparks start a flyin' like the 4th of July
She gets me so hot my heart starts a pumpin'
When we get to kissin' there ain't no stoppin'
When it comes to love she ain't no slacker
My little darlin' is a Firecracker

When I light the fuse I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick
Son of a gun she's fun to handle
and she packs a punch like a roman candle
She's a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a Firecracker

[Chorus]
We might not oughta take a roll in the hay
Cause we'll burn the barn down a one of these days
We're a match made in Heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We gotta go thing goin' and if feels so right
She's a Firecracker
She's the light of my life

She goes off with a great big bang
Boys I tell ya' it's a beautiful thing
When she takes off you better hang on tight
She's a blonde bottle rocket in the middle of the night
When she makes love she's a heartattacker
My little darlin' is a Firecracker

[Chorus]

uhuh

Yea, we gotta good thing going and it feels so right
She's a Firecracker
She's the light of my life

We gotta good thing goin' and it feels so right
She's a Firecracker
She's the light of my life

She's a Firecracker she's the light of my life

Firecracker
Firecracker

Ooooooo

Firecracker (sssssss)
Firecracker

Bang

Firecracker
Firecracker
