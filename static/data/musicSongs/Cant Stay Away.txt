Lyrics:


I'm headin' on track, I'm turnin' on back,
'cause honey don't know she complete my life.
'Cause I wasn't all in, I'm done with all that,
and now I gotta let him know.
Said you never lookin' back, but gimmie one try,
you say I'm still the same, but I changed my path. 
You're better than the best, forever no lie,
and I don't wanna be here lonely.

I don't wanna stay away, for another second, baby.
Lemme, lemme say everything, 
you're the only one worth fighting for.
And I won't throw my promises away, yeah. 
I don't wanna stay away, I don't want nobody, but you.

You say you don't buy, how hard I'm gonna try,
I'll never give up, gonna change your mind.
With a little romance, and maybe you'll find,
that now I'm gonna make show.
No we're never lookin' back, just leave it in the past,
I'll never be that same, 'cause you changed my path.
You know I love you best, forever no lie,
and I don't wanna be here lonely.

I don't wanna stay away, for another second baby,
Lemme, lemme say everything,
you're the only one worth fighting for.
And I won't throw my promises away, yeah.
I don't wanna stay away, I don't want nobody, but you.

And if I have to live, in a lifetime without all the ways you make me feel,
Then I'd have to lose my mind I'd be so broken into pieces over you.

See I can't stay away from you, 
I can't erase the two of us from my mind.
Whenever I try, it's like a backfire,
Blast from the past, I can see through.

Mirror, mirror on the wall,
How'd I ever let you fall?
I guess I need my baby (baby).
Woah, woah, woah, wooooah!

I don't wanna stay away, for another second baby,
Lemme, lemme say everything,
you're the only one worth fighting for.
And I won't throw my promises away, yeah.

I don't wanna stay away, for another second baby,
you're the only one worth fighting for.
And I won't throw my promises away, yeah.
I don't wanna stay away, I don't want nobody.

I don't wanna stay away, I don't want nobody but you.
