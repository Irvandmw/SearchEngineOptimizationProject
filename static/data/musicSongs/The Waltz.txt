Lyrics:


You know it's the best I've seen
I'd never tell you that it don't mean a thing
I know it's the worst you've felt
You have every right to keep it to yourself
Caught in the game of war
Traded your heart for a hand better than before

Say I let you down
Oh, you pushed me out
I let you win
I let you win

I'm dancin' alone today
I can hear a waltz, think it's calling out your name
It's saying I need you so
But please don't you say, don't you say

I let you down
Oh, you pushed me out
I let you win
I let you win
