Lyrics:


[AJ:]
I can see in your eyes
Broken windows, fallen skies
Baby, baby what you hidin' from
The light that followed you around
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run

[Brian:]
You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show 
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know 

[Howie:]
That you can let go

[AJ:]
Sifting through shattered dreams
Livin' in the in between
Baby, babe it's gonna be alright 
(You can let go)
When you're lost, let down, disappointed
And jerked around in this cold, cold world
I will always be by your side 

[Nick:]
You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show 
There ain't nothin' you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know 

[Howie:]
That you can let go

[AJ:]
Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes there's a crack in the dark

[Brian:]
Never let me see you cry
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby let me hold you tight

[Howie:]
Make it alright

[All:]
Baby, baby gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side 
When the whole world turns against you (I won't turn against you)
Not letting it show
Baby, babe gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
You can let go

[Nick/All:]
You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show 
You can let go
There ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know
