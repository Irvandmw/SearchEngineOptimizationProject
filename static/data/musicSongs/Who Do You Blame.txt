Lyrics:


Have him for word
Fuck that, you're levelin' up
Leave that nigga in the dirt
Take him back here for work
Lamborghini for my boys
All that we needed was trust
I said enough is enough
Don't got no business with you
Champagne for the exes
Pour a gram for the Lexus
Ass fat, body Texas
You star, I directed
My heart I protected
Cobain when I'm reckless
They say it switched up
Switched up, no perspective, ayy

You can't smoke tonight, you get way to live
And you can't drink tonight, you get fucked up sometimes
You and I, I lose every fight
We blur every line, risk it every time

Girl, who do you blame? Blame me
I never start a fight, I end up everytime
Girl, who do you blame? Blame me
Blame me, no, blame me
Girl, who do you blame?

I'm single, I'm faithfull
I'm young, and I'm able
Real ones on my payroll
I'm signed to my label
She's Queen and I'm Pharoah
For how I empty my barrel
Timbs' on, but her hair low
Real cute, but still ghetto

You can't smoke tonight, you get way to live
And you can't drink tonight, you get fucked up sometimes
You and I, I lose every fight
We blur every line, risk it every time

Girl, who do you blame? Blame me
I never start a fight, I end up everytime
Girl, who do you blame? Blame me
Blame me, no, blame me
Girl, who do you blame?

I don't want blame you for all of the things that you do
Don't wanna choose, but it's you, if I just had to choose
Strong independent, accpeting that you're prideful
A good woman deserves a good nigga right here besides you
