Lyrics:


Let's take an old fashioned walk
I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk

Let's take a stroll through the park
Down a lane where's it's dark
And a heart that controlled may be relaxed on an old fashioned walk

I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart
There's nothing like walking and having a heart to heart
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind
She was wrapped up and sold coming home from an old fashioned walk

I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart
There's nothing like walking and having a heart to heart
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind
She was wrapped up and sold coming home from an old fashioned walk
