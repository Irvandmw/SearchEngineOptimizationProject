Lyrics:


I can't say that you and I have been formally acquainted
But it's a [?]
I take all the blame, sincerely my responsibility
My name is eh, well eh, you'll get to know me
It's a pleasure to make me your acquainted

I came to introduce myself
If you don't like it, then fine
Otherwise if they don't mind
I'm here to introduce myself
I'll extend my arm, hopefully you'll do the same
And won't take to long when I introduce myself
When I do fall livin', well it ain't always a given
That's why I Introduce myself
My name is Carlos SAINt JHN, credit that to my mom
Know I credit that, to the fact I was born in a [?]
But they send 'em back
And because he came from far away they don't interact
But it's cool, he get the rythm, like we in the rap
There they was warmin' like we in the rack
And he just came to run around like he in a lap
But he 'on't got the right click, like he in the MAG
But I done trip you back to the fact that you don't know
Take this bit of information when you go
I came to introduce myself
If you don't like it, then fine
Otherwise if they don't mind
I'm here to introduce myself
I'll extend my arm, hopefully you'll do the same
And won't take to long when I introduce myself
When I do fall livin', well it ain't always a given
That's why I Introduce myself
My name is Carlos SAINt JHN, credit that to my mom
