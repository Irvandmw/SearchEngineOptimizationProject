Lyrics:


I thought that I could always count on you,
I thought that nothing could become between us two.
We said as long as we would stick together,
Weâd be alright,
Weâd be ok.
But I was stupid 
And you broke me down
Iâll never be the same again.

So thank you for showing me,
That best friends can not be trusted,
And thank you for lying to me,
Your friendship and good times we had you can have them back

Yeah!

I wonder why it always has to hurt,
For every lesson that you have to learn.
I wonât forget what you did to me,
How you showed me things, 
I wish Iâd never seen.
But I was stupid, 
And you broke me down,
Iâll never be the same again.

So thank you for showing me,
That best friends can not be trusted,
And thank you for lying to me,
Your friendship the good times we had you can have them back

When the tables turn again,
Youâll remember me my friend,
Youâll be wishing I was there for you.
Iâll be the one youâll miss the most,
But youâll only find my ghost.
As time goes by,
Youâll wonder why, 
Youâre all alone.

So thank you for showing me,
That best friends can not be trusted,
And thank you for lying to me,
Your friendship and good times we had you can have them back.

So thank you, for lying to me,
So thank you, for all the times you let me down
So thank you, for lying to me,
So thank you, your friendship you can have it back
