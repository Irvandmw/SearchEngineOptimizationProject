Lyrics:


I got a date with destiny
My heart says yeah but can't convince the rest of me
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me
I need redemption no need to mention my past
Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash
The glits the glamour the lights the camera the action
The stage the fans the speakers blastin'
You know I'm wanted I need it don't doubt it I can't live without it
It's just everything I dreamed of
It's everything I've ever wanted
But is it really truly in my plans
Or did God mix up my blue prints
Did he have it right there in his hands?
Anybody give me a hint
I can feel it now I know it's coming
And I don't give a fuck what anybody say
I've fallen I've risen I chose to select to dismiss an incarnation through these bars created-a prison
And I intend to do the time and the sentence that's given
25 to life yeah that's how I'm living
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever make it
But there's only way I'm a know
I'm like a seed planted in the dirt
Feels like I've been waiting forever to grow
And maybe today is the day
And maybe tonight is the night
But one thing that I know for sure
This time I'm a get it right
