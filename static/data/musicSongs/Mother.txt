Lyrics:


Driving down the concrete beams
Looking around and it now seems
Mama Earth is nowhere
Gone from your eyes
Hidden in the crust
Of man's scientific dreams
She is gone
Natural man took her natural face
Made it a strange and alien place
You can't bear to look
'Cause she ain't there
Our Mother has been raped
And left to die in disgrace
She is gone
