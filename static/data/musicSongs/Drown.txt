Lyrics:


Good morning day
Sorry Iâm not there
But all my favourite friends
Vanished in the air
Itâs hard to fly when you canât even run
Once I had the world, but now Iâve got no one

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I drownâ¦.drown

Good morning day
Sorry youâre not here
All those times before
Weâre never this unclear
Itâs hard to walk when you canât even crawl
Once I had this world, but now Iâve lost it all

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I drown

Rolling faster than Iâm breathing
Drown
Rolling faster than Iâm breathing
Drown
Rolling faster than Iâm breathing

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
(Save myself before I drown, save myself before I drown, save myself before I drown)
