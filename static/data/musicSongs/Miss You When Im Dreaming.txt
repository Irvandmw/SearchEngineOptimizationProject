Lyrics:


Today I didn't think of you,today was alright
I had a lot of things to do
I was moving on with my life

But now I need some answers, some answers
I'm tired and I'm getting weak
Some answers, some answers

I only miss you when I'm dreaming
That's why I don't wanna close my eyes
Tell me why you only hurt me when I'm sleeping
The only time I can't put up a fight
Is when I'm dreaming

Another hour passes by
It's gonna be a long night ahead
Cause I feel you creeping up inside my mind
Every time I look at my bed

But now I need some answers, some answers
I'm tired and I'm weak
Some answers, some answers

I only miss you when I'm dreaming
That's why I don't wanna close my eyes
Tell me why you only hurt me when I'm sleeping
The only time I can't put up a fight 

The only time I can't live without you 
Dreaming; I can't let you go

I only miss you when I'm dreaming
That's why I don't wanna close my eyes
Tell me why you only hurt me when I'm sleeping
The only time I can't control my mind, oh
And the only time I can't put up a fight
I miss you when I'm dreaming
