Lyrics:


I know your mother loves you, your father loves you too
But their kind of love is no kind of love
Next to my love for you

Well I'm sure you find their kisses most satisfactory
But you're gonna hiss the very next kiss after one kiss from me
Well your French poodle is off his noodle never goes out to play
He guards you night and day, that job is mine I say

I know the cop, the mailman, yes, and the milkman too
Agree that you're rare and I more than share their view
So tell your father and your mother and your sister and your brother and the poodle too
That they'll never ever love you like I do

Well your French poodle is off his noodle never goes out to play 
He guards you night and day, that job is mine I say
I know the cop, the mailman, yes, and the milkman too
Agree that you're rare and I more than share their view
So tell your father and your mother and your sister and your brother and the poodle too
That they'll never ever love you like I do
