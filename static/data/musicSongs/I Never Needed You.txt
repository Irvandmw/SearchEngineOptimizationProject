Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Here I am again staring at these unfamiliar walls
Of some hotel so far from home
I try my best to sleep, I close my eyes
But all this peace and quiet just reminds me I'm alone
Let me hear your voice on the wind
Let me feel your touch on my skin

[Chorus]
I never wanted you the way I want you now
I would give anything to see your arms reach out
I never hurt like this or felt the emptiness I feel inside
I never needed you like I need you tonight

All I think about is how sweet you look standing in the doorway
Smiling while I brushed away your tears
All I dream about is the next time I can hold you
And I can show you all the love I'm feeling here
All I know is I can't wait, my body trembles, my heart aches

[Repeat Chorus]
