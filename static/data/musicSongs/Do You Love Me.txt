Lyrics:


[Ariana:]
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Oh, do you love me?
Now that I can dance
Watch me now
Drop

[Sky Blu:]
I can mash potato
I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Do you like it like this?
Ariana and your boy Sky Blu
I gotta tell you something baby
I think I love you

Born to party
Born to rock
Big bad, baby, we're on top
Rolling in the cadi
Hilowitz making hits like granddaddy
Busta move, get in the groove
Baby girl I'm into you
Show me what you can do
I got you, boom
You're feeling some new

[Ariana Grande:]
Tell me if it's meant to be
I'll give my love but it ain't for free
So watch it now, talk's cheap
Baby cash then come with me
Say dance dance young romance
You bad boy better take a chance
I'm the best baby that's on the hand
So, oh, oh,
Need your love
Do you love me?
Oh, do you love me boy?
Oh, do you love me baby?
Now that I can da-a-ance
Watch me now
Drop

Cause I can mash potato
And I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Do you like it like this?
Ariana, and my boy Sky Blu
I gotta tell ya baby
I think I love you

[Sky Blu:]
Got the money, got the cash
On the dance floor I'm Michael Jackson
Time for some action, here we go
Sky blu on the stereo
Turn it up, hurry up
She doing it Grande, that's what's up
Her plus me you can add it up
You'll never get enough

[Ariana:]
Tell me if it's meant to be
I'll give my love but it ain't for free
So watch it now, talk is cheap
Baby cash then come with me
Say dance dance young romance
You bad boy better take a chance
I'm the best baby that's on the hand
So, oh, oh,
Baby boy I need to know
Do you love me?
Oh, do you love me?
Oh, do you love me boy?
Now that I can da-a-ance
Watch me now

[Sky Blue:]
You broke my heart
Cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
But now I'm back
To let you know
I can really shuffle them down yeah!

Do you lo-ove me
(HEY HEY)

Do you love me?
(YEAH)

Oh, do you lo-o-ove me?
(Sky Blu baby)

Do you lo-o-ove me?
(Ariana Grande)

Tell me (lo-ove me)

Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
