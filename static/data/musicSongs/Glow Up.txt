Lyrics:


Woo
Ah
Hey
Uh

Take your time
Be patient on yourself
'Cause you, lose your mind
Trying to be someone else

So don't you dare
Stare at all them comments
Baby watch and wait
They gonna see what's coming, coming
It's coming
It's coming when you least expect it

You'll glow up
Don't worry about it
Baby you'll glow up (I said)
Don't worry about it
You'll glow up, when you'll glow up (I said)
Don't worry 'cause you're cute right now
When you least expect it, you'll glow up

You are loved
No matter how you look
It's the way you are
Got everybody shook

So don't you dare
Stare at all them comments
Baby watch and wait
They gonna see what's coming, coming
And it's coming
It's coming when you least expect it

You'll glow up (Hey)
Don't worry about it (C'mon)
Baby you'll glow up (I said)
Don't worry about it
You'll glow up, you'll grow up (I said)
Don't worry cause you're cute right now
When you least expect it, you'll glow up

Don't worry about it babe (Hey, hey)
You'll glow on me
When you'll learn
When you'll learn to love, love yourself babe
You'll see a change
So don't you dare
So don't you dare (no no)
Stare at all them comments
Baby watch and wait
They gonna see what's coming, coming
And it's coming
It's coming when you least expect it

You'll glow up (Woo)
Don't worry about it (C'mon, say)
Baby you'll glow up (I said)
Don't worry about it
You'll glow up, you'll grow up (I said)
Don't worry 'cause you're cute right now babe
When you least expect it, you'll glow up (you'll glow up)
Don't worry about it
Baby you'll glow up (I said)
Don't worry about it
You'll glow up, you'll grow up (I said)
Don't worry 'cause you're cute right now
When you least expect it, you'll glow up

Don't worry about it, (don't worry about it babe nah nah)
You'll glow on me
One day when you'll love
When you'll learn to love, love yourself
You'll see a change
Oh don't worry about it babe
You'll glow on me
When you'll learn to love, love yourself
You'll see a change
