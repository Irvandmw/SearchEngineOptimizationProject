Lyrics:


(So young!... 
So young!... So young!...) 

You make me feel so young, 
You make me feel so Spring has sprung! 
And every time I see you grin, 
I'm such a happy, individual! 

The moment that you speak, 
I wanna go play hide an' seek! 
I wanna go an' bounce the moon, 
Just like a toy balloon! 

You and I... 
Are just like a couple of tots! 
Runnin' across the meadow... 
An' pickin' up lots of forget-me-nots! 

You make me feel so young, 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung... 
Bells to be rung, 
An' a wonderful fling to be flung! 

And even when I'm old an' grey... 
(And even when I'm old an' grey...) 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today! 
('Cause you...) 
You make me feel so young! 

[instrumental verse]

And even when I'm old an' grey... 
(And even when I'm old an' grey...) 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today! 
('Cause you...) 
You make me feel so young! 

You make me feel so young! 
(So Young!)
