Lyrics:


Clumsy
But I love how you go down
Head first and style it out
Again and again
Clumsy
Keep on bumping into you
Bangin' all over this bedroom
Again and again

Call me a fool, call me insane
But don't call it a day
Closer to you, closer to pain
It's better than far away
Whoaaa

Hey, clumsy
Hey, clumsy

Clumsy
'Cuz I be slipping out this dress
Fooling around and then we smash
Again and again (come here, baby)
Clumsy
Never told a soul about what we've done
You let it roll right off your tongue
Again and again

Call me a fool, call me insane
But don't call it a day
Closer to you, closer to pain
It's better than far away
Whoaaa

Hey, clumsy
Hey, clumsy

Clumsy
Bangin' all over this bedroom
C-clumsy, c-clumsy
Bangin' all over this bedroom
C-clumsy, c-clumsy
Bangin' all over this bedroom
Bangin' all over this bedroom
Again and again and again and again and again and again and-

Call me a fool, call me insane
But donât call it a day
Closer to you, closer to pain
It's better than far away
Whoaaa

Hey, clumsy
Hey, clumsy
