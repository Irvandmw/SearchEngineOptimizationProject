[Lil Dicky:]
What up, world? It's your boy, just one of the guys down here. Well, I could be more specific. Uh, I'm a human, and I just wanted to, you know, for the sake of all of us earthlings out there, just wanted to say:

[Chorus:]
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home

[Justin Bieber:]
Hi, I'm a baboon
I'm like a man, just less advanced and my anus is huge

[Ariana Grande:]
Hey, I'm a zebra
No one knows what I do, but I look pretty cool
Am I white or black?

[Halsey:]
I'm a lion cub, and I'm always getting licked (Meow!)

[Zac Brown:]
How's it going? I'm a cow (Moo!)
You drink milk from my tits (Moo)

[Brendon Urie:]
I'm a fat, fucking pig

[Hailee Steinfeld:]
I'm a common fungus

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I'm a disgruntled skunk, shoot you out my butthole

[Snoop Dogg:]
I'm a marijuana plant, I can get you fucked up

[Kevin Hart:]
And I'm Kanye West

[Chorus:]
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth

[Adam Levine:]
Ba-dum-da-dum-dum, ba-dum-da-di
We are the vultures, feed on the dead

[Shawn Mendes:]
We're just some rhinos, horny as heck

[Charlie Puth:]
I'm just a giraffe, what's with this neck?

[Sia:]
Hippity-hop, I'm a kangaroo
I hop all day, up and down with you

[Miley Cyrus:]
I'm an elephant, I got junk in my trunk

[Lil Jon:]
What the fuck? I'm a clam!

[Rita Ora:]
I'm a wolf. Howl!

[Miguel:]
I'm a squirrel, lookin' for my next nut

[Katy Perry:]
And I'm a pony, just a freak horse, heh-heh-heh
But, uh, c'mon, get on (Yah)
Giddee-up, let's ride

[Lil Yachty:]
I'm HPV, don't let me in

[Ed Sheeran:]
I'm a koala and I sleep all the time
So what? It's cute

[Meghan Trainor:]
We love you, India

[Joel Embiid:]
We love you, Africa

[Tory Lanez:]
We love the Chinese

[Lil Dicky:]
We forgive you, Germany

[Chorus:]
Earth, it is our planet (It's our planet)
We love the Earth (We love the Earth), it is our home (Home)
We love the Earth, it is our planet (It is our planet)
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth

[Lil Dicky:]
I'm a man (Hello?)
Can you hear me? (Anyone out there? Hello?)
I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit (What's going on?)
I hope it's not a simulation (Huh)
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick (Woo), eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill (Hey), respect what we built (Hey)
Like look at the Internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love to cum when you have sex? (Ayy)
And I heard women orgasms are better than a dick's (Uh)
So what we got this land for? What we gotta stand for?
Love, and we love the Earth (The Earth)

[Ariana Grande:]
Oh, yeah, baby, I love the Earth
I love this planet

[Lil Dicky:]
Hey, Russia, we're cool
Hey, Asia, all of you, c'mon
Every one of you from the plains to the Sahara
Let's come together and live

[Choir:]
Hum-dum-dum-dae-dum, hum-dum-dum-dae-dum

[PSY:]
ì°-ì°-ì°ë¦¬ë ì§êµ¬ë¥¼ ì¬ëí´ì

[Bad Bunny:]
Amamos la tierra

[Kris Wu:]
æä»¬ç±å°ç

[Lil Dicky:]
(We love you, we love you)
C'mon everybody, I know we're not all the same
But we're living on the same Earth
(We love you, we love you)

[Ariana Grande:]
Have you ever been to Earth?

[Lil Dicky:]
Everyone who's listening has been to Earth, Ariana
(We love you, we love you)
We're not making music for aliens here

[Justin Bieber:]
Are we gonna die?

[Lil Dicky:]
You know what, Bieber? We might die
(We love you, we love you)
I'm not gonna lie to you
I mean, there's so many people out there who don't think global warming's a real thing. You know? We gotta save this planet. We're being stupid

[Ariana Grande:]
Unless we get our shit together now

[Music Video version:]

[Lil Dicky:]
Guys, everybody look into whatever the fuck Leonardo DiCaprio is always pushing, 'cause I feel like that guy knows more about... the Earth and how we're fuckin' it up than... anybody!
If the aliens did come, we should definitely send Leo as our guy, our rep
In fact, the profits that come along with the streams and the sale of this song are going right into the Earth
Let's raise some money for charity
Any words, Leo?

[Leonardo DiCaprio:]
This might be my favorite song ever
It's awesome

[Lil Dicky:]
Wow
Thanks, Leo

[Backstreet Boys:]
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Woo, hoo, hoo!)

[Lil Dicky:]
(Guys, thank you so much)
