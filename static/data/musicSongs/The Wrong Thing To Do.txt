Lyrics:


I'm walkin' away, and leavin' you standin'
I've nothing to say, for I've said it all the best way I know how
Cry, cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
'Cause that's the wrong thing to do.
Does it ease you to know, that I've thought about stayin'
Yet I think I will go, and let the words of goodbye go unsaid
Speak, speak if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
'Cause that's the wrong thing to do.

All the words that you whisper are words that have nothing to say
And the thoughts they reveal are the reasons I'm goin' away
From the touch of your voice, I can feel separation
So you leave me no choice, for to remain would mean living apart
Touch, touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
'Cause that's the wrong thing to do.
That's the wrong thing to do.
That's the wrong thing to do.
