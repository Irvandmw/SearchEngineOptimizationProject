Lyrics:


[Nicky:]
There's two things I
know for sure
She was sent here from heaven
And she's daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees
by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I
close my eyes
And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
Oh but most of all..

[Shane:]
Butterfly kisses after
bed time prayer
Sticking little white
flowers all up in her hair
Walk beside the pony daddy, it's my first ride
I know the cake looks funny daddy
But I sure tried
Oh with all that I've
done wrong I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning
And butterfly kisses at night

[Mark:]
Sweet sixteen today
She's looking like her
mother a little more everyday
One part woman, the other part girl
To perfume and make up
From ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in
a great big world
But I remember..

[Shane:]
Butterfly kisses after
bed time prayer
Sticking little white
flowers all up in her hair
You know how much I love you daddy
But if you don't mind
I'm only gonna kiss you
on the cheek this time
Oh with all that I've
done wrong I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning
And butterfly kisses at night

[Kian:]
She'll change her name today
She'll make a promise
and I'll give her away
Standing in the bedroom just staring at her
She asked me what I'm thinking
And I said I'm not sure
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl
She leaned over gave me

[Shane:]
Butterfly kisses with her mother there
Sticking little white
flowers all up in her hair
Walk me down the aisle daddy, it's just about time
Does my wedding dress look pretty daddy?
Daddy don't cry
Oh with all that I've done wrong
I must have done
something right
To deserve a hug every morning
And butterfly kisses a hug in every morning
And butterfly kisses at night
