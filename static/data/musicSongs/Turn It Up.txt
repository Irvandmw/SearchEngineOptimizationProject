Lyrics:


Turn it up, turn it up, baby
My signal's gettin' kinda weak
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
I know you got to be a freak, ooh
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
I'm still waiting by the knob
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
I'm ready for the heavy stuff, oh yeah

Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Come and play with my controls
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Work me like a radio (oh, oh)

Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Work it 'til I start to groove, ooh
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
I know you know what to do
(Girl, you know what to do)
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Work it 'til my clothes are wet
Turn it up, turn it up
I wanna drown in your body's sweat!
(Oh yeah)

Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Come and play with my controls
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Work me like a radio (oh, oh)
Now turn it up!

Come here
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Give me everything you got
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
You know I know you got a lot (Oh yeah)
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
I'll play what you want me to play
Turn it up, turn it up
It ain't no good unless you turn it up all the way - yeah, yeah!

Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Come and play with my controls (oh, oh)
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Work me like a radio (Come on, baby, turn it up)
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Come and play with my controls (oh)
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Work me like a radio
(Listen to me now)

Come on baby, what's it gonna be?
Are you gonna do it or are you gonna leave it up to me?
Are you gonna stop? Are you gonna drop?
Kiss me, kiss me! Yeah!

Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Come and play with my controls (oh)
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Work me like a radio (Come on, gotta, gotta, gotta...) (Oh yeah)
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Come and play with my controls (oh)
Turn it up, turn it up, baby
Work me like a - work me like a ...
Now turn it up!

Yeah, yeah
That wasn't it, now turn it down
Oh, ditty whop
Oh, ditty whop
Oh, ditty whop
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, ditty whop
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, ditty whop
Oh, ditty whop
Yeah, yeah
Oh, ditty whop
Oh, ditty whop
Yeah, yeah
Listen to me
Come and play with my controls
Work me like a radio
Come and play with my controls
Shock-a
Work me like a radio
