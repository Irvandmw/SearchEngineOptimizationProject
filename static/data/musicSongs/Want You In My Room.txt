Lyrics:


When all the lights out, hey, where you goin'?
I'd keep a window for ya if I was open
I'm like a lighthouse, I'm a reminder of where you're goin'
I'm in your head now and every second now, is your love going?

Oh, with you, I'm gonna get bolder
(I just wanna get a little bit closer)
Hey, and I press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no, the night's not over
(I just wanna get a little bit closer) Little bit closer
And I press you to the pages of my heart

(I want you in my room)
On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby don't you want me too?

When no one loves you like they really mean it
I got you covered, under covers
Can you feel it?

Oh, with you, I got to get bolder
(I just wanna get a little bit closer)
Hey, and I press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no, the night's not over
(I just wanna get a little bit closer) Little bit closer
And I press you to the pages of my heart
Hey

(I want you in my room)
On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby don't you want me too?
