Lyrics:


Take me back to the time,
We would talk all night
Those healing words I've never heard
Put my world to right
She told me you don't see what I can see,
This life is full of possibility
She gave me more than gold, gave me all I need
Without her I'm a poor man

I'd be the king of the world
If you were by my side
'Cause when you gave me your love
I was the richest man alive
Now I'm broken, hopin' you'll come back in my life
I'd be the king of the world
If you were here tonight!

Remember when way back then we'd lie there in the dark
My best friend, we said we'd never end
As we looked up to the stars
She showed me how to be all that I could be
Broke into my heart and set me free
She gave me a reason to believe,
Without her I'm a poor man!

I'd be the king of the world
If you were by my side
'Cause when you gave me your love
I was the richest man alive
Now I'm broken, hopin' you'll come back in my life
I'd be the king of the world
If you were here tonight!

Oooooh oh
Oooooh oh
Come back in my life
Oooooh oh
Oooooh oh
I need you here tonight,
Without her I'm a poor man!

I'd be the king of the world
If you were by my side
'Cause when you gave me your love
I was the richest man alive
Now I'm broken, hopin' you'll come back in my life
I'd be the king of the world
If you were here tonight!
I'd be the king of the world
If you were by my side
