Lyrics:


From the beginning it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers

Keep running over
Me with your loving
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep running over
Me with your loving
Looking like it's turning into something

Wednesday
It felt like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said "Hello", I lost my sanity
Thought you was looking through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over

Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

Keep running over
Me with your loving
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep running over
Me with your loving
Looking like it's turning into something
Better that than turning into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)
Ain't no interrupting this eruption (Way-oh, way-oh)

(LD!)
I believe in love
Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your I.G. and was scrolling down for hours
I got back to 2015 and you started looking young, so I stopped (Oh)
Post intercourse when you walk by (Ass, ass, ass)
More buns than a Shop Rite (Whoa)
And you wanna sleep over my crib? Lemme go and get you a soft t-shirt, here (Soft-t)
What are our kids gonna be like?
What is your skin routine like?
Girl, just run around bed with me
I'll flirt with you all cleverly
I'll lock you down, Pat Beverley
I'll kiss your breast so tenderly, wussup? (Breast)
How are you so hot and cute? (How?)
I wanna make a language up with you
You're already driving me crazy, so just

Keep running over
Me with your loving
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep running over
Me with your loving
Looking like it's turning into something
Better that than turning into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)
Ain't no interrupting this eruption (Way-oh, way-oh)
