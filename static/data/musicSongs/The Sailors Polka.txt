Lyrics:


Come on and play the sailors' polka
Make way for Navy blue
Oh how the girls love to polka
With a sailor who's tried and true

Where there is music and there's moonlight
The Navy knows what to do
So come on and play the sailors' polka
Make way for Navy blue

(Oh the band will start a-playing
When the fleet comes sailing in
They'll be hip hip hip hooray-ing
And the good times will begin)

They'll be gobs and gobs of misses
Who'll be waiting on the shore
With gobs and gobs of kisses
For the gobs that they adore

(Long before they drop anchor
You will hear the music start
Every pretty girl will hanker
To win a sailor's heart)

Yeah, the band will start a-playing
The dancing will begin
When the fleet comes sailing in

Come on and play the sailors' polka
Make way for Navy blue
Oh how the girls love to polka
With a sailor who's tried and true

Where there is music and there's moonlight
The Navy knows what to do
So come on and play the sailors' polka
Make way for Navy blue
