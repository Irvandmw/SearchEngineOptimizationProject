Song Name: I'm Gonna Come Back
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Building it up tearing it down
The circle goes round and around
Lessons are learned and bridges burned
I'm hoping the tide will turn

I'm gonna change direction
Just for my own protection

A flag is up I see the sign
It's just a matter of time
The wind will blow and the trees will bend
Nothing is left in the end

It isn't my desire
To set the world on fire

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna come back when the war is over
When you're ready to make amends
Fill up the cracks and find the pieces
Then put them all back again

I see you there in the air
Nothing to break your fall
The damage is done you've had your fun
Who is gonna pay for it all

It isn't my desire
To set the world on fire

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna come back when the war is over
When you're ready to make amends
Fill up the cracks and find the pieces
Then put them all back again
I'm turning my back as the walls are falling
Staying away till the dust is gone
I'm under attack and a voice is calling
Better stay away something's wrong
