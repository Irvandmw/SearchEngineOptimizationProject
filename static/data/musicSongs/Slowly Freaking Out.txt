Lyrics:


Every day is one more inch of a slow blade sinking in.
Vision fading, suffocating inside my own skin.

And Iâm fighting a stranger in my eyes
And I know that only one of us will survive
If I canât save us I've got to save myself.

I canât stay here in this place,
I'm slowly freaking out, Iâm slowly freaking out.
I canât breathe
Youâre addicting.
Iâm slowly freaking out, Iâm slowly freaking out
And out and out again.

Enigmatic, stuck like static
This feeling I canât shake.
But just remember that I warned you
My will can never break.

And Iâm fighting a stranger in my eyes
And I know that only one of us will survive
If I canât save us I've got to save myself.

I canât stay here in this place,
I'm slowly freaking out, Iâm slowly freaking out.
I canât breathe
Youâre addicting.
Iâm slowly freaking out, Iâm slowly freaking out
And out and out again.

I canât stay here in this place,
I'm slowly freaking out, Iâm slowly freaking out.
I canât stay in this place,
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe, you're addicting.
Iâm slowly freaking out, Iâm slowly freaking out
And out and out again.
