Lyrics:


Every time, every time you tell me you gon' change
You're never right, it's probably best we go our separate ways
If you look in my eyes, you gotta know it's true
Told me a million lies but I still try to make due
Baby, I gave you time and always more
Baby, you got what you want and now I'm paying for it

Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official
Talking all that shit, it don't mean
Fuck around and go missing, oh
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes
Stranger in my eyes
You're a stranger in my

I'mma be okay, my path is gonna get clearer
Live in the moment, keeping you in my back mirror
What you gonna do when nobody's at home? Yeah
Shoulda thought of that when you turned so cold babe

Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official
Talking all that shit, it don't mean
Fuck around and go missing, oh
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes
Stranger in my eyes
You're a stranger in my

We were meant to fall, fall right out of love
And I can't even say that you were there for me girl
We were meant to fall, fall right out of love
And I can't even say that you were there for me, yeah yeah girl you

Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official
Talking all that shit, it don't mean
Fuck around and go missing, oh
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes
Stranger in my eyes
You're a stranger in my
