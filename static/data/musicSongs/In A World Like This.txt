Lyrics:


[Verse 1:]
[AJ:]
You've got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm yours
You found me heartbroken, heartbroken
On the floor
[Brian:]
Became my salvation, salvation
Through the mourn, yeah
You got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm sure

[Chorus:]
In a world like this where some back down
I, I, know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I, I, know we're gonna take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this,
[AJ:] I've got you

[Verse 2:]
[Nick:]
And now I'm free falling, free falling
In your eyes
You got me still calling, still calling
No surprise
[Kevin:]
I never knew I could love 'til the
End of time, yeah
And now I'm free falling, free falling
By your side

[Chorus:]
In a world like this where some back down
I, I, know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I, I, know we're gonna take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this,
[Brian:] I've got you
[All:] Ah,
[Aj:] Yeah
[Brian:] Ah, In a world like this

[Middle:]
[Howie:]
You got me wide open, wide open, yeah
And now I'm free falling, free falling
[AJ:] Hey, yeah, yeah
[Brian:]
Yeah yeah yeah
In a world like, in a world like
[Nick:] 'Cause I got you
[Brian:] In a world like this

[Chorus: emphasis on Brian]
In a world like this where some back down
I, I, know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I, I, know we're gonna take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this,
[AJ:] I've got you
