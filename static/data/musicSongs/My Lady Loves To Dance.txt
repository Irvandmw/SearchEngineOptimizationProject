Lyrics:


My lady loves to dance, my lady loves to sing
My lady has the sparkle of a diamond ring
When purple shadows fall and silver moonlight beams
My lady love to dance in my dreams

She loves a carousel, a roller coaster ride
A party or a picnic by the ocean side
And like a laughing brook the dancers in the sun
My lady has a barrel of fun

Life is a gay thing, play thing, hit parade thing
Not a worry not a care
If there's a trombone toottin' a flute a-fluttin'
Sure as shootin' we'll be there

My lady loves to dance, my lady loves to sing
A schottische or a polka or a gaylin' fling
And when we kiss goodnight the moment we're apart
My lady loves to dance, my lady loves to sing
Sing and dance in my heart

Life is a gay thing, a play thing, a hit parade
Not a worry or a care
If there's a trombone tootin' a flute a-flutin'
Sure as shootin' we'll be there

My lady loves to dance, my lady loves to sing
A schottische or a polka or a gaylin' fling
And when we kiss goodnight the moment we're apart
My lady loves to dance, my lady loves to sing
Sing and dance in my heart
She loves to sing and dance in my heart
