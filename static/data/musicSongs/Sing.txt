Lyrics:


La, la la la la... 

Sing, sing a song, 
Sing out loud, sing out strong, 
Sing of the good things, not bad, 
Sing of the happy, not sad... 

Sing, sing a song, 
Make it simple, to last your whole life long, 
Don't worry that it's not good enough, 
For anyone else to hear, 
Sing, sing a song... 

La, la la la la... 
Sing (sing..) sing a song (sing..) 
Sing out loud, sing out strong, 
Sing of  good things, not bad, 
Sing of  happy, not sad... 

Sing, sing a song, 
Make it simple, to last your whole life long, 
Don't worry that it's not good enough, 
For anyone else to hear, 
Sing, sing a song... 

Sing, sing a song... 
Sing, sing a song... 

La, la la la la...
