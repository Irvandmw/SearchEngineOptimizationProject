Lyrics:


This ain't a diss song, this a real song
Nigga, we ain't runnin' from no responsibilities
I take care of families
I'm embarrassed over this mess that I done caused

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid
And it's way too many homicides
Bought a hunnid guns, got my niggas sliding
Fucked the bitch once, now she wanna cry
Snitches told the Feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughing to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

Gotta keep it stashed up for the trial
Material intentions got her playing foul
I'm in rare form like a hyena runnin' wild
All the opps getting gunned down

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid
And it's way too many homicides
Bought a hunnid guns, got my niggas sliding
Fucked the bitch once, now she wanna cry
Snitches told the Feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughing to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

I lost connections to the streets and I was in denial
I seen a grown man shed tears 'cause he lost his trial
I said, the streets a crazy feeling just to lose a child
Have a one-on-one with God, yeah, it been a while
I woke up paranoid off drugs
I said, "I'm tired now"
I answer my phone in the middle of the night
Like, "Who done died now?"
Knowing I'm involved
But we gon' slide back when it's dying down
I don't know who opps no more
You look crazy, I'm firing rounds

I love the streets, it's a portion of me
I came from nothing to "The Voice of the Streets"
I got blood in the streets
The way he died, I advised he died in his sleep
That's the trenches

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid
And it's way too many homicides
Bought a hunnid guns, got my niggas sliding
Fucked the bitch once, now she wanna cry
Snitches told the Feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughing to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

Public conversation got you touching clouds
Pop the wrong pill, hit the wrong dial
Ain't no visitation waiting for the trial
Took my last name, this ain't 'bout the child
Real classy jazzy, but don't do no trolling
Gotta treat you like dead when you playing bogus

See, Pluto you my brother gotta stay focused
Sometimes I get in my feelings too
I wish I wore a Trojan
They tryna go viral off DMs that's why I'm antisocial
I'm just tryna teach the killers not to use emotion
I got a whole bitch, don't think about my old bitch
I'm just tryna live my life and catch this moment

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid
And it's way too many homicides
Bought a hunnid guns, got my niggas sliding
Fucked the bitch once, now she wanna cry
Snitches told the Feds, I had an alibi
Broken hearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughing to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile
