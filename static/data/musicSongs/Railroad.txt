Lyrics:


I'm packin' my bags and goin' home
I been here too long
So happy, I'll get there on my own
Been here for reasons right or wrong
So I'm packin' my bag and I'm gettin' home

So I'll walk by the railroad anytime, anytime
Walk by the railroad anytime
Tell my brother and my sister
That everything's gone wrong
So I'm walkin' by that railroad till I'm home

There's been lies told in my story
But I ain't juiced none of that glory
But still, I served my time
And there's no use in cryin'
'Cause I'm walkin' by that railroad till I'm home

So I'll walk by the railroad anytime, anytime
Walk by the railroad anytime
Tell my women that I missed her
That I can't wait to kiss her
'Cause I'm walkin' by that railroad till I'm home

Yes, I'll walk by the railroad anytime, anytime
Walk by the railroad anytime
Tell my women that I missed her
That I can't wait to kiss her
'Cause I'm walkin' by that railroad till I'm home
Yes, I'm walkin' by that railroad till I'm home.
