Lyrics:


If you love me, like you say you do, baby be true to me
If you love me, like you say you do, baby never stray from me
I want you darlin' ever by my side, baby now can't you see?

Oh baby I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
Oh baby I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
Say you'll forgive me, I know I've done you mighty wrong

Oh baby I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
Oh baby I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
Say you'll forgive me, I know I've done you mighty wrong

If you want me ever by your side, ya gotta be true to me
If you want me ever by your side, ya gotta stay home with me
Don't want no other man lovin' you, baby oh can't you see?

Oh baby I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
Oh baby I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
Say you'll forgive me, I know I've done you mighty wrong

Oh baby I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
Oh baby I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
Say you'll forgive me, I know I've done you mighty wrong
