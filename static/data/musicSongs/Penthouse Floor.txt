[John Legend:]
All this trouble in this here town
All this shit going down
When will they focus, on this
Streets ride up with the TV crews
Look ma, we on the news
But they didn't notice
Before this
They float above the city lights
Forget the truth inhale the lies
Just enjoy the show
They see us reaching for the sky
Just ignore them to survive

Maybe we should go
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Penthouse floor

All that bubbly all that wine
Oh man look at the times
Didn't they notice, notice
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this

Once you're above the city lights
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own
The holding on is made for us
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home

Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
Can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)

[Chance The Rapper:]
I heard this old joke once, it was like uh knock knock, who's there, it's us, who's us?
Just us, who dis? Just playin'
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era
I'm in the penthouse baby
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs
Held back, I had to grab crab legs
And then there were only but a few
Conversations held with patience, what a party what a view
What a dress, what a song
What a beautiful time
My folks still downstairs waiting in line
They never been in these rooms
They never stayed with these folks
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes
So was I fly in my suit, in a group, on the cover
Forcing a smile, then he tells me another
He said what happened to the boy that climbed in the trunk
He pushed me off the top he said "Jump nigga jump!"

[John Legend:]
Oh don't bring me down I need a room in the clouds
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate
Oh my favourite mix
A little ignorance and bliss
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse

Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
We'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Those penthouse doors
We'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Baby, I'm in the penthouse floor
Baby, let's ride the elevator
Til we can rise some more
Go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go let's go let's go)
