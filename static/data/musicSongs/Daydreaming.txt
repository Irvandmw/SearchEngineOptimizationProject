Lyrics:


You walked in,
Caught my attention,
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension.

It's the way you walk,
The way you talk,
The way you make me feel inside.
It's in your smile,
It's in your eyes,
I don't wanna wait for tonight.

So, I'm daydreaming
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you,
You and only you.
Got me daydreaming
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you,
You and only you.

For you,
For you,
For you,
For you.

Now I can't wait
To hold you in my arms.
I know I was made for you.
I'm in love with all of your charm.

It's the way you walk,
The way you talk,
The way you make me feel inside.
It's in your smile,
It's in your eyes,
I don't wanna wait for tonight.

So, I'm daydreaming
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you,
You and only you.
Got me daydreaming
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you,
You and only you.

Well, I want you.
Got to have it.
And I need you
Like I never had loving before.

Oh, I want you.
Ooh I need you.
Got to have it
Like I never had loving before.

So, I'm daydreaming
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you,
You and only you.
Got me daydreaming
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you,
You and only you.

For you,
For you,
For you,
For you,
For you.
