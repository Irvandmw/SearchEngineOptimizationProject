Lyrics:


They say that the hardest thing to do is say goodbye
They say it's the hardest thing
We tried to stitch it up and now I wonder why
Why is this happening to me?

But it wasn't right, had another fight
We were young but we never quite took flight
In another life maybe you and I
Would be walking down the aisle dressed in white

I can see that all you need is everything I'll never be
But everyone changes, everyone changes
Say goodbye and let it be, I thought you were the one for me
But everyone changes, everyone changes

You say you left everything behind all because of me
But I gave you everything
Dreaming of futures with a child and a family
Did they ever mean a thing to you?

But it wasn't right, had another fight
We were young but we never quite took flight
In another life maybe you and I
Would be walking down the aisle dressed in white

I can see that all you need is everything I'll never be
But everyone changes, everyone changes
Say goodbye and let it be, I thought you were the one for me
But everyone changes, everyone changes

But it wasn't right, had another fight
We were young but we never quite took flight
In another life maybe you and I
Would be walking down the aisle dressed in white

I can see that all you need is everything I'll never be
But everyone changes, everyone changes
Say goodbye and let it be, I thought you were the one for me
But everyone changes, everyone changes
