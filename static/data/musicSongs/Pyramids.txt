Lyrics:


Hahaha

I can't make you love me
Oh, baby, my queen
Your love is royalty (Oh)
I can't make you fall for me
Ooh, baby, my queen
Your love is royalty
Oh, no

And I will set your tempo, baby
If it's okay, if it's okay
And I wanna go and spend away, wherever you are, baby
Wherever you might be
I'm here as your servant
Ooh, my majesty
I'm doin' whatever you ask of me

This don't need explainin' (No)
This thing here, God made it (Ooh)
Like the pyramids, like the pyramids (No)
This don't need explainin'
This thing here, God made it (Oh)
'Cause only you can guide my path when I'm running 'round like a fool
The stars align with the pyramids

Every king needs lovin' (Ooh)
Oh, baby, my queen
Your love is royalty (Oh na-na)
You're the one I wanted (Oh, baby)
Oh, baby, my queen (Queen)
Your love is royalty (Yeah)

And I will set your tempo, baby
If it's okay, if it's okay
And I wanna go and spend away, wherever you are, baby
Wherever you might be
I'm here as your servant (Oh, girl)
Ooh, my majesty (Ooh)
I'm doin' whatever you ask of me (You, hey, oh!)

This don't need explainin' (Oh, no-no)
This thing here, God made it (God made it)
Like the pyramids, like the pyramids (Oh)
This don't need explainin'
This thing here, God made it (Oh)
'Cause only you can guide my path when I'm running 'round like a fool
The stars align with the pyramids

This don't need explainin' (Ooh)
This thing here, God made it (Ooh)
Like the pyramids, like the pyramids (No)
This don't need explainin'
This thing here, God made it
'Cause only you can guide my path when I'm running 'round like a fool
The stars align with the pyramids
