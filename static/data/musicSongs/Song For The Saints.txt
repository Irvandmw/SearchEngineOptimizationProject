Lyrics:


Long before a boat anchored the harbor
Long before steel drums filled the breeze
God lifted these islands from the ocean
And they stood strong for centuries

So it's fitting they were named after men with golden halos
'Cause angels don't give in just 'cause a little wind blows

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood sweat and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singing a song for the saints

Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oh-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oh-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oh

For the farmer in the field of sugar cane
For the drunkard in his hammock drying out after the rain
For the teacher in the classroom, kid kicking cans in the street
For the captain and his barmaid praying down on bended knee

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood sweat and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singing a song for the saints

Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oh-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oh-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oh

This brokeness will heal
This weakness will be strong
Let's lift our voice together
As the saints go marching on

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood sweat and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singing a song for the...

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood sweat and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singing a song for the saints

Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oh-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oh-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oh

Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oh-oh
Whoa-oa-oa-oh
