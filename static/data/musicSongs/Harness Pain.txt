Lyrics:


You need to harness pain
To raise yourself up again
You need to harness pain 
And tell the truth about love

You need to break your heart
Before you can really start
You need to break your heart
And tell the truth about love

Then you need to set a goal that you can't reach
Then you have to attack defenses you can't breach
Then you need to lose and lose and lose again
If you want to hold the flame
You harness pain
You harness pain

You need to take your doubts
And spread them all about
You need to face your doubts
To tell the truth about love

You know the cliche's wrong
Hatred is just as strong
You know it's just as strong
Just as strong as love

So you need to take your hate and doubt and fear
Distill them through your word 'til they run clear
'Til they run right through your heart like Highland rain
If you want to hold the flame
You harness pain
You harness pain

Do you want to be the best or be well known?
Do you want to repeat lines or write your own?
Do you want to follow paths or blaze a trail?
When you try to succeed, You mostly fail
And you're gonna lose and lose and lose again
If you want to hold the flame
You harness pain
You harness pain
