Lyrics:


[Verse 1:]
Took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much to fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesnât last

[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ainât meant to be a play thing
Now I know itâs not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When itâs wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Verse 2:]
Remember when, we said our love would last forever
But then again, how are we to know
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But thereâll always be a first time you get burned

[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ainât meant to be a play thing
Now I know itâs not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When itâs wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Hook:]
I donât regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heartâs the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby canât you see
Itâs the way itâs gotta be

[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ainât meant to be a play thing
Now I know itâs not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing
When itâs wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah
Now I know
I know
