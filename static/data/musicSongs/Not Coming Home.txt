Lyrics:


I fell asleep, to the sound 
of the church bells ringing out 
In this quiet little town 
I am dreaming. 

I woke up to the sound 
of an angel crying out 
Gotta leave this little town 

Gotta move on 

Im not coming home, not coming home 
This Christmas I am all alone 
Im not coming home, not coming home 
I am out here on the road 

Im not coming home, not coming home 
This Christmas I am all alone 
Im not coming home, not coming home 
I am out here on the road 

Gotta phone-call from my son 
he said, dad, you're number one 
Mommy's going nuts, she thinks she's crazy 
put your mother on the phone 
I've gotta tell her she's not alone 
She's sick of waiting around 
Then I tell her these words 

Im not coming home, not coming home 
This Christmas I am all alone 
Im not coming home, not coming home 
I am out here on the road 

Im not coming home, not coming home 
This Christmas I am all alone 
Im not coming home, not coming home 
I am out here on the road 

Keep holding on, 
It wont be long 
but for now 

Im not coming home, not coming home 
This Christmas I am all alone 
Im not coming home, not coming home 
I am out here on the road 

Im not coming home, not coming home 
This Christmas I am all alone 
Im not coming home, not coming home 
I am out here on the road 

Keep holding on, 
It wont be long, 
but for now 

I'm not coming home
