Lyrics:


Hey girl, does your daddy know you're here
Does he know how much I wanna hold you near
And take you to the light

Hey girl, with the demon in your eyes
Don't you let them catch me in a compromise
I'm old enough for two of you tonight

Well are you really comin' home with me
Or are you holdin' out a fantasy
Do you wanna be alone with me
Little Miss American Dream

Hey girl, when the fire burns inside
It's a feelin' I just refuse to hide
So tell me it's alright

Hey girl, now you finally found your way
I can see that you don't have a lot to say
But say that you will stay with me tonight

Well are you really comin' home with me
Or is it just another fantasy
Do you wanna be alone with me
Little Miss American Dream
Little Miss American Dream
Little Miss American Dream

I guess I really want to show you
Just how much I want to hold you
Yes I really want to hold you
Little Miss American Dream

Well are you really comin' home with me
Or are you holdin' out a fantasy
Do you wanna be alone with me
Little Miss American Dream
Little Miss American Dream
Little Miss American Dream
