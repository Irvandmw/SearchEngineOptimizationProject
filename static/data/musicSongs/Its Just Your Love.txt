Lyrics:


Ooh, boy

All I think of us
Is your love and how you really knock me out for
You mean more to me than any gift that you can give
Because your love is what I live for

More than the fifty flowers you send me every hour
There is no only reason why I'm in love
It's just your love, your love, your love, your love

Oh, what a mystery
Loneliness was holding me and promise not to let me be, no
Then quite suddenly
Words are better, pleased to be, I think your love has saved me now
There are no world reasons, I've got a love attraction
If I could know the answer I would feel so much better
Maybe it's how you kissed me whenever you had missed me
So many whys to think of, it's what I knew
It's just your love, your love, oh oh, your love, your love

I still remember that day
You put my love pleased now
It was so cool and tender, that's why I still remember
If I have to name just one thing that makes my heart keep smiling
It wouldn't be hard to think of, I have to say it's just your love
Your love, your love, love, your love
It's your love, baby, your love

(Love) It is, it is, it is
(Love) It's your love, yeah, yeah
(Love) It's your love, ooh, ooh
(Love) Your love, yeah
(Love) Shoo-doo-be-doo-dwey-do
(Love) Doo-doo-doo-dwe, doo-doo-doo-dwe, doo-doo-doo-dwe, doo-doo-doo-dwe
(Love) It's your love
(Love) Oh, oh, your love
(Love) It's your love, yeah
