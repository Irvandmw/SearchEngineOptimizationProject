Lyrics:


Why the stars are lined up so perfectly
For everybody, but not for me?
I wish it could be easy
But it never goes that way
Itâs never like the movies
Itâs never like they say

Well, maybe one day Iâll be back on my feet
And all of this pain will be gone
And maybe it wonât be so hard to be me
And Iâll find out just where I belong
It feels like itâs taking forever
But one day things can get better
And maybe my time will come
And Iâll be the lucky one

Now I canât stop thinkinâ
How this life could be
I can keep pretendinâ
But honestly
Does it really make a difference?
Does it really ever change a thing?
Itâs never like the movies
Itâs never like you think

Oh, maybe one day Iâll be back on my feet
And all of this pain will be gone
And maybe it wonât be so hard to be me
And Iâll find out just where I belong
It feels like itâs taking forever
But one day things can get better
And maybe my time will come
And Iâll be the lucky one

So give me a reason to keep holdinâ on
Something that makes me believe that my lifeâs gonna change
Seems like everyone else gets a shot, gets a break
I canât wait for that to be me

Maybe one day Iâll be back on my feet
And all of this pain will be gone (all of this pain will be gone)
And maybe it wonât be so hard to be me
And Iâll find out just where I belong (Iâll find out just where I belong)

And maybe one day Iâll be back on my feet
And all of this pain will be gone
It feels like itâs taking forever
But one day things can get better
And maybe my time will come
And Iâll be the lucky one
And Iâll be the lucky one
