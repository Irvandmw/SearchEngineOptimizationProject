Lyrics:


I'm just a girl
That doesn't like the thought of being alone
I need to be loved and held real close
I'm the kind of girl
That needs to be caressed and kissed so soft
There's no better way to turn me on

I need a man whoâ
Who's gonna treat me right
I need a man
Who'll be with me every night
So I've gotta...

...find me a man
With sensitive eyes
One who understands
Love is stronger than pride
So I gotta find me a man
A sensitive mind
Not just any man
One of kind

I'm just a girl
That likes a man that knows his right from wrong
One that will keep his loving at home
I'm the kind of girl
Who likes to please her man the whole night long
But he's gotta please me just as long

I want a man whoâ
Who's gonna treat me right
I need a man who would be with me every night
So I gotta...

...find me a man
With sensitive eyes
One who understands
Love is stronger than pride
So I gotta find me a man
A sensitive mind
Not just any man
One of a kind

Oh, baby

Know what I'm looking for,
And I know he's gotta be wonderful,
'Cause I know I am too beautiful
To settle for nothânothing less
Know what I'm searching for,
Yes I know, someone incredible,
Don't you know I won't give up
Until I've found the [?] perfect man
So I...

I gotta find me
Gotta find me a guy
Someone to blow my mind
So I gotta find me, find me, find me a man
Not just any man
One of a kind
