Lyrics:


Added to their thirteen colonies Tennessee, Vermont, Kentucky
Louisiana and Ohio and Mississippi and Indiana Alabama Maine Missouri
Added Arakansas and Michigan added Florida and Texas
And in Texas five thousand men under Santa Anna
Had crossed the Rio Grande headed for San Antonio
David Crockett left Tennessee with the volunteers headed for San Antonio
At a Spanish mission near San Antonio they met a knife-fighter
And a gambler named Jim Bowie and a Britisher named Travis
One hundred eighty Americans against five thousand to the death
