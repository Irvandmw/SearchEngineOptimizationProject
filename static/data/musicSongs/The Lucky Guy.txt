Lyrics:


And I'm the lucky one
I'm a lucky guy
When it comes to love
You're the reason why
You're the reason why
We've been having fun
When it comes to love
I'm the lucky one

You're a silver swirl
And a crystal maze
You're a lazy girl
On a silken shade
You're a royal flush
And a string of pearls
You're a champagne blush
And you're the best of girls

And I'm the lucky one
I'm a lucky guy
When it comes to love
You're the reason why
You're the reason why
We've been having fun
When it comes to love
I'm the lucky one

You're a [?]
And pretty blue high heels
You're a chingeling
Oh with a diamond ring
You got a tender touch
And a searching eye
And you're much too much
For any other guy

And I'm the lucky one
I'm a lucky guy
When it comes to love
You're the reason why
You're the reason why
We've been having fun
When it comes to love
I'm the lucky one

When it comes to love
I'm the lucky one
Yeah when it comes to love
I'm the lucky one
