Lyrics:


I left home when I was only 17
Met a guy, he and I drove down to New Orleans
He seemed to know his way around, I thought that I could land
That sweet talking candy man
(Sweet talking candy man)
(Sweet talking candy man)

I warmed his bed and I kept him fed
Oh, I loved him so
And I sure did cry a lot whenever he would go
I guess I was just too young to ever understand
A sweet talking candy man
(Sweet talking candy man)
(Sweet talking candy man)

He played around, he put me down, finally threw me out
I got burned and I really learned what life was all about
But I find I still think about him every now and then
That sweet talking candy man
(Sweet talking candy man)
(Sweet talking candy man)
Candy man

I warmed his bed and I kept him fed
Oh, I loved him so
And I sure did cry a lot whenever he would go
But I guess I was just too young to really understand
A sweet talking candy man
(Sweet talking candy man)
(Sweet talking candy man)
Candy man

(Sweet talking candy man)
(Sweet talking candy man)
Candy man
(Sweet talking candy man)
(Sweet talking candy man)
Candy man
(Sweet talking candy man)
(Sweet talking candy man)
Candy man
(Sweet talking candy man)
(Sweet talking candy man)
Candy man
