Lyrics:


I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with a girl
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl
But she don't give a darn about me
To make her love me I tried
How I sighed and I cried
But she just refused
And ever since she's gone away
I've got those lovesick blues

Got the feeling called the "blue hoo's,"
Since my sweetie said "Good Bye"
Seems I don't know what to "Do Hoo"
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me, filled me
With a kind of lovin'
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"
Twas just a beautiful dream

I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome
And get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's

Got the feeling called the "blue hoo's,"
Since my sweetie said "Good Bye"
Seems I don't know what to "Do Hoo"
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me, filled me
With a kind of lovin'
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream

I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome
And get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's
