Lyrics:


I can't seem to find my peace of mind
Lately I still tell myself you're mine
And I couldn't ask for more
The first time, not the last time I saw you

I would hold you closer but I know
The more I pull, the more you let go
And I can't say you'd be the same
The first time, not the last time I saw you

So I hold you too close
I had to phone now, it's your move
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately
And it's the way that you move
You wear my pride from your head to your shoes
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately

I can't stop looking down at my phone
Keep you on, that's all I've ever known
And I fucked up, that much is true
The last time, not the first time I saw you

Tell me something that I don't already know, yeah
I love your way from your fingers to your toes, yeah
I've been trippin', I've been high, I've been low, yeah
The way you're talking really got me confused
How close am I to losing you right now?

So I hold you too close
I had to phone now, it's your move
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately
And it's the way that you move
You wear my pride from your head to your shoes
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately

Oh, tell me that you're never gonna leave me
Fucked it up, you make it look easy
I can't lie, you fooled me one too many times
Well, tell me that you're always gonna be around
My pride is lost but my love is found

So I hold you too close
I had to phone now, it's your move
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately
And it's the way that you move
You wear my pride from your head to your shoes
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately
Oh Lord, I've been on fire lately
