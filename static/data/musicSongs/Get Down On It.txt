Lyrics:


What you gonna do?
Blue gonna get down?
What you gonna do?
Blue gonna get down?
What you gonna do?
Blue gonna get down?
What you gonna do?

Get down on it, c'mon and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it, get down on it

Get down on it, c'mon and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it

How you gonna do it
If you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall
Get your back off the wall
Tell me
How you gonna do it
If you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall
'Cause I heard all my people saying

Get down on it, c'mon and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it, get down on it

Get down on it, c'mon and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it

I say, "People!"
âWhat?
"What you gonna do?"
You've gotta get on the groove, yeah
If you want your body to move

Tell me, baby

How you gonna do it
If you really don't want to dance
By standing on the wall
(Get your back up off the wall)

Tell me

How you gonna do it
If you really won't take a chance
By standing on the wall
Get your back off the the wall
'Cause I heard all the people saying

Get down on it, c'mon and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it, get down on it

Get down on it, c'mon and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it

You know it when you're dancing, yeah
You show it when you move, move, move
You know it when you're dancing, yeah
You show it as you move across the floor

When I move you move just like that
It's your girl little Kim on the throw back
I'm just cooling out me and the gang
Girls pop that thing and get down on it
If you really want it got the feeling
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Get down on it down

I said move like that
What you mean like this
Kool and the gang,
Blue and little Kim
We all teamed up for this collaboration
But we're gon' turn it into a celebration
If your sitting I suggest All Rise
I got 8 bass so I'mma spit in time
So don't feel Guilty
Just 'cause you're with me
Back off the wall ya, One Love

We gotta get down now
We gotta get down now
(What you gonna do?)
We're taking you down now
We're taking down now
(What you gonna do?)
Get down on it
(You wanna get down?)

Get down on it. [repeat with ad-libs until the end]
