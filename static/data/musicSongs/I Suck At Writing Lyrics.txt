Lyrics:


Its 10 p.m. and I am missing
My seventh song for December second
My minds gone blank
I can not think clear
About the lyrics
for this God damn song here

How do people have the attention span
To go and do this
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits

It's 12 a.m. and I am so screwed
Looking up at people falling on YouTube
Getting so bored to the highest degree
This much be so easy for Kenny G

How do people have the attention span
To go and do this
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits

Another sappy love song
My listeners will be pissed
I would seriously pay someone
Right now to go and help me with this

Da da da da da da da
This is the chorus line
Da da da da da da da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics

I suck
At writing lyrics

How do people have enough
Motivation to go and do this
Feels like a day in this chair
And I haven't written down shit
Feel like I'm running out of ideas
For all these pieces
And every time I try to get done
Procrastination increases

Da da da da da da da
This is the chorus line
Da da da da da da da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics
