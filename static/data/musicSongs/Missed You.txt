Lyrics:


Convinced myself to run around with someone else to forget about you
But I can't hold you responsible for the things I do
I said your name by mistake
Played it off like I'm just confused
But I was frontin', lyin' to myself
When I know the truth

Was I missed you
Yes, it's true
I should've known not to let you go, let you go
'Cause I missed you
Baby boo
We could've grown if I held you close, held you close

I hurt myself a hundred times just to feel something in my soul
I kept knocking even though I knew what's behind that door
But then I heard you call my name and it sounded like the sweetest song
You never moved on, you were waiting for me all along

Well, I missed you
Yes, it's true
Should've known not to let you go, let you go
Well, I missed you
Baby boo
We could've grown if I held you close, held you close

Oh, I missed you
Yes, it's true
Should've known not to let you go, let you go
Girl, I missed you
Baby boo
We could've grown if I held you close, held you close
Well, I missed you
