Lyrics:


Your smile
Will always be one of my favorite things
Like backyard barbecues and front porch swings
An evenin' breeze
Through a window screen.

Your smile
Makes me feel just like a child inside
Like Christmas mornin' sparkling red and bright
And Grandpa's pipe,
And my first bike

Your smile
Like daylight dripping through the mountain pines,
Pure sunshine, summertime,
Your smile
Like a wheat field in the southern breeze,
Apple trees,
Sweet and ripe

Your smile
So much joy from such a simple thing,
Like an old wheelbarrow filled with summer rain,
A blue sky day,
And sun on my face

And your smile

Your smile
Like daylight dripping through the mountain pines,
Pure sunshine,
Summertime,
Your smile
Like a wheat field in the southern breeze,
Apple trees,
Sweet and ripe

Your smile
Right there with butter beans and cherry pie,
And all the other simple joys of life,
That warm my heart
And make it all worth-while.

Your smile
