Lyrics:


Whenever I dream a blue dream
I barely sleep at night
I'm just waiting for the morning light
Whenever I dream a blue dream
I wake up in a haze
Trying to chase your memory away

Deep blue dream
Blue as I have ever seen

Whenever I dream a blue dream
It seems to never die
Like a stream running through my mind

Deep blue dream
Blue as I have ever seen

Whenever I dream a blue dream
I barely sleep at night
Deep blue dream
Blue as I have ever seen
