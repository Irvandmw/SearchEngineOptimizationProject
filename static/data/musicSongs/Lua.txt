Lyrics:


I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk
Waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actorâs west side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening, by the morning theyâll be gone.

When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit.

And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me Iâm not a gamble you can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning wonât exist.

Youâre looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
You just keep going to the bathroom always say youâll be right back
Well it takes one to know one, kid, I think youâve got it bad
But whatâs so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag.

Iâve got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
If you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
We might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane.

And Iâm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did
Itâs not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is
