Lyrics:


And don't forget that I'll be watching you
And the meaning of your motives will come shining through.
Is it a warning? Is it an evil sign? Is it a people
Who had lost their mind? Is it the darkness?
Is it a man resigned? Is it a best friend leaving you behind?

And don't forget that I'll be watching you,
And the meaning of your motives will come shining through...

Is it a warning? Is it an evil sign? Is it a people
Who had lost their mind? Is it the darkness?
Is it a man resigned? Is it a best friend leaving you behind?
Is it a good thing? Is it a gift in kind?
Is it a prophet with a one-track mind? Is it the finish? 
Is it a fearful find? Is it the center 
As your brain unwinds?

Don't go where you been before, don't go sleeping on a floor
Don't go down on dirty whore
Don't lose yourself 
Don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself

Is it evil? Is it gonna make u sick?
Is now a time that you realize that you better get out quick?
Is it hunger? Is it making you feel pain?
Did you give your all, 'cause you're only small and now your body's drained?
Is it ever gonna stop? Will they ever let you go?
You're in a rush, they don't care enough, and they're thinking very slow...
Time is ticking on; we don't get a second shot.
And in 60 years, we gotta face our fears and show the cards we've got...

Don't go where you been before, don't go sleeping on the floor
Don't go down on dirty whore
Don't lose yourself 
Don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself
Don't lose yourself
