Lyrics:


[Nija & (BeyoncÃ©)]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way, oh wow (Boma, boma yÃ©)
They feel a way, oh wow (Boma, boma yÃ©)
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way, oh wow (Boma, boma yÃ©)
They feel a way, oh wow (Boma, boma yÃ©)

[Tierra Whack:]
I was always in the lead
Where you wanna be, I'm who they wanna be
B-E-A-U-T-Y, he never seen so much rage from a queen
Rage from a queen, queen so strong, thought she was a machine
Girl of your dreams, Sinclair regime
Turned to the max, can't forget Maxine
Refer to me as a goddess, I'm tired of being modest
A hundred degrees, the hottest, if we being honest
Ebony and ebonics, black people win
They say we bein' demonic, angel in disguise
I hate I have to disguise it, why you gotta despise it?
Rich in the mind, that's why I'm making deposits
Can't we all empower? It's time to realize it
They'll never, ever take my power

[Nija:]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way, oh wow
They feel a way, oh wow
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way (Hold up), oh wow (Wow, wow, wow)
They feel a way (Woo), oh wow (Wow, wow, wow)

[BeyoncÃ©:]
This that rhythm, this that lightning
This that burn, this ain't no perm
This that nappy, this that urb
This that kinfolk, this that skinfolk
This that war, this that bloodline
On the front line, ready for war
Where you gon' run?
Get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Why you get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Oh, gotta protect my braids
Keep it locked in a safe
Don't make me get back to my ways
My power, they'll never take

[Nija & {BeyoncÃ©}:]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
{They'll never take my power}
They feel a way, oh wow (Wow, wow, wow, wow)
They feel a way (Woo), oh wow (Wow, wow)
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
{They'll never take my power}
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
{They'll never take my power, power}
They feel a way, oh wow
They feel a way, oh wow

[Busiswa:]
Woza
Vumani Bo (Siyavuma!)
Selingenile ikumkani
Ningangabazi amandla am
Ngizogobisa abanenkani
Thulani Bo (Seng'hleli)
Selivukile idimoni lami
Nibabuzile abaziyo ngami
There will be niks when I'm done
Jongani Bo (Siyabona)
Ndim' ne-Skeem Sami
Sizilethile izikhali
Amagwali awahlangani
Hlalani Bo (Ibamb'umthetho)
Niyayibona inkinga lento
Sizoyilungisa, themba mina
Qoqa amaqhawe soyiqeda manje

[Nija:]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way (Ayy), oh wow (Wow, wow)
They feel a way (Ayy), oh wow (Wow, wow)
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power (Ayy)
They feel a way (Ayy), oh wow (Wow, wow)
They feel a way (Ayy), oh wow (Wow, wow)

[Yemi Alade & Moonchild Sanelly:]

Boom, boom, check you later

Andoyiki, nenja
