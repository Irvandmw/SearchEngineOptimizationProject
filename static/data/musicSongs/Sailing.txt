Lyrics:


Well it's not far down to paradise
At least not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Baby believe me 

It's not far to Never-Never Land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Baby believe me

Sailing takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and a wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing 

All the world in a reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing (takes me away) takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be (where I wanna be)
Just a dream and a wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
Soon I will be free 

Ahhh....

It's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if he wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity
The canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Baby, believe me

Sailing takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and a wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
Soon I will be free (FREE!)

Sailing takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be (I've always heard it could be)
Just a dream and a wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
Soon I will be free yeah.
