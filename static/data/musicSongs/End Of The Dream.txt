Song Name: End Of The Dream
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
And I remember why I know this place

I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me

As much as it hurts,
Ainât it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart 'til it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Iâm not afraid
I pushed through the pain
And Iâm on fire
I remember how to breathe again

As much as it hurts,
Ainât it wonderful to feel?

So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart 'til it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly?
I will find a way
Even without wings
Follow your heart
'Til it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Follow your heart
'Til it bleeds
And weâve gone to the end of the dream
