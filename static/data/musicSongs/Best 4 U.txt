Lyrics:


I just want the best for you

Yeah another night out
I get drunk, I get high
Then you call and I lie
And say I'm on my way now
Yeah I say I'm on my way now

Show up when it's light out
When you're dressing for work
And I'm mumbling words
I don't know what to say now
No, I don't know what to say now

You tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt you
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

No oh-oh-oh no baby
No oh-oh-oh no baby
No oh-oh-oh oh baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

Parties with shots and powder
But, you'd rather sleep eight hours
And I know you got your doubts
'Cause I can't turn this life around, baby
Thought it was just a phase
'Til I woke up a thousand days later
Realizing I'm the same
As I was before I saw your face

You tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt you
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

No oh-oh-oh no baby
No oh-oh-oh no baby
No oh-oh-oh oh baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

No oh-oh-oh no baby
No oh-oh-oh no baby
No oh-oh-oh oh baby
I just want the best for you

You tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times (I just want)
It's gonna hurt you
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

I just want the best for you (oooh)
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you (for you)
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
But I'm just not the best for you (I'm not the best for you)
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

No oh-oh-oh no baby (oh)
No oh-oh-oh no baby
No oh-oh-oh oh baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

No oh-oh-oh no baby (yeah)
No oh-oh-oh no baby (yeah)
No oh-oh-oh oh baby
I just want the best for you

Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
I just want the best for you
Oooh
