Lyrics:


My Sugar's gone from Sugar Hill
Love's old sweet song has lost its thrill
She was my lover until another
Stole my honey flashin' twenty dollar bills

Oh the Jasmine blooms (Jasmine blooms)
All around my door (around my door)

But the sweet perfume (sweet perfume)
Ain't sweet no more (sweet no more)
I'll face tomorrow with bitter sorrow
Cause my sugar's gone gone from that hill

Oh the Jasmine blooms (Jasmine blooms)
All around my door (around my door)

But the sweet perfume (sweet perfume)
Ain't sweet no more (sweet no more)
I'll face tomorrow with bitter sorrow
Cause my sugar's gone from sugar hill

Cause my sugar's gone gone from sugar hill
