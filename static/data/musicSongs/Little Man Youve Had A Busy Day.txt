Lyrics:


I know why you're cryin', I know why you're blue
Someone took your kiddy-car away
Time to go to sleep now
Little man, you've had a busy day

Someone took your marbles, tell you what I'll do
Dad'll get you new ones right away
Time to go to sleep now
Little man, you've had a busy day

Put away your soldiers, the battle has been won
Enemy is out of sight
Come along there soldier, and put away your gun
The war is over for tonight

Time to stop your schemin', time your day was through
Listen to the jukebox softly play
It's time to go to sleep now
Little man, you've had a busy day

Time to stop your schemin', time your day was through
Listen to the jukebox softly say
It's time to go to sleep now
Little man, you've had a busy day
It's time to go to sleep now
Little man, you've had a busy day
