Lyrics:


Mmm yeah you burn me again
Well I don't wanna know where you've been
Mmm ahhh, How was a new best friend
Do you know I'll treat you like them?

And I know oh, oh,

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo
On my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo
To remind me

(Ooh)
A tattoo to remind me
[x2]

Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin, no I
I couldn't live without you

Mmm, Tears and eyes can try
But I know
Burning like the wire in lightbulbs
It could be in the way you bleed me

And I know oh, oh

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo
On my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo
To remind me

(Ooh)
A tattoo to remind me
[x2]

See these scars leaving blood on my little white dress
Beating hearts, screaming out loud

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo
On my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you have to leave a tattoo
To remind me

(Ooh)
A tattoo to remind me
[x2]

Under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way you loved me
I guess you had to leave a tattoo
To remind me
