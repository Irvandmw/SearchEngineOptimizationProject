Lyrics:


[instrumental opening]

I was young and foolish,
When I fell in love with you...
Not too wise in the ways of the world
Was I...
Young and foolish
Were the things I used to do,
Oh what silly tricks I would try!

I've changed my mind about many things,
Things I never knew before...
But though I've changed my mind about many things,
As time goes by,
I love you more!

If it was young and foolish,
To fall in love with you,
And to love you with all my heart as I do,
Let me be young and foolish...
My whole life through!

(if it was young and foolish,
To fall in love with you,
And to love you with all my heart as I do...)
Let me be young and foolish...
My whole life through!

I'll be young and foolish...
My whole life through!
