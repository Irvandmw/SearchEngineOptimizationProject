Lyrics:


Stand beside me, stand beside me
You're the only one whoever made me care
I can't stand to think that I might be alone
Not alone again, not the way it was back then . . .
Before you walked into my heart
An' told me we would never part
So stand beside, don't ever let me be alone again!

Stand beside me, stand beside me
Or if I should lose you I just couldn't . . .
Get anywhere . . .
Stand beside me, stand beside me
You're the only one whoever made me care

I know there'll be times when everything goes wrong

But darling I won't care
If I know you're standin' there!
No matter what we have to do
Together we can see it through
So stand beside me, an' I'll be standin' right there next to you!

Stand beside me, stand beside me
Or if I should lose you I just couldn't . . .
Get anywhere . . .
Stand beside me, stand beside me
You're the only one whoever made me care

You're the only one
Whoever made me care . . .
