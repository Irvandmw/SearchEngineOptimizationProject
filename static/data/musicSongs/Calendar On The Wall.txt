Lyrics:


Days - no need to count their number
No need to keep a record like the calendar on the wall
Days - devoid of all ambition
Sitting in the kitchen with the calendar on the wall

These are the happy days of boredom
They excite me through and through
Days when I don't mind admitting
How much I hate the kitten on the calendar on the wall

These are the happy days of boredom
They excite me through and through
Ohh, days - no need to count their number
No need to keep a record like the calendar on the wall
No need to keep a record like the calendar on the wall
