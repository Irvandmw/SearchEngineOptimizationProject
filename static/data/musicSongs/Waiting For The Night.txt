Lyrics:


Baby I know youâre outside
In here itâs warm and dry
Got feelings that Iâve got to try expressing
Like a language that I share with you
Letâs talk in the special way we do
Donât want to be anywhere else but here with you
Feels so good

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I canât help, help myself at all
I canât hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I canât help, help myself from falling
So Iâm waiting for the night

Baby I know itâs late
Weâve got decisions to make
Think of what we could create together
And with you I am never afraid
To play with the highest stakes
Nobody could break my rapture

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I canât help, help myself at all
I canât hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I canât help, help myself from falling
So Iâm waiting for the night

I canât control it in the night, night, night
Itâs when Iâve got you on my mind, mind, mind
Cuz youâre the twinkle in my eye, eye, eye
Iâve got to get you in my life, life, life
Canât think of nothing worse than being lonely
I think youâre the right choice for one and only
Weâre running out of time so baby hold me
Days go by

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I canât help, help myself at all
I canât hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I canât help, help myself from falling
So Iâm waiting for the night

Iâm waiting, Iâm waiting, Iâm waiting
Iâm waiting, Iâm waiting, Iâm waiting
Waiting for the night
Yeah, I really want to see you yeah 
I really want to see you tonight
Donât keep me waiting waiting, 
donât keep me waiting for the night
