Lyrics:


Sundays sitting on your back porch
And I came armed with a couple of chords
And I played for you
You let me keep you entertained
With stories I exaggerate
That you know aren't true
And as you sit there making daisy chains
And I throw in a hand grenade
And tell you how it is I really feel for you

I'm sending postcards from my heart
With love for a postmark and then
You'll know that you make me
Feel like we've been caught
Like kids in the school-yard again
And I can't keep it to myself
Can't spell it any better
L-O-V-E forever
I hope you know that I'm
Sending a postcard
I don't care who sees what I've said
Or if the whole world knows what's in my head

We chased the sun till it got away
On a bicycle that your Daddy made
But not made for two
Then we sat out on your rocking chair
You with a flower in your hair that I found for you
But then Monday always comes around
And it's sad coz I can't see you now
I want you to know you're always in my head

I'm sending postcards from my heart
With love for a postmark and then
You'll know that you make me
Feel like we've been caught
Like kids in the school-yard again
And I can't keep it to myself
Can't spell it any better
L-O-V-E forever
I hope you know that I'm
Sending a postcard
I don't care who sees what I've said
Or if the whole world knows what's in my head

You know sometimes it's hard to see
Or say the words that torture me
But inside I know exactly how I feel
The things that I can't say outloud
I'll find a place to write it down
I hope that they will find you in the end

I'm sending postcards from my heart
With love for a postmark and then
You'll know that you make me
Feel like we've been caught
Like kids in the school-yard again
And I can't keep it to myself
Can't spell it any better
L-O-V-E forever
I hope you know that I'm
Sending a postcard
I don't care who sees what I've said
Or if the whole world knows what's in my head

Know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know
