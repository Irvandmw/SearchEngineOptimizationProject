Lyrics:


Listen to the monkey
Feedin' on your brain
I feel okay, no pain
I'm tired of shocking junkie
Suckin' on your veins
Forget no way, no ways
I'm tired of runnin' hunchback
I've been tripping now for days
And there is no way, you don't say
I got my drip drab velcro moustache
Keeps them all at bay
Get yours some day, oh, yeah

'Cause we don't love our paycheck
Battle up your date
Don't get no love, no love
Double takes for feelin'
And empty realities
'Cause can't get no love, get no love
C'mon like eyeball tickler
Get up of your knees
And smile above, above

Listen to the monkey
Feedin' on your brain
I feel okay, no pain
I'm tired of shocking junkie
Suckin' on your veins
Forget no ways, no ways
Desire all you want
But you got what you need
Not too much, too much
