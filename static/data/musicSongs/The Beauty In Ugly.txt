Lyrics:


Sheâs so big hearted
But not so remarkable
Just an ordinary humble girl
Expecting nothing as weâre made to think
Itâs a pretty personâs world

But you are beautiful
And you better go show it
So go look again
You gotta be true to your own
If you really wanna go to the top
Do you really wanna win
Donât believe in leaving normal
Just to satisfy demand

Well if you wanna get free
And if you wanna do the passionate thing
And if you wanna get smart
For the sake of your heart and all
You should own your name
And stand up tall and get real
And see the beauty in ugly

Well you are fresh
Your face is fabulous
Donât forget youâre one of a kind
When nobodyâs checking the deeds youâve done
And nobodyâs hearing your cries
You make all the fashion statements
Just by dressing up your mind

And if you wanna get free
And if you wanna do the passionate thing
And if you wanna get smart
For the sake of your heart and all
You should own your name
And stand up tall and get real
And see the beauty in ugly
See the beauty in ugly

Well if you wanna get free
And if you wanna do the passionate thing
And if you wanna get smart
For the sake of your heart and all
You should own your name
And stand up tall and get real
And see the beauty in ugly
