Lyrics:


You were someone 
Who I could talk to
If I wanted to

You're one of a kind 
If one of a kind means
That you were the only one

And I really 
Don't even think you see
All the things 
You've done for me

And I will never forget 
As long as I live
And even after I'm gone
Cause then I'll be with you

You never left me alone
My sweet unknown

So sweet
You're so unknown
You could see 
Right through me

Sweet unknown
Sweet unknown
Sweet unknown
Sweet unknown

You were someone 
Who I could talk to
If I wanted to

You're one of a kind
If one of a kind means
That you are the only one

And I 
Don't even think you see
All the things 
You've done for me

And I will never forget
As long as I live
And even after I'm gone
Cause then I'll be with you

You never left me alone
My sweet unknown

So sweet
You're so unknown
You could see 
Right through me

Sweet unknown
Sweet unknown

You sent your angels 
To watch over me
And I feel them

I never wanted 
To be further away
From the length 
Of your arms

Show and tell 
Is caving in
These angry feelings 
From within

Hold me tight 
And don't let go 
Of my hand
Promise me so

Promise me so
Promise me so
