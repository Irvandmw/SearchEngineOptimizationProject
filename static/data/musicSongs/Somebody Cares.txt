Lyrics:


Somebody cares, 
When your heart is feeling blue, 
As you climb your lonely stair, 
Somebody cares! 

Somebody knows, 
When each dream falls through, 
Though you think it never shows, 
Somebody knows! 

Somebody hears, 
Every wish you make, 
As you fall asleep in tears, 

Somebody hears! 

Somebody knew, 
How I needed someone's love, 
Then I looked and there was you, 
Somebody knew! 

Somebody heard my prayers, 
Somebody cares!
