Lyrics:


Let me tell you 'bout the birds the bees and the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above and a thing called love
Let me tell you 'bout the stars in the sky, a girl and a guy
And the way they could kiss on a night like this

When I look into your big brown eyes it's so very plain to see
That it's time you learned about the facts of life startin' from A to Z
Let me tell you bout the birds and the bees, the flowers and the trees
The moon up above and a thing called love
When I look into your big brown eyes...

Let me tell you 'bout the birds the bees and the flowers and the trees
The stars in the sky, a girl and a guy
The birds the bees and the flowers and the trees
The stars in the sky, a girl and a guy
