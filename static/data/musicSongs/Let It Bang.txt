Lyrics:


[Jackie Long:]
We gon' let it bang
Money over everythang
Pull up in a new whip
Every night, Jackie Long got a new bitch
TMG, no extras
Pretty ladies wanna sex us
Shoutout to my investors
Niggas wanna hate 'cause the good Lord blessed us

[Ray J:]
Niggas yellin' what's up Blood?
And the ladies 'bout to get real twisted
It's about to go down in the club
And my nigga Chris Brown brought the bitches
All these bad bitches gettin' fucked up
VIP, got a lot of pretty women
My nigga Truth snuck in with the slug
And we gon' let it bang just for all you fuck niggas

Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Oh

Girl, do your thing, that's my only one wish
I hope that pussy taste like Herseys Kisses
All up in the club with a lot of pretty bitches
And my niggas stay strapped just for all you fuck niggas, yeah
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
And I know you wanna do it the same

[Jackie Long:]
Real niggas from the West side
Real niggas from the East side, yeah
Real niggas from the North side
South side, it don't matter where you at, what's up?
[Ray J:]
Niggas yellin' what's up Blood?
And the ladies 'bout to get real twisted
It's about to go down in the club
And my nigga Chris Brown brought the bitches
All these bad bitches gettin' fucked up
VIP, got a lot of pretty women
My nigga Truth snuck in with the slug
And we gon' let it bang just for all you fuck niggas

Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Oh

[Jackie Long:]
Huh, look, let it bang like a new gang
Lit like a new flame, kickin' it like Liu Kang
I'm different but I got on way more than 2 Chainz
I'm standin' out like a bright blue flame
Look, look, light blue Bentley
Want a bad bitch so boujee and prissy
A Blood bitch crazy, hood name Brissy
Fuck me every night like she miss me
Straight from the jungle, it's pretty face but she still humble
Right jab still make a broke bitch stumble
Trick nigga, make a broke bitch rich
I can bang that, nigga, they gon' bang this

[Ray J:]
Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Oh

[Jackie Long:]
Real niggas from the West side
Real niggas from the East side, yeah
Real niggas from the North side
South side, it don't matter where you at, what's up?
[Ray J:]
Niggas yellin' what's up Blood?
And the ladies 'bout to get real twisted
It's about to go down in the club
And my nigga Chris Brown brought the bitches
All these bad bitches gettin' fucked up
VIP, got a lot of pretty women
My nigga Truth snuck in with the slug
And we gon' let it bang just for all you fuck niggas

Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Oh

[Truth KO:]
Huh, let it bang, let it bang
Where them head at? Let it rain, let it rain
Young Truth, baby girl, I do the damn thing
Ciroc for the bitches while I'm drinkin' champagne
Came with the snug, where the heat be at?
OHB in the bitch, where CB at?
This a couple real niggas inside the squad
It don't matter what side, worldwide the mob

[Ray J:]
Niggas yellin' what's up Blood?
And the ladies 'bout to get real twisted
It's about to go down in the club
And my nigga Chris Brown brought the bitches
All these bad bitches gettin' fucked up
VIP, got a lot of pretty women
My nigga Truth snuck in with the slug
And we gon' let it bang just for all you fuck niggas

Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Oh

Girl, do your thing, that's my only one wish
I hope that pussy taste like Herseys Kisses
All up in the club with a lot of pretty bitches
And my niggas stay strapped just for all you fuck niggas, yeah
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
And I know you wanna do it the same

[Payso B:]
Yeah, yeah, let it bang, let it bang
VIP lit, yeah, we brought the whole gang
Ray J, Truth, Jack Long and Payso
Throwin' money up, I just spent a bankroll
Came here to have a good time
But if a nigga trippin', we gon' let the lights shine
All the pretty ladies came to see what we doin'
10G gang, gettin' money and she knew it

[Ray J:]
Niggas yellin' what's up Blood?
And the ladies 'bout to get real twisted
It's about to go down in the club
And my nigga Chris Brown brought the bitches
All these bad bitches gettin' fucked up
VIP, got a lot of pretty women
My nigga Truth snuck in with the slug
And we gon' let it bang just for all you fuck niggas

Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Oh

Girl, do your thing, that's my only one wish
I hope that pussy taste like Herseys Kisses
All up in the club with a lot of pretty bitches
And my niggas stay strapped just for all you fuck niggas, yeah
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
And I know you wanna do it the same

Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it
Oh
