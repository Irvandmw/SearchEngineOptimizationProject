Lyrics:


Well I never should have turned my head
To see some other lovely thing
Walking pretty down the street
'Cause just about that time my girl she realized
Caught my eyes and busted me
Now I'm back out in this bed I made face down in the dirt
Beggin' to get my baby back, you think I would have learned

[Chorus]
It's just another day in the dog house
I better change my ways and my wandering eyes
It's just another day in the doghouse
Thinking this is probably where this dog is gonna die

I stumbled in at 3am
After poker night with my friends
She was waiting up and angry
I said honey I lost track of time, not to mention every dime
That I had on me
Now I'm back out in the yard and sad and all alone
If you find forgiveness in your heart just throw this boy a bone

[Repeat Chorus]

Now I'm back out in this bed I made face down in the dirt
Beggin' to get my baby back, you think I would have learned
