Lyrics:


Say you wanna walk away 
You ain't got nothing to say 
I salute you 
Go on out the door, 
Now, you take care 
No more tears to shed 
What? You expected me to beg, 
Well, I'm not, I'm done
So when you leave just close the door behind you, 

'Cause I'm feeling kind of taller than you, lately
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of better than you, 
And I know just what to do, 
I feel like doing my hair 
I feel like calling some of my friends 
I feel like going to a club and partying 

'Cause I'm a soldier girl in this world 
I stand alone, I can be strong
I walk the miles, I made it home
It's good to know without you I made it 

Soldier girl in my world 
I took the fall, now I stand tall 
From the pain and all, I made it through 
And now all I gotta say to you 
Salute
Salute

You think you know everything,
And you think that your shit don't stink, 
Well, it do. Yeah 
And when it comes to me, 
You don't have a clue 

Took me all these years, 
To realise that you don't belong here 
I can do better, 
You say I'll never do better 
Yeah, right. Whatever 

'Cause I'm feeling kind of taller than you, lately
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, lately 
I'm feeling kind of better than you, 
And I know just what to do 
I feel like doing my hair 
I feel like calling some of my friends, my girlfriends 
I feel like going to a club, do some partying

'Cause I'm a soldier girl in this world 
I stand alone, I can be strong 
I walk the miles, I made it home 
It's good to know without you I made it 

Soldier girl in my world, in this world 
I took the fall now I stand tall 
From the pain and all, I made it through 
And now all I gotta say to you 
Salute
I salute you

So don't call it a come-back, no
I've been here for years, yeah
Through all of the drama and the pain 
And all of the tears 

Time to stop this roller-coaster, 
See I wanna get off,
And start moving mountains, swimming seas, 
And climbing over walls 

'Cause I'm a soldier girl in this world 
I stand alone, I can be strong 
I walked the miles, I made it home 
It's good to know (i salute you, i salute you) without you I made it

Soldier girl in my world 
I took the fall now I stand tall 
From the pain and all, I made it through 
And now all I gotta to say to you 
I salute you
I salute you

Salute, salute, salute
I salute you
Go on take care
Go on out the door
Now you take care
