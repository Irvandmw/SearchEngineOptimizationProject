Lyrics:


If you donât think
You can trust anybodyâs love in this world
Darlinâ trust mine

If you donât think
You can trust anybodyâs love in this world
Darlinâ trust mine

Because it means so much to me
For you to know that Iâm real
Iâll stand by your side
And our love will be our shield

If you donât think
You can trust anybodyâs love in this world
Darlinâ trust mine

I know youâve had many disappointments
Itâs in the making of the world going âround
Happiness and heartaches share the same bed
The happy sideâs where my love can be found

Oh darlinâ, it means so much for me to find
Lord, help me find your love
And Iâll keep on trying
Under the sun that shines above

If you donât think
You can trust anybodyâs love in this world
Trust mine

It means so much to me
For us to find each otherâs love
And Iâll keep on trying
Under the sun that shines above

If you donât think
You can trust anybodyâs love in this world
Trust mine
