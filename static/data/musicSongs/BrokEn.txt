Lyrics:


If I caught you the star
Would you love me the way you used to
And if I brought you the sun
would you smile once again

Cause when I gave you my heart
I didn't know it will be yours forever
And if I could go back in time
I'd have no regrets I'll be a fool for you

[Chorus]
All of the words I was dying to say
Never came out the right away
I'm looking for somethin' I'd never replace
you're the reason, the reason that I
I pick up the pieces of my heart 
Girl every moment we're apart
The pain endless
I keep mend this
Broken broken broken broken heart
If you can read my thoughts

You'll see, I never meant to lose you
And if you can feel my heart
Then you would know
Just how it beats for you

[Chorus]
All of the words I was dying to say
Never came out the right away
I'm looking for somethin' I'd never replace
you're the reason, the reason that I
[x2]
Pick up the pieces of my heart 
Girl every moment we're apart
The pain endless
I keep mend this
Broken broken broken broken heart

I'm trying to pick up the pieces I couldn't see
Tears tolling down falling from me
But I made a promise of you that
I used to used to make me complete
cos now I
[x2]
Pick up the pieces of my heart 
Girl every moment we're apart
The pain endless
I keep mend this
Broken broken broken broken heart
