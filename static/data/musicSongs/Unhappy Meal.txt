Lyrics:


(Hey kids are you tired of eating fruits and vegetables?
Are you sick of taking your vitamins?
Fed up with brushing your teeth night after night?
Then tell your parents to take you down to Molly McDolly's burger shack
Home of the original unhappy meal
If you aren't satisfied with your meal
Remember what Molly McDolly says
"You'll keep coming back for more")

You'll do anything I say when I talk, you believe it
Feed you bullshit all day
'Cause I know you will eat it
You see me on your television screen
You say my name so proudly
I could be the girl of your dreams
So tell your parents about me

Are you happy now?
Do you like being ignored? (ignored)
I make you unhappy now
But you keep coming back for more (for more)
Eat your heart out
Throw it up on the floor (floor)
Are you happy now?
Are you happy with your unhappy meal?
Are you happy with your unhappy, unhappy, unhappy meal?
Are you happy with your unhappy, unhappy, unhappy meal?

You wait at my window
Think you're so special
One milkshake then you have to go
"I've got a busy schedule"
Don't call me with your little bellyache
I won't satisfy your hunger
I don't remember your name
You're a ticket with a number

Are you happy now?
Do you like being ignored? (ignored)
I make you unhappy now
But you keep coming back for more (for more)
Eat your heart out
Throw it up all on the floor (floor)
Are you happy now?
Are you happy with your unhappy meal?
Unhappy, unhappy, unhappy Meal
Are you happy with your unhappy, unhappy, unhappy meal?
Are you happy, unhappy, unhappy with your unhappy meal?
Are you happy with your unhappy, unhappy, unhappy meal?

What I want, what I want
I can do anything I want as long as there's toy in a box
As long as there's a toy in a box (in a box)
What I want, what I want
I can do anything I want as long as there's a toy in a box
As long as there's a toy in a box (in a box)
What I want, what I want
I can do anything I want as long as there's a toy in a box
As long as there's a toy in a box (in a box)
