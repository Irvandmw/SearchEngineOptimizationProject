Lyrics:


I fell in love
Once too often
She was the nail
In my coffin

Light me up like a flame
And put me out once again

When you lost your dignity
You can rip mine right out of me
You lift your life with tongue and cheek
And I lift mine afraid to speak

And I'm tired enough to break into
And I'm certain that the only reason is you
And with you the issue is if I rolled out a list
And set it out and read it out loud
Never be kissed again

I made my bed
And she lay in it first
She's like a rose
With her head trapped in the dirt

Cut me up
Get me in the mood
And put me back together
Like a Rubik's cube

And there's no love between these sheets
Just (brought these knots[?]) with itchy feet
And when you dig your claws in deep
My heart will break but I wont bleed

And I'm tired enough to break into
And I'm certain that the only reason is you
And with you the issue is if I rolled out a list...
