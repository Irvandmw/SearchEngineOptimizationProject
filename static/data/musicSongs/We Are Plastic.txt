Lyrics:


We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

Here we go 'round on the boulevard
Top cuttin' that cake 'til the sugar flow stop (No, it don't stop)
Don't stop! (It's awkward)
Drip, drip, drip, baby, watch me melt
T-take a sip, sip, sip, but it doesn't help me stop (No, it don't stop)
Can't stop! (It's awkward)

Don't tell me you love me, in the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me, in the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic, and my heart's in the blender
Yeah, baby, we're plastic, and we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer

We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

Wire that girl for the electronic underground scene where the beat is chronic, yeah
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Oh yeah!
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Drip, drip, drip, baby, watch me melt
T-take a sip, sip, sip, but it doesn't help, it's bad (No, it don't stop)
So bad! (It's awkward)

Don't tell me you love me, in the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me, in the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic, and my heart's in the blender
Yeah, baby, we're plastic, and we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer

We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

We got a synthetic situation, and we dance with no intermission
Mister shouldn't've kissed her, before the rock show was oh-ah-over
Here we go-go, sir
We're making time, it's a record, record, record
(Sighhh, sigh, sigh, sigh)

Don't tell me you love me, in the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me, in the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic, and my heart's in the blender
Yeah, baby, we're plastic, and we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer

Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(S-sigh)
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
