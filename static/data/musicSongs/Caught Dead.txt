Lyrics:


I've got passion and a reason,
And I won't neglect my emotions,
Because I wanna spill, spill my guts,
But I don't want to pick them up,
I've got passion, and a reason,
And I won't neglect my emotions,
I'm excited and I'm exploding,
I'm ignited and I'm ready to go off

Rather be caught dead than weak

Cause I'd rather be caught dead, than be weak,
And in my last days I'll still be standing strong,
Cause I'd rather be caught dead, than be weak,
And in my last days I'll still be standing strong,

I wanna spill, spill my guts,
But I don't want to pick them up,
I've got too much pride and desire,
To let this go, I'll walk through fire

I've got passion, and a reason,
And I won't neglect my emotions 

Rather be caught dead than weak 

[Chorus:]

I'd rather be caught dead than weak,
Rather be caught dead than weak,

[Chorus:]
