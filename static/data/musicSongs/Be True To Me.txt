Lyrics:


Well if I'm a fool for loving you
And I guess I've a right to be
'Cause you told me when you fell in love
That you'd fall in love with me
And since that time I'm convinced that I'm
The one who's meant for you
So be true, be true, be true, be true to me

My friends all say that I'm just a fool
To sit home all alone
And to be content with a few love words
I hear on the telephone
But oh so precious are those tender words
I hear from you, that you'll
Be true, be true, be true, be true to me

I'll wait and watch the days go by
Until we come of age
And to our precious book of love
We'll add another page
A page that says these two will walk
Together all life through, that you'll
Be true, be true, be true, be true to me
