Lyrics:


It's only sane to be insane
Psychotic builds a castle and neurotic lives in it
I don't know what to do with my sanity
When the world's at the verge of calamity

O' sanity
O' sanity
What am I to do with you
Drink up, shoot up, anything you please
But you're always standing behind me like a devil in hell

O' sanity
Sanity
Why don't you let me go
Let go, let go, cut it out!
