Lyrics:


Oh it's another Rainy Day,
Another excuse for me to hide away,
Fog on the window I write your name,
Oh it's another Rainy day.

Outside a cloud is forming,
In my heart the rain is pouring down, Endlessly
The Sky is Gray Just like me,Just like me.

Oh it's another Rainy Day
The sun isn't out to scare the Dark away
Step outside to try to wash you away,
Oh it's another rainy day,

Outside a cloud is forming,
In my heart the rain is pouring down, Endlessly
The Sky is Gray Just like me,
All my Tears Flood the streets,
The sky is gray just like me, Just like me.

Well it's cold and it's gloomy,
What are you doing to me?
is the storm ever breaking
If Only you could make it stop raining

Outside a cloud is forming,
In my heart the rain is pouring down, Endlessly
The Sky is Gray Just like me
All my tears flood the streets
the sky is gray just like me, Just like me.
Oh it's another rainy day, Just like me.
Just like oh it's another rainy day...
