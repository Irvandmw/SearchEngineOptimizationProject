Lyrics:


We know it's hard for you to see
That this is all we want to be
A constant urge within us grows
We know it
To do the thing that we propose
We know it
We tried so hard to make the grade
Yes we know it
By making music day to day
Yes we know it
Although our task is never done
You know we know it
You ought to know it's just begun
You know we know it
And now it's time for us to say
But most of all we like to play
A song or two that makes you feel
We know it
Like all the good in you is real
We know it
Together now we've lots to hear
Yes we know it
To warm my heart to shed a tear
Yes we know it
So come and listen if you choose
You know we know it
And feel a joy you'll never lose
You know we know it
So everybody listen
Yeah
Everybody please give a listen
