Lyrics:


If our lips should meet in Innamorata
Kiss me, kiss me sweet in Innamorata
Hold me close and say you're mine
With a love that's warm as wine

I'm at heaven's door in Innamorata
Want you more and more in Innamorata
You're a symphony, the very beautiful sonata my Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my love

You're a symphony, the very beautiful sonata my Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my one and only sweetheart
Say you're my sweetheart, my love
