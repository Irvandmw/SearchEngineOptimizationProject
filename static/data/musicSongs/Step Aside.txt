Lyrics:


Every time I start to leave
You step right in front of me
He keeps screaming like I'm twenty miles away
Now you've been talking pretty rough
And I think I've heard enough
So step aside you're standing in my way

Step aside you're standing in my way
You might as well quit talking, I can't hear a word you say
Step aside and let me through
Or I might walk right over you
Step aside you're standing in my way

You have made it plain to see
What you really think of me
I don't wanna hear another word you say
Cause if I listen anymore
You might be talking from the floor
So step aside you're standing in my way

Step aside you're standing in my way, yeah
You might as well quit talking, I won't hear a word you say
Step aside and let me through
Or I might stomp all over you
Step aside you're standing in my way

Yeah, step aside you're standing in my way
