Lyrics:


I noticed you noticed you
walking through the door yeah
The sexiest finest thing
dancing on the floor yeah
You move you body like
Ive never seen before yeah
You make me wish
That i didnt have a girlfriend
Its crazy so crazy the way
your body shakin
I almost feel guilty picturing you get naked
'Cause baby baby baby
You know how to work it
You make me wish
That i didnt have a girlfriend

I love my girl i love my girl but come on
your hotter than an oven turned on
The things i wanna do with you are so wrong
wish i could stay but i should go home

Dance with me
Do you wanna dance with me girl
Just for a little while
Dance with me
Don't you wanna dance with me girl

[Chorus]

My Baby's good to me
But you'r just too fine
Ive been obsessin' 'bout ya all night
Your not a two or a three
Your one plus a nine
Your not just burning up your on fire

Dance with me
Do you wanna dance with me girl
Just for a little while
Dance with me
Don't you wanna dance with me girl

[Chorus]

Wish wish you make me wish
that i didnt have a girlfriend
wish wish you make me
You make me wish even though
I love my girlfriend
Wish wish
Hey hey
You make me you make me Yeah
You make me you make me Come on

[Chorus]
