Lyrics:


I don't care about my car
(Why'd it have to break down today?)
This old beat-up guitar
(Always out of tune anyway)
Well I'm down a pair of shoes
(And I swear it's not blues)
The only thing I couldn't stand to lose
Is you

I get screwed up, I get held down
But I still love having you around
I get screwed up, I get held down
But I still love having you around
Oh oh oh

I don't need new clothes
(You like the way I dress)
High-tech stereos
(Who am I trying to impress?)
No penthouse views
(Ground floor will do)
The only thing I need to get me through
Is you

I get screwed up, I get held down
But I still love having you around
I get screwed up, I get held down
But I still love having you around
Oh oh oh

With you I make it through the problems in my life
Without you I get screwed up every night

Yeah the only thing I couldn't stand to lose
Is you

I get screwed up, I get held down
But I still love having you around
I get screwed up, I get held down
But I still love having you around

I get screwed up, I get held down
But I still love having you around
I get screwed up, I get held down
But I still love having you around
Oh oh oh

I get screwed
