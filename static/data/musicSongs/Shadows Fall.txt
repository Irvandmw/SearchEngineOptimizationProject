Lyrics:


Shadows fall on our lives
So quickly, my friend
We feel warmth and see light
Then darkness descends

Shadows fall without warning
And we stumble around
Shadows fall without pity
And there's no peace to be found

Shadows fall on our lives
So slowly, my friend
We see them coming for miles
But our happiness we don't defend

Shadows fall where we let them
As neglect turns to regret 
Shadows fall, do you never get them?
Ah, you haven't lived long enough yet.

Shadows fall on our loved ones
When we are not to blame
And we can't see any reason
Why they're carrying all that pain

Shadows fall right on them
While there's light to their left and to their right
So we try to help them step over
But all they see is darkest night

Shadows fall without warning
And we stumble around
Shadows fall without pity
And there's no peace to be found
