Lyrics:


Lights on, stage set.
I guess I gotta put on a show again
'cause everyone's waiting
Females, fly jets
When I turn the radio on
I hear all my songs play (yeah)
Whatever money can buy
I've probably got it (that's real talk, yeah)
I see my name in the sky all over the world
And I just sit here saying

Lucky me.
I've gotta pose for the cameras
Even when my world's falling down
I still wear a smile
Lucky me
Even though I'm so damaged
Gotta pick myself up
And perform for the crowd
Lucky me
Pray none of my loved ones wannabe stars
'Cause nobody said it'd be so hard
Wouldn't put this on no one else (yeah)
Lucky me.

So exclusive
I don't have to wait in a line
It's like the club is mine now
If it was only that simple
Then wouldn't say it's easy to do
(easy to do)
And we know, that's not true
(that is not true)
Whatever money can buy
I've probably got it (that's real talk, yeah)
I see my name in the sky all over the world
And I just sit here saying

Lucky me.
I've gotta pose for the cameras
Even when my world's falling down
I still wear a smile
Lucky me
Even though I'm so damaged
Gotta pick myself up
And perform for the crowd
Lucky me
Pray none of my loved ones wannabe stars
Lucky me.
'Cause nobody said it'd be so hard
Lucky me.
Wouldn't put this on no one else (yeah)
Lucky me.

My dream and it's my heart
The life of being a star
You don't even know how hard it is, do you (yeah)
Now I'm thankful for everything
And I'm finally becoming a man
Now I gotta bigger show to do

Lucky me.
I've gotta pose for the cameras
Even when my worlds falling down
I still wear a smile
Lucky me
Even though I'm so damaged
Gotta pick myself up
And perform for the crowd
Lucky me
Pray none of my loved ones wannabe stars
Lucky me
'Cause nobody said it'd be so hard?
Lucky me
I wouldn't put this on no one else.
Lucky me
