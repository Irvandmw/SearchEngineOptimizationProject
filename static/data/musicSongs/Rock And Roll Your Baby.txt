Lyrics:


She has a way of walking
That says she knows it all
She has a way of talking
Makes you wanna tumble and fall
He wants to be her lover
He's gonna wait his turn
He has a cool man's cover
Even though he starting to burn

He's taking it slow and easy
Taking it slow and easy
Taking it slow, not letting it show
But he's gonna take it

He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
All night long

He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
All night long

He thinks he understands her
But then he may be wrong
'Cause if he ever lands her
He knows he's gonna have to be strong
He's gonna take it slow
He wants to make it last
He knows she's gonna go
If he starts moving too fast

He's taking it slow and easy
Taking it slow and easy
Taking it slow, not letting it show
But he's gonna take it

He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
All night long

He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
All night long

She has a way of walking
That says she knows it all
She has a way of talking
Makes you wanna tumble and fall
He wants to be her lover
He's gonna wait his turn
He has a cool man's cover
Even though he's starting to burn

He's taking it slow and easy
Taking it slow and easy
Taking it slow, not letting it show
But he's gonna take it

He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
All night long

He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
All night long

He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
He's gonna rock and roll his baby
All night long
