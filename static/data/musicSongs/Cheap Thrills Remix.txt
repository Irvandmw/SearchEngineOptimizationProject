Lyrics:


(Up with it girl)
(Rock with it girl)
(Show dem it girl)

(Bounce with it girl)
(Dance with it girl)
(Get with it girl)

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and it won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's Friday night and it won't be long

'Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you baby (jus u an me)

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money (u worth more dan diamond more dan gold)
As long as I can feel the beat (mek di beat jus tek control)
I don't need no money (u worth more dan diamond more dan gold)
As long as I keep dancing (free up urself get outa control)

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and it won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and it won't be long

'Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need (Sia)
No I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you baby (jus u an me)

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money (u worth more dan diamond more dan gold)
As long as I can feel the beat (mek di beat jus tek control)
I don't need no money (u worth more dan diamond more dan gold)
As long as I keep dancing (free up urself get outa control)

(Me an u girl)
(U an me)
(Drop it 2 di floor an mek mi see your energy because)
(Mi nah play no hide an seek)
(Wah fi see di ting u have weh mek mi feel weak girl)
('cause anytime u wine an kotch it di selector pull it up an put it pon repeat girl)
(I'm nah touch a dollar in mi pocket)
('cause nuttin in this world ain't more dan what u worth)

I don't need no money (u worth more dan diamond more dan gold)
As long as I can feel the beat (mek di beat jus tek control)
I don't need no money (u worth more dan diamond more dan gold)
As long as I keep dancing (free up urself get outa control)

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money (u worth more dan diamond more dan gold)
As long as I can feel the beat (mek di beat jus tek control)
I don't need no money (u worth more dan diamond more dan gold)
As long as I keep dancing (free up urself get outa control)
