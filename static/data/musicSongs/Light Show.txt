I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we undivided

And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)
I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (What you got? Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we undivided (Ayo)

And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)

So much gold wrapped 'round my neck, I look like Mr. T (Ayy)
I say this with all due respect, you not fuckin' with me (No)
I need somebody to help me, I'm havin' a problem (Hey)
Like should I just put on my gold, or should I wear the diamonds? (Diam')
When I pull up on them hoes, I got all of 'em smilin' (Skrrt)
Run up that check with my bros and then we gon' divide it (Break)
I promise that I'll never fold, 'cause a young nigga solid
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
And wherever a young nigga go, I'ma always be shinin' (Hey)

I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we undivided
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)
I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (What you got? Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we undivided (Ayo)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)

I'ma make niggas respect it, ayoung nigga be on the grind
(Be on the grind)
She saw them real VVSs and young nigga be on her mind
(On her mind, yeah)
Hold lot of ice on my body, be careful, don't slip on the water (Water)
Lookin' like I'm from Miami, they think a young nigga from Florida (Yeah)
Only young nigga in Charlotte, that's rockin' a whole lot of diamonds (Diam')
You'd make yourself mighty too if your Cuban link cost $20, 000 (Racks)
Got the same jewelry as Future, this chain was made by Avianne (Yeah)
Whole lot of niggas was sleepin', I had to get up and remind 'em that

I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we undivided
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin'
I got a, I got a, I got a whole lot of diamonds (What you got? Yeah)
Whole lot of gold on my neck, so a young nigga shinin' (Shine)
Add up the check with my niggas and we undivided (Ayo)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'ma make niggas respect it, a young nigga grindin' (Hey)
