Lyrics:


You will never know what's behind my skull
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

You will never know what's under my hair
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

You will never know what's under my skin
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

You will never know what is in my veins
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

Won't you go to someone else's dreams?
Won't you go to someone else's head?
Haven't you taken enough from me?
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

And you will never know what I'm thinking of
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

And you will never understand what I believe
So won't you say goodnight, so I can say goodbye

Haven't you taken enough from me?
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

Won't you go to someone else's dreams?
Won't you go to someone else's head?
Haven't you taken enough from me?
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

I start to part
Two halves of my heart
In the dark and I
Don't know
Where I should go
And the tears
And the fears
Begin to multiply

Taking time in a simple place
In my bed
Where my head
Rests on a pillowcase
And it's said
That a war's led
But I forget
That I let another day go by

I wanna be afraid but it seems
That these days I'm caught under water
And I'm falling farther
My heart's getting harder,
I'm calling my father
Am I screaming to an empty sky?

Empty sky, no way, that's me
'Cause one half of my heart is free
Empty sky, no way, that's me,
'Cause the other half of my heart's asleep
