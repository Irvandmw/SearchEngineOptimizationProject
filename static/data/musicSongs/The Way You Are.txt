Lyrics:


I see the way he tries to break you down
And tries to keep you insecure bout your hair, bout your dress
And all that babe
I wanna take you away
Cos what I see is so true and girl that defines you
You gotta believe in me, it don't even matter what he says
I think my heart knows you're the babe

[Chorus]
But it ain't my place to say what you should do
And I can't let you stop being you
Cos I know you babe like he don't know you babe
Wish we were closer babe
Cos I would never

See I'll never try to change you into something you're not
Just like the man in your life who don't know what he got
I like the way you are, the way you are
I like the way you are, the way you are,
If I ever saw you change then my whole world would stop
I wanna go back in time so I can change every clock
I like the way you are, the way you are
I like the way you are, the way you are

Physical attraction meets my satisfaction
Every bit I see about you pleases me
I want to say there's no need to stay
Don't misunderstand me I know it ain't easy
To let go of what you always really felt was meant to be
But girl listen to me

[Chorus]
It ain't my place to say what you should do
But I can't stand how he keeps hurting you
He don't love you babe like I love you babe
So lets get closer babe
Cos I would never

See I'll never try to change you into something you're not
Just like the man in your life who don't know what he got
I like the way you are, the way you are
I like the way you are, the way you are,
If I ever saw you change then my whole world would stop
I wanna go back in time so I can change every clock
I like the way you are, the way you are
I like the way you are, the way you are

He don't seem to give you the love that you need
And I know what you need is to love you the way you are
Just break it girl, just just walk away
You need to realize that I could be your guy
And he don't seem to know what he's got in his hands
Don't appreciate you not the way that I know I can, I can
So take me and you'll understand

See I'll never try to change you into something you're not
Just like the man in your life who don't know what he got
I like the way you are, the way you are
I like the way you are, the way you are,
If I ever saw you change then my whole world would stop
I wanna go back in time so I can change every clock
I like the way you are, the way you are
I like the way you are, the way you are

Ohhhhhhhhhh ... yeah

If I ever saw you change then my whole world would stop
I wanna go back in time so I can change every clock
I like the way you are, the way you are
I like the way you are, the way you are
