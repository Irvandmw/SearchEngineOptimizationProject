Lyrics:


[Hook:]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You canât get nothinâ from me
You was talkinâ shit, now Iâm somebody you would love to be
Iâma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillinâ, Iâma smile back, smile back
(Just tell 'em Mac)

[Verse 1:]
Call your army, bring your tanks, Iâm a big boy with a big boy bank
Self-employed, independent, once you start, donât take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet itâs gonâ take a second
But once I start up my engine Iâm gone, too fast to catch him
Iâm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What Iâm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
Sweeter than creme brulee, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, who the shit, cooler than what coolest is
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it
Stupid bitch, keep on hatinâ, Iâma keep on doinâ it
Spend a day as me, boy you couldnât get the shoes to fit

[Hook x2:]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You canât get nothinâ from me
You was talkinâ shit, now Iâm somebody you would love to be
Iâma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillinâ, Iâma smile back, smile back

[Verse 2:]
Used to tell me I was fake, they would hate, now they on my dick
Most Dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate
Rollie on my wrist, I ainât rich, but Iâm still coppinâ shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokinâ, drinkinâ yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess thatâs just a fact
Iâma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so thereâs no time to stall
Iâma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still with my boys I straight up grew with

[Hook x2:]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You canât get nothinâ from me
You was talkinâ shit, now Iâm somebody you would love to be
Iâma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillinâ, Iâma smile back, smile back
