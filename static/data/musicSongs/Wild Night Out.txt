Lyrics:


'69 Mustang
Cutting in the fast lane
Headed for some malibu night shine
Blastin' out some gansta rap
You can laugh but that's my jam
I wish I could fly off the 405

Didn't even prep my shoes
All I want is to get loose
Don't we all just looking for fun?
Everybody's meeting there
Throw your troubles in the air
Might even find someone to love

Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll keep going till we all fall down
Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll be dancing till the fire burns out
And we all never break
Might as well misbehave
Rather wave while the world spins around
Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll keep going till we all fall down

Oh na na na na na
Oh na na na na na

Almost spilled the
Get into a hide away
I can feel the thrill in my veins
Breathing in the salty air
Come and meet me if you dare
Say anything you want 'em to say

Got my jeans on super tight
Up for anything at night
Aren't we all just looking for fun?
Got my lucky
Everything is looking up
Might even find someone to love

Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll keep going till we all fall down
Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll be dancing till the fire burns out
And we all never break
Might as well misbehave
Rather wave while the world spins around
Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll keep going till we all fall down

Oh na na na na na
Oh na na na na na
Oh na na na na na
We'll keep going till we all fall down
Oh na na na na na
Oh na na na na na
Oh na na na na na
We'll keep going till we all fall down

And we all never break
Might as well misbehave
Rather wave while the world spins around
Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll keep going till we all fall down

Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll keep going till we all fall down
Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll be dancing till the fire burns out
And we all never break
Might as well misbehave
Rather wave while the world spins around
Oh, it's a wild night out
We'll keep going till we all fall down

Oh na na na na na
Oh na na na na na
Oh na na na na na
We'll keep going till we all fall down
We'll keep going till we all fall down
