Lyrics:


Well, I'm a hard-working boy
'Cause my mama didn't raise no fools
She told me go out and get a job, yeah
As soon as I got out of school
She told me how to catch an older woman
Before she told me 'bout the birds and bees
She said, baby, oh, money don't grow on
Money don't, money don't, money don't grow on trees

Money don't, money don't grow on trees, yeah (grow on trees)
Yeah, darling
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (grow on trees)

Well, I'm a hard-working boy
It's the only way to stay alive
You can't get anywhere daydreaming (daydreaming)
So you better get a 9 to 5
Unless you can dance like Fred Astaire
You better think about a college degree
'Cause baby, baby, money don't (money don't)
Money don't, money don't, money don't grow on trees

Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Ah, listen to me now, yeah
Money don't, money don't grow on trees, yeah (don't grow on trees)

Listen to me now

We do what we do (we do what we do)
My mama didn't raise no fool (mama didn't raise no fool)
You can't dance like Fred Astaire (dance like Fred Astaire)
Better get on the street
Everybody up, get up and move your feet, yeah

Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Ah, listen to me now
Money don't, money don't grow on trees, yeah (don't grow on trees)

Oh, break it down one time

I need my money (he needs his money)
Like a hog needs slop (What you say, brother?)
Baby, baby, I need my money
Don't, wanna stop, oh, no
Making money, money, money, money, money, money
Hey, yeah, ooh
Money, money, money, money, money, money, oh

You can't do it like Fred Astaire
Best think about a college degree
Look, baby (baby), honey (honey)
Money (money), money (money)
Money don't grow on trees

Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Don't ya know, money
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
No, oh, said money
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Baby, no
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Yeah
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)

Money don't, yeah
