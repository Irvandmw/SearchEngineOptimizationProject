Lyrics:


Red handed love
There is smoke and fire
You are the greatest liar
I wish you'd disappear
Now I've seen enough
Of your dirty love
Yes, I have seen enough
Of your dirty love

Now I got you out, I just want you gone
I need to be alone
You're dirty magic, you broke in my heart
With your black heart

Now the power's out, and you are thin air
What an illusion, I could have sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors
You are just a hollow man, hologram
[x2]

And I fear you'll be back, inside all the cracks
No, I can't handle that
History's heartbreak, was in my mind
Now I no longer cry
I no longer cry
Cry
I'll no longer cry

Now I got you out, I just want you gone
I need to be alone
You're dirty magic, you broke in my heart
With your black heart

Now the power's out, and you are thin air
What an illusion, I could have sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors
You are just a hollow man, hologram
[x2]

But now the power's up, and you are thin air
What an illusion, I could have sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors
You are just a hollow man, hologram
