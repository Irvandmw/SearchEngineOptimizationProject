Lyrics:


I wont lie
I always try to do my best
Yeah I've try
And then the help with the rest
It's a crime
If you don't give it you wrong
When you do
Start to feel you want it all

I'm telling you that you can do
Anything you want to and
Put your silly feelings inside
Let go for just one night

I don't care if your ready or not
But just keep it moving
And prove it tonight
Imma do my best
But cupid got the rest
And I know I know
That love is gonna get you tonight

I can't say
That your ready for this
Arrows flying
And cupid never will miss
Do you see
That your falling hard for me
Cause I know
It's time for you to let it go

I'm telling you that you should do
Anything you want to and
Put your silly feelings inside
Let go for just one night
Well

I don't care if your ready or not
But just keep it moving
And prove it tonight
Imma do my best
And cupid got the rest
And I know I know
That love is gonna get you tonight

I know for me
That my life is changing
(you've got to follow me)
I won't stand here
And care what they're saying
Cause cupid fell me in love

So get yourself together
Don't give up
Cupid gonna get yah
No matter what
Taken all the love
And love into
Focus on yourself
Boy whatever you do

I say ooh
Telling you that you can
Anything you want to do
Put your silly feelings inside
Let go for just one night

I don't care if you're ready or not
Just keep keep it moving
And prove it tonight
Imma do my best
But cupid got the rest
And I know I know I know
That I don't care if you're ready or not
But just keep it moving
And prove it tonight
Imma do my best
But cupid got the rest
And I know I know
That love is gonna get you tonight
