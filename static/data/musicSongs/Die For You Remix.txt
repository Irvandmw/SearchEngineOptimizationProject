Lyrics:


[The Weeknd:]
I'm findinâ ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through
I just canât say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
Youâre scared to be lonely
âSpecially in the night
I'm scared that Iâll miss you
Happens every time
I don't want this feelin'
I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ainât workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah

[SZA:]
I'm finding time to catch a wave
Hop in the car with you
Hoping to find the time to feel good
Wanna fight less, wanna build more
Wanna be your type, change your world
Show you love, be the only girl
Who got you tripping and moving like you don't know me
I put the bitch in position,she really owe me
Will you call me when I'm on your mind
Baby can you

[The Weeknd:]
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah

I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah babe
(Die for you)
