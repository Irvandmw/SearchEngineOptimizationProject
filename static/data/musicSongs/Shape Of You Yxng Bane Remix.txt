Lyrics:


You know me love when you get nasty
I wanna do you in the backseat
Never put no one above me
Seven days sex, I'ma leave you so weak
Now hol' up, hol' up
And we'll go slower, slower
Tell the chauffeur, chauffeur
Keep your hands up on the road 'cause, the road 'cause
So I can't when you doing the work, love how you whine too
Neck back, gripping your hair, working your spine too
Gentleman, I let you come first and then I come through
Nine lives killed the whole night, nigga ate you

Rude bwoy mi nuh beg for it
Big black hand ting ita end it (bop, bop, bop)
These niggas all pussies baby
I'm the only nigga to drive that pussy crazy
'Cause I love the shape of you mama
I wanna put my hands on ya
She know I'm tryna open her
Body like a bottle Coca Cola
'Cause I love the shape of you mama
I wanna put my hands on ya
She know I'm tryna open her
Body like a bottle Coca Cola

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

She said me talking too much, me talking too much
I should come her way, she said me want it too much, me want it too much
(That's a likkle baby one)
Come grab on it, don't get offended
There's enough for you girl and your best friend
Me know you want this, stop pretending
In the back of the rave or in a basement
Any place that you name girl we can go
If you're feeling my vibe
We can disappear to a place that's out of sight
Just you and I-I-I and we'll be fi-I-ine
Just you and I-I-I and we'll be fi-I-ine, fi-I-ine

Rude gyal mi nuh beg friend
Big black hand ting ita end it (Bop, bop, bop)
These niggas all pussies baby
I'm the only nigga to drive that pussy crazy
'Cause I love the shape of you mama
I wanna put my hands on ya
She know I'm tryna open her
Body like a bottle Coca Cola
'Cause I love the shape of you mama
I wanna put my hands on ya
She know I'm tryna open her
Body like a bottle Coca Cola

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

You know me love when you get nasty
I wanna do you in the backseat
Never put no one above me
Seven days sex, I'ma leave you so weak
You know me love when you get nasty
I wanna do you in the backseat
Never put no one above me
Seven days sex, I'ma leave you so weak now
