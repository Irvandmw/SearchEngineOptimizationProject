Lyrics:


May the good Lord bless an' keep you, 
Whether near or far away. 
May you find that long awaited, 
Golden day today . . . 

May your troubles all be small ones, 
And your fortune ten times ten, 
May the good lord bless and keep you, 
'Till we meet again . . . 

May you walk with the sunlight shining, 
An' a blue bird in every tree. 
May there be silver lining, 
Back of every cloud you see . . . 

Fill your dreams with sweet tomorrows, 
Never mind what might have been. 
May the good Lord bless an' keep you, 
'Till we meet again . . . 

May the good Lord bless an' keep you, 
'Till we meet again . . .
