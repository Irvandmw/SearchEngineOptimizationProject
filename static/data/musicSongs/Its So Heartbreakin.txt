Lyrics:


Itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
When somebody youâve been dreaming of
Is in love with somebody else
You canât keep on smiling over rainyâs due
Keep on walking though youâve gotta hold in your shoe
But itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else

John thought Jennie really love him true
Till he caught her kissing with Bill
John is so lonesome, donât know what heâll do
Since Jane went over the hills
So there goes Johnnie with a broken heart
He is just too good for nothing since theyâre apart
Cause itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else

Oh, itâs so heartbreaking when youâre love is gone
And your dream love go up in smoke
And itâs so frightening, baby, when you love someone
And he thinks your love is a joke
Oh, you gotta keep on living till the day you die
But youâre so disgusted that you wonder why
Cause itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else

I said that itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
It hurts so bad, yes it does
So heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
That man really turn just back on
So heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
