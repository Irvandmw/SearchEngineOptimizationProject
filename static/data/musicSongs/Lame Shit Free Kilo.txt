Lyrics:


Aye, free my nigga Ki out the cages (Free that nigga)
Nigga you so broke I'm making payments (Broke bitch)
Never pay for pussy you a lame bitch (Lame nigga)
Me, my niggas never on that lame shit
Gang shit (Gang), pull up and we fuckin' bang bitch
Say shit (Ooh), out your neck then that's a case quick
Claim it (Bitch), if you claim you'll sense some fake shit
Stay stitched, bossed up then I lane switch
(Skrrt, skrrt)
Aye, free my nigga Ki out the cages (Free that nigga)
Nigga you so broke I'm making payments (Broke bitch)
Never pay for pussy you a lame bitch (Lame nigga)
Me, my niggas never on that lame shit
Gang shit (Gang), pull up and we fuckin' bang bitch
Say shit (Ooh), out your neck then that's a case quick
Claim it (Bitch), if you claim you'll sense some fake shit
Stay stitched, bossed up then I lane switch
(Skrrt, skrrt)

Pull up, I was flexin' out that coupe, bitch
Lookin' back, I'm askin' what it do, bitch
Since a youngin' I was always on that money shit
Now I'm ballin' and these niggas on that funny shit
Money quick, acting dumb now that's some dummy shit
New stick, I just copped another 30 clip
Move bitch, I'm getting tired of your funny shit
Muddy kicks, 'cause I'm fresh out of the jungle bitch
Talkin' out your neck you gon' get slapped out
She was on my dick when she saw racks out
But she only hit my phone cause I'm up now
We smokin' big dope, a nigga checked out

Aye, free my nigga Ki out the cages (Free that nigga)
Nigga you so broke I'm making payments (Broke bitch)
Never pay for pussy you a lame bitch (Lame nigga)
Me, my niggas never on that lame shit
Gang shit (Gang), pull up and we fuckin' bang bitch
Say shit (Ooh), out your neck then that's a case quick
Claim it (Bitch), if you claim you'll sense some fake shit
Stay stitched, bossed up then I lane switch
(Skrrt, skrrt)
Aye, free my nigga Ki out the cages (Free that nigga)
Nigga you so broke I'm making payments (Broke bitch)
Never pay for pussy you a lame bitch (Lame nigga)
Me, my niggas never on that lame shit
Gang shit (Gang), pull up and we fuckin' bang bitch
Say shit (Ooh), out your neck then that's a case quick
Claim it (Bitch), if you claim you'll sense some fake shit
Stay stitched, bossed up then I lane switch
(Skrrt, skrrt)

Stuck that nigga up then I'm skippin' state to state
Roll my money up then I'm skirting in the Wraith
Yeah, yeah
Glock in your motherfucking face
Spray it like some motherfucking mace
I'd of been around some killers push a lot of fucking weight
I'd been up with some niggas I don't think they just gon' spray
And you talkin' like you own the streets, my folks that's where we stay
And they never heard of you, so you can't be from 'round the the way bitch
We only fuck with real niggas (Yeah)
You know we in the field nigga (Yeah)
I was thirteen, I learned to deal nigga (Yeah)
And we never play around, we really drill niggas (drill niggas)

Aye, free my nigga Ki out the cages (Free that nigga)
Nigga you so broke I'm making payments (Broke bitch)
Never pay for pussy you a lame bitch (Lame nigga)
Me, my niggas never on that lame shit
Gang shit (Gang), pull up and we fuckin' bang bitch
Say shit (Ooh), out your neck then that's a case quick
Claim it (Bitch), if you claim you'll sense some fake shit
Stay stitched, bossed up then I lane switch
(Skrrt, skrrt)
