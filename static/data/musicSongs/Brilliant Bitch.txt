Lyrics:


Don't let me waiting' all night
I been waitin' all night, yeah

Ah shit, get it, go get it
When them bars come, she gon want a yopper
Baby so authentic
Too real she can never win a Oscar
Fuck a bag by a pillar, baby let it pile up to the ceilin'
Tell me, tell me that you need this, say it like you mean it
All I, all I, all I

All I ever wanted was a Brilliant Bitch
With a nice ass, with a wall street mind and a project smile
Girl what's your last name?
All I ever wanted was a Catholic Girl
Who can move that work, so you ain't never gotta ask me whens my time
I goddammit want a Brilliant Bitch

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ay
She ain't' bad till she got it like this
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ay
Goddamn alotta' Brilliant Bitch
Ass on 10, 10, 10, 10, 10 mind on, 10, 10, 10
That's that win, win, damn I love a Brilliant Bitch

Baby all about winnin'
2 Thrill, what a snore nigga feelin'
Gonna do it life sentence
Already know the loss that I'm feelin'
Sayin' lies till' you feel it
Only real nigga's know what the real is
Girl tell me what the deal is
All, all, all I

All I ever wanted was a Brilliant Bitch
With a nice ass, with a wall street mind and a project smile
Girl what's your last name?
All I ever wanted was a Catholic Girl
Who can move that work, so you ain't never gotta ask me whens my time
I goddammit want a Brilliant Bitch

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ay
She ain't' bad till so she got it like this
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ay
