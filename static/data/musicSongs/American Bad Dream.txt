Lyrics:


Remember when ninth grade was about getting laid
Skipping class tryin' not to get caught
Now you gotta take a test in a bullet proof vest
Scared to death that you might get shot

It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the devil's disguise
That hides behind the lies, that hides
The truth and I just can't take it no more

So wake me up
From this American bad dream
Is it this messed up?
Or is it really reality?
I'm becoming numb
To all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up
From this American bad dream
(This American bad dream)
From this American bad dream
(This American bad dream)

I remember going 10 over the limit would just get you a ticket
Just an inconvenience gettin' stopped
Bad cops played the jury made the good ones worry
About showing up and doing their job

It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the devil's disguise
That hides behind the lies, that hides
The truth and I just can't take it no more

So wake me up
From this American bad dream
Is it this messed up?
Or is it really reality?
I'm becoming numb
To all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up
From this American bad dream
(This American bad dream)
Yeah this American bad dream
From this American bad dream
Ooh

It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the devil's disguise
Damn

So wake me up
From this American bad dream
(This American bad dream)
Is it this messed up?
Or is it really reality?
(Is it really reality?)
I'm becoming numb
To all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up
From this American bad dream
(This American bad dream)
From this American bad dream
(This American bad dream)
Wake me up, wake me up
(This American bad dream)
Wake me up from this American bad dream
(This American bad dream)
From this American bad dream
