Lyrics:


Although we've never, never danced
I loved you with just one glance

You were dancing, I was glancing
As you passed me on the floor
You saw me glancing but you kept dancing
Out of the room and through the door

I beg your pardon but in the garden
He placed a flower in your hair
But when he kissed you, oh, how I missed you
Wishing that I were there

Then I dreamed upon a star
Wishing I was where you are
How I thought the day would never come

And when I thought that I was first
All at once my bubble burst
And I was standing where I started from

To my regret dear, we've never met dear
But I love you just the same
Although we've never danced
I loved you with just one glance
And I never, no I never knew your name

To my regret dear, we've never met dear
But I love you just the same
Although we've never danced
I loved you with just one glance
And I never, no I never knew your name
