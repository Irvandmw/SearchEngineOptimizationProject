Lyrics:


I count my time in dog years
Swimming in sevens
Slow dancing in seconds
Oh and I'm the one that loves you
Oh and I'm the one that loves you
I spend my time daydreaming
As sure as the sea
It's just you and me
Oh and I'm the one that loves you
Oh and I'm the one that loves you

And if you had a bad week
Just let me touch your cheek
Oh and I'll be there waiting
When you get frustrated
I know things are changing
But, darling, I'm saying
I'll be singing you in all of my songs

Come what may
I'll still stay
Inside your mind
For all of time
Singing, ooh
We will be alright
In the afterlife

Of all that is shifting
And shaking my system
I know your rhythm
I know, I know, I know
That I'm the one that loves you
Oh and I'm the one that loves you

And if you had a bad week
I will sing you to sleep
Oh and I'll be there waiting
If you start to get jaded
I know things are changing
But, darling, I'm saying
I've been here all along

Come what may
I'll still stay
Inside your mind
For all of time
Singing, ooh
We will be alright
Not in vein will still stay the same
Inside your mind
For all time
Singing, ooh
We will be alright
In the afterlife
In the afterlife

I count my time in dog years, dog years, dog years, dog years
We will be alright
We will be alright
In the afterlife
Singing, baby, we will be alright
We will be alright
We will be alright
