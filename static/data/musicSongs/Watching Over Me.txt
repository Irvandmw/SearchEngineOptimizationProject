Lyrics:


Don't lie to me 
I've seen everything I need 
And I've heard all the requests 
Like a symphony of thieves 

Don't cry for me 
I don't need your sympathy 
I've got everything I need 
Right here inside of me 

And I know it's not that simple 
But I think I'll get it right 
'Cause no one else is listening tonight 

I know you're out there 
And I know you care 
'Cause I feel you 
Like an angel watching over me 

Don't shut me out 
I'm an arson to myself 
Who can't put out the fires 
Until there's nothing left 

So take my broken glass 
And help me make a window 
So I can see your face 
After all that I have been through
