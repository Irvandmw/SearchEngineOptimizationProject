Lyrics:


I don't want to break this moment
I don't want to twist our fate
I don't want to simplify or complicate
I don't want to go down easy
Something about you makes me high
A little angel tells me don't let this one by
Don't be shy, testify

Let me love you from this moment
Let me dance a dream that far
Let me fall let me rise
Let me dance in your eyes
And show you who you are
Let me wrap myself around your secrets
Till the stars burn into blue
Let me kiss let me touch
Close your eyes and just
Let me love you

Girl, I want to be the reason
I want to be you alibi
I want to be the one
That holds you when you cry
I want to see the place inside you
Where no one else has ever been 
I want to know all your fears
And all your sins
So let me in.

Let me love you from this moment
Let me dance a dream that far
Let me fall let me rise
Let me dance in your eyes
And show you who you are
Let me wrap myself around your secrets
Till the stars burn into blue
Let me kiss let me touch
Close your eyes and just
Let me love you

Girl let me love you

Let me love you from this moment
Let me dance a dream that far
Let me fall let me rise
Let me dance in your eyes
And show you who you are
Let me wrap myself around your secrets
Till the stars burn into blue
Let me kiss let me touch
Close your eyes and just
Let me love you

Girl let me love you
