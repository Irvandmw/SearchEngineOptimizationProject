Lyrics:


All along the road of life I roam
Looking for a place to call my own
Not a fancy mansion
Or a bungalow for me
Everywhere I go I seem to find
Hangin' on the door that same old sign
My heart beats slower when I read on the door
No vacancy

No vacancy, no vacancy
All along the line, same old sign
Waitin' for me
No vacancy, no vacancy
My heart beats slower when I read on the door
No vacancy

Not so very long ago it seemed
Many a happy dream I dreamed
Of a little nest where I could rest
And the world was free
Now the mighty war is over and won
Trouble and trials just begun
I face that terrible enemy
No vacancy

No vacancy, no vacancy
All along the line, same old sign
Waitin' for me
No vacancy, no vacancy
My heart beats slower when I read on the door
No vacancy

Brother if you live a life of ease
You'd better take a moment on your knees
And thank the Lord above
For all he's done for you
Livin' in a world of grief and hate
Hopin' every day that the hand of fate
Will remove that sign on the door
No vacancy

No vacancy, no vacancy
All along the line, same old sign
Waitin' for me
No vacancy, no vacancy
My heart beats slower when I read on the door
No vacancy
