Lyrics:


What will the world be like when you're on your own?
What will the world be like when you're almost grown?
What will the world be like when you pack your things
And you leave your home?
What in the world will tomorrow bring?

Will you be safe in the sweet arms of love?
Will you be true to yourself and the things you believe?

What will the world be like when you need a friend?
What will the world be like when you're on the mend?
What will the world be like when you go astray
And you slip and fall?
How in the world will you find your way?

Will you find peace and forgiveness and joy?
Will you have children yourself, and be worried like me?

What will the world be like when you're on your own?
What will the world be like when you're almost grown?
What will the world be like when you pack your things
And you leave your home?
What in the world will tomorrow bring?

What will the world be like?
