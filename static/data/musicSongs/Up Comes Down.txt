Lyrics:


BREAK!

Well this goes out to everybody
Who came to swing when we rock this party
It don't matta if you're 14 or 40
What we gonna do is just get this started
It's the Krutch brothers gettin mad retarded
If ya don't like it then disregard it
Stay true to what we believe, we never parted,
And we still rockin' mics just like we started

[chorus]
When up comes down,
Shake it like an earthquake
Turn a-round
Nothing can stop you
When up comes down,
Shake it like an earthquake
Turn a-round
Nothing can stop you
NOW!

It stays on just like the stage we blaze on
Light it like napalm, Thousand Foot up in the maison
Holy terror prepare yourself for the storm
You know it's on when the Krutch drops the bomb, yo
We can get the show on,
Right here, no fear
Rockin the party on
From the floor to the chandelier
Check the word
Don't just settle for video,
Can I get a yo?
Shake it down for the millennium 

(when up comes down,
Shake it like an earthquake
Turn a-round, nothing can stop you)

When up comes down,
Shake it like an earthquake
Turn a-round,
Nothing can stop you

Nai...nai...nai...nothing can stop you now
Nai...nai...nai...nothing can stop you now

Burrbopbop!
