Lyrics:


One day
We flew across the sea
Then took a chance on love
Under a Christmas moon

And I...
Would do it again
I swear...
I'd do it all again

Let's have a dance
The season warm and bright
Remember all we love
And how it all began

Oh my...
But it would be a shame
If you never knew
I'd do it all again

Under a Christmas moon

For what it's worth
I never had a doubt
You opened up my heart
Another year gone by

Let's fly...
Let's do it all again
You and I
Let's do it all again

We'll fly
The season warm and bright
Under a Christmas moon
Let's do it all again
We'll do it all again
Yeah
Let's do it all again
Under a Christmas moon
The seasons warm and bright
Let's do it all again
Again, and again
And again
