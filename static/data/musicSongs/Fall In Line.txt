Lyrics:


[Christina Aguilera:]
Little girls
Listen closely
'Cause no one told me
But you deserve to know
That in this world
You are not beholden
You do not owe them
Your body and your soul

All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older, and
All the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her

[Christina Aguilera & Demi Lovato:]
It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line
No, I wasn't made to fall in line (no-ooh)

[Demi Lovato:]
Show some skin
Make him want you
Cus God forbid you
Know your own way home
Ask yourself
Why it matters
Who it flatters
You're more than flesh and bones

All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older, and
All the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her

[Christina Aguilera & Demi Lovato:]
It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength (my strength)
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this (pay, pay)
They're gonna burn me at the stake (stake)
But I got a fire in my veins (veins)
I wasn't made to fall in line (line)
No, no, I wasn't made to fall in line (No we weren't made to fall in line)

Yea, two, three
Right, two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March, two, three
Two, three
Who told you
You're allowed to think

Yea, two, three
Right, two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March, two, three
Two, three
Who told you
You're allowed to think

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line

I got a fire in my veins
I'm never gonna fall in line

Yea, two, three
Right, two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March, two, three
Two, three
Who told you
You're allowed to think

Yea, two, three
Right, two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March, two, three
Two, three
Who told you
You're allowed to think
