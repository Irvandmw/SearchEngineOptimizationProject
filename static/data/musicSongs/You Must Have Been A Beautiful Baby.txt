Lyrics:


You must have been a beautiful baby, 
you must have been a wonderful child... 
When you were only startin' 
to go to kindergarten  
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
you must have shown the other kids how... 
I can see the judge's eyes as they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow!  

Oh!, You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now... 

[instrumental]

Does your dad appreciate 
that you are merely great? 
Does your mother realize 
you're such a treat for the eyes?  

You must have been a beautiful baby, 
you must have been a wonderful child... 
When you were only startin' 
to go to kindergarten  
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
you must have shown the other kids how... 
I can see the judge's eyes as they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow!  

Oh!, You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now... (she's a cutie!) 
baby look at you now...
