Lyrics:


Tell ya 'bout Machine Gun Kelly
He road along the outlaw trails
Machine Gun Kelly was a simple man
But his woman was as hard as nails

Watch out Machine Gun
Don't let her run you round
Don't let a woman put you six feet in the ground
Machine Gun

Tell ya 'bout Kathryn Kelly
Tired about bein' small time now
Figured they'd kidnap a rich man's son
Make it in the world of crime

Watch out Machine Gun
Don't let her run you round
Don't let a woman put you six feet in the ground
Machine Gun

Better watch out Machine Gun Kelly
Careful of what'cha do now
If you keep listening to your old lady
No tellin' what will happen to you now
Machine Gun

The government boys who came for Machine Gun
Took the poor boy away
They stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth Prison
Where her lived til his dying day

Watch out Machine Gun
Don't let her run you down
Don't let a woman put you six feet in the ground
Machine Gun

Hey watch out Machine Gun Kelly
Careful of what'cha do now
If you keep listening to your old lady
Ain't no tellin' what'll happen to you now
Machine Gun

Watch out Machine Gun
