Lyrics:


Come and join me in a prayer, 
In a humble prayer for peace. 
One voice may be weak, 
But together we'll be heard . . . 

Let us gather âround and pray, 
For a life of peace and love, 
In a world that's free from want, 
And free from fear. 

Pray for the hearts of all mankind, 
That they may find, 
New faith and trust in each other, 
And peace of mind! 

Come and join me in a prayer, 
If we all kneel side by side, 
In a prayer for peace, 
How can we be denied? 

If we only pray for the hearts of all mankind, 
That they may find . . . 
New faith and trust in each other, 
And peace of mind! 

Come and join me in a prayer, 
If we all kneel side by side, 
In a prayer for peace, 
How can we be denied?
