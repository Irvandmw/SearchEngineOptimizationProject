Darling
You're hiding in the closet once again
Start smiling
I know you're trying
Real hard not to turn your head away
Pretty darling
Face tomorrow, tomorrow is not yesterday
Yesterday oh oooooh

Pretty please
I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Darling
I was there once a while ago
I know
That it's hard to be stuck with
People that you love
When nobody trusts

Pretty please
I know it's a drag (Know it's a drag)
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (Put up your head)
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
That I can
Ohh

And you're not the only one whose been through
I've been there alone and now so are you
I just want you to know, want you to know it's not your fault
It's not your fault, ohh, ohh
Your fault, your fault
It's not your fault
Your fault, your fault, your fault

Pretty please
I know it's a drag (Know it's a drag)
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (Put up your head)
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can

Pretty please
I know it's a drag (Know it's a drag)
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (Put up your head)
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
That I can
Ohh

Darling
You're hiding in the closet once again
Start smiling
