Lyrics:


Ever since I saw you standing there
I couldn't get you outta my mind
So I thought I'd come and talk you
But you couldn't understand my lines
Girl it's like in our chemistry
There was something that gave me the sign
From the moment that I saw your spanish eyes

Couldn't figure out a word she was saying
But I could see you were looking amazing
Give me some help I need the translation
What does "te querio" really mean? Tell me

"Senorita, la chica bonita" are the only words I know
I wish that I could hold you and dar te um beso
I wanna take you home
Cos I really really like you style
I can see you wanna get buck wild
"Senorita, la chica bonita" are the only words I know
"Chico bonito me atraes"

Now the situation stresses m
cos I know what I've got in my hand
There's a millions things I wanna say
Like I really wanna be your man
Anticipation stresses me
coz I'm trying to get through to you
Body language is the only thing to use

Couldn't figure out a word she was saying
But I could see you were looking amazing
Give me some help I need the translation
What does "te querio" really mean?

Tell me

[Chorus]

Her body's calling
And I think I'm Falling
But I can't understand what she says
Chico bonito me atraes
Di me de onde vienes
Â¿Eres de aqui?
Me gusta tu estilo
Â¿Sabes lo que te digo?
What does te querio really mean?
