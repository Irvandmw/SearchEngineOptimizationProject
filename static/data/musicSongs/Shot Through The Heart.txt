Lyrics:


Shot through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we call love.

Would you be content to see me crying
After all those little games you put me through?
After all I've done for you, you're lying.
Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth?

Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything.
Now here's the curtain call.

And I'm shot through the heart
As I lay there alone
In the dark.
Through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we call love.

Now you've come back here to say you're sorry.
I just don't know who you're talking to.
It could be the man I used to be, girl.
I've grown up, and now I'm over you.

Standing there, just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn.
You were gonna set the world on fire,
But you'll never learn

That you're shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark.
Through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we call love.

Standing there just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn.
You were gonna set the world on fire,
But you'll never learn.

Now, you're shot.

Baby does what baby please.
Baby must have what she sees.
But not this time: the tables turned,
And baby just got burned.

Shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark.
Through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we callâ

Shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark.
Through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we callâ

Shot through the heart (shot)
As I lay there alone in the dark (shot).
Through the heart (shot).

Shot. [7x]
