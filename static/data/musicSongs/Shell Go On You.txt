Lyrics:


If you've got a little girl, you better take the time
To go to her tea parties and give her a piggyback ride
Be a dragon or a dinosaur every chance you get
Cause one day you can bet

She'll go on you
Before you turn can around
And it's so lonley watchin' that
Fast train leavin' town
Better cherish her every second of your life
Cause this preacious little thing that we call time
She'll go on you

If you got a special one
You better love her everyday
Leave her notes on the fridgerater door
And send her sweet bouquets
Always be her confidant
A safe place for her to rest
Or that little thing you call you happiness

She'll go on you
Before you turn around
And it's so lonley watchin' that
Fast train leavin' town
Better cherish her every second of your life
Take her in your arms and do her right
She'll go on you

If you've got you momma there
You outta thank her everyday
For nursin' all your colds and
Sittin' up when you'd stay out late
Now all her hair is grey, and every year she's not as strong
One of these days before to long

She'll go on you
Before you turn around
And it's so lonley watchin' that
Fast train leavin' town
Better cherish her every second of your life
Cause before you get the chance to goodbye
She'll go on you

Yeah this preacious little thing that we call life
She'll go on you
