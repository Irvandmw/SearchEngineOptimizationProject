Lyrics:


Many prophets preach on bended knee. Many clerics wasted wine.
Do the bloodied sheets on those cobbled streets mean I have wasted time?
Are there silver shores on paradise? Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a far away land, my enemy I'm told.
I really want you to really want me, but I really don't know if you can do that.
I know you want to know what's right but I know it's so hard for you to do that.
And time's running out as often it does, and often dictates that you can't do that.
But fate can't break this feeling inside that's burning up through my veins.
I really want you.
I really want you.
I really want you - now.
No matter what I say or do, the message isn't getting through,
And you're listening to the sound of my breaking heart.
I really want you.
I really want you.
Is a poor man rich in solitude, or will Mother Earth complain?
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day, but Lady Luck for rain?
They say a million people bow and scrape to an effigy of gold.
I saw life begin and the ship we're in and history unfold.
I really want you to really want me but I really don't know if you can do that.
I know you want to know what's right but I know it's so hard for you to do that.
And time's running out as often it does and often dictates that you can't do that.
But fate can't break this feeling inside that's burning up through my veins.
I really want you.
I really want you.
I really want you - now.
No matter what I say or do, the message isn't getting through,
And you're listening to the sound of my breaking heart.
No matter what I say or do, the message isn't getting through,
And you're listening to the sound of my breaking heart.
