Lyrics:


Arriverderci, Roma
Goodbye, goodbye to Rome
City of a million moon lit faces
City of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces
Far from home

Arriverderci, Roma
It's time for us to part
Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning
In her heart

Arriverderci, Roma
It's time for us to part

Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning
In her heart
