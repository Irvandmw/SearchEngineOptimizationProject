[Bebe Rexha:]
I've been a good girl
I've been a good girl all week long
I've been a good girl
And I know that it's wrong
Keep up the pace boy
You know I don't like when you go slow
Gotta be right boy
I'mma give you a show

So won't you let me pour a drink
Let me pour a drink all over my body
Let me do a dance
Let me do a dance that you like, baby let me be naughty

I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Let me be naughty
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?

You're my boss, you're my boss, you're my boss
You're my baby, I'm your lady, I'm your lady tonight
And I'mma show you how I'mma do you right
And you know that it's gonna be naughty

So won't you let me pour a drink
Let me pour a drink all over my body
Let me do a dance
Let me do a dance that you like baby let me be naughty

I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Let me be naughty
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?

[Offset:]
Offset!
Beat it up just like Mike Tyson
I just wiped a bitch with a Dyson
She wanna eat it like a tootsie roll
I'mma score her up just like a goal
I'm offset you know I'm legendary
Lactose Intolerant don't eat no dairy
Yeah I'm black and rich and whipped and hairy
Naughty boy yeah I'm very

[Bebe Rexha:]
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Let me be naughty
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
