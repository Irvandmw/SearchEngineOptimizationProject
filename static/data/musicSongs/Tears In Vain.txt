Lyrics:


I don't wanna love you, but I do
And I just can't help it
You bring me happiness and anything

All these nights, I spend, crying over you
Really worth it, really really really worth it
Or am I shedding tears in vain? (tears in vain)

You know every guy's got to have someone he can depend on
Someone to trust in
And I depend on you, day by day
It's always been that way

When you kiss me, tears of joy I shed
Makes me wonder, really really makes me wonder
Wonder am I shedding tears in vain (tears in vain)
Makes me wonder am Iâ¦
Wonder am I shedding tears in vain (tears in vain)
