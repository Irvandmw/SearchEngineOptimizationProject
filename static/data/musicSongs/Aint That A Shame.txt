Lyrics:


You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

You broke my heart
When you said, "We part"
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Boogie, babe

Ain't that a shame?
Ain't that a shame?
Look out

Farewell, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Boogie, babe

Ain't that a shame?
Ain't that a shame?

You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
