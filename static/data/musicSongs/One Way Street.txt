Lyrics:


I wanna climb Mount Everest
I wanna see the girls undressed
I wanna drift across the sea in a hot balloon 

I wanna jump out from a plane
And you could say that I'm insane
I'll count to twenty before i loose the parachute 

Theres gonna be no single stone
that I didn't turn
there's gonna be no single lesson that I didn't learn 

[Chorus:]
Never wanna let a chance go by
I'm gonna spread my wings and fly
I won't look back or slow the speed
cos' living is a one way street 

I'm gonna whistle all kinds of tunes
get lazy in the afternoons
and ket my thoughts travel with me to the moon 

I'm gonna get my share of love
I'll be praying to the skies above
I need to know if there is someone watching us 

There's gonna be no single stone... 

[Chorus:] Never wanna let a chance go by
I'm gonna spread my wings and fly
I won't look back or slow the speed
cos' living is a one way street 

Never wanna let a dance go by
Never wanna miss a look in your eyes
I won't look back or slow the speed
cos' living is a one way street
