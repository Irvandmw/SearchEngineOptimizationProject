Lyrics:


Like an island rain
That comes in out of nowhere
You might not choose to go there
But it hits you just the same
Close your eyes and see what matters
Wash away your worry and pain
There's holy water
In an island rain

Maybe what you have ain't what you wanted
Where you are ain't where you want to be
Maybe you feel tied down
Maybe something's gonna come around
And set you free

Like an island rain
That comes in out of nowhere
You might not choose to go there
But it hits you just the same
Close your eyes and see what matters
Wash away your worry and pain
There's holy water
In an island rain

Every day is a blessing to be counted
Every night is a lesson to be learned
Watching the world go round
Takes a whole lot of up and down
To make it turn

Like an island rain
That comes in out of nowhere
You might not choose to go there
But it hits you just the same
Close your eyes and see what matters
Wash away your worry and pain
There's holy water
In an island rain
In an island rain
In an island rain
