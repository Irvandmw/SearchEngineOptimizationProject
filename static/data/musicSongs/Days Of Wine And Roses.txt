Lyrics:


The days of wine and roses, 
Laugh and run away, 
Like a child at play, 
Through a meadowland, 
Toward a closing door, 
A door marked never more, 
That wasn't there before. 

The lonely night discloses, 
Just a passing breeze, 
Filled with memories, 
Of the golden smile, 
That introduced me to, 
The days of wine and roses, 
And you! 

The lonely night discloses, 
Just a passing breeze, 
Filled with memories, 
Of the golden smile, 
That introduced me to, 
The days of wine and roses, 
And you!
