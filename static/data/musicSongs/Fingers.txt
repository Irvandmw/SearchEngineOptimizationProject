Lyrics:


(Ahh, Ah,Ha,Ha,Ha,Ha)
(Yeah, Mhmm)
(Mmm, Uhh)

Iâm alone now
Staring at the ceiling
(Uh, Uh)
Iâm kina bored now
I canât sleep
(I Canât Sleep, Uh, Uh)

And you only can make my life complete
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)
and when come you slip into a dream
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)

When itâs late at night and youâre fast a sleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
I let my fingers do the walking

(Sth, Mmm)

Iâm starving (Sth)
For some attention
Iâm begging, pleading, bleeding
For a suggestion
(Uh, Uh, Uh)

I bite my tongue because I wanna scream
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)
Iâm almost there then you turn and look at me
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)

When itâs late at night and youâre fast a sleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
(I let my fingers do the walking)

Rewind and you will see
(You will see)
while in the morning Iâm happy
(Iâm happy)
Right there on the TV screen
(On the TV)
(Â¡ME VENGO, ME VENGO!) [Spanish. English: "I'm comming, I'm comming" ]

(Ahh, uh, Uh, Uh, uh)
Iâm restless
You need some caffeine
(Ah, Ha, Ha, Ha)
I'm wasted
If you could only see
(only see)

'cause I need more than you are gonna give
(Uh, Uh. Ah, IE)

When itâs late at night and youâre fast a sleep
I let my fingers do the walking
(AHHHHHH)!
I press record I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
(No, No, No No)

When itâs late at night and youâre fast a sleep
I let my fingers do the walking
(My fingers do the walking)
I press record I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
(No one else is watching)
(I let my fingers do the walking)

(Ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah Uh, Uh, uh Huh
