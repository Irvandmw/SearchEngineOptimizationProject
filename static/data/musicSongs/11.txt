[Akevius:]
It's just me and you, baby, 'bout to pull up
One plus one equals you, baby, you already know
Give you my love, you drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)
You're my only lady (Lady)
My lil' baby (Ah, yeah)
It's just me and you, baby, 'bout to pull up
One plus one equals you, baby, you already know
Give you my love, you drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)
You're my only lady (Lady)
My lil' baby (Ah, yeah)

She my cutie, stupid booty
Girl, I love it when you shake it
She the realest, she the illest
No one got nothin' on my baby, that's my lady
To keep it G
If I tell her, she gon' take it, just for me (Me)
She the G.O.A.T. watch her glow
Ooh, you know I fell like Baby Jesus (Ah, yeah)
Ooh, and I got water, you my dope, you my drug
'Bout to overdose on love
You the shit, you the pit
Let's get rich, let's go

It's just me and you, baby, 'bout to pull up
One plus one equals you, baby, you already know
Give you my love, you drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)
You're my only lady (Lady)
My lil' baby (Ah, yeah)
It's just me and you, baby, 'bout to pull up
One plus one equals you, baby, you already know
Give you my love, you drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)
You're my only lady (Lady)
My lil' baby (Ah, yeah)

[DaBaby:]
Ayy, look
You know you're the only one I care about (Yeah)
You like to hit my line and ask me for my whereabouts (Brr, brr)
We hold hands on them beaches, got 'em staring now (Hah)
They play with you, they play with me, I come and air it out
Okay, I still remember when I met ya'
Saw ya' pictures, it was sexy
Hit your DM's, hit the message
And they got up in my business, now it's messy
Got you thinking I'm finessing
Steady giving me a lecture, you know?
Bump into your hoe, might just snatch her up (Yeah)
I put dick all on bae, she been actin' up (Ah)
Like to make a her come fast, that ain't fast enough
Grabbing her ass with both hands, make her back it up
I know she a freak and, yeah, I love it
I ain't trying to hide from you when you see us out in public
And I ain't into actin' tough for all these niggas
Better check on my credentials
Know you seein' how I'm coming, lil' nigga
I'm always finished when they start with me (Bitch)
I get that pussy, then I dip like it's a robbery
She say I'm all up in her, like to flip her 'round and bend her
Told me I be puttin' dick in all of her arteries
Write my name in that thing, I be killin' it
Don't kiss me bitch, no, you not bae, we just chillin'
You keep runnin' your mouth on IG
I'ma come see your B and play with your children

[Akevius:]
It's just me and you, baby, 'bout to pull up
One plus one equals you, baby, you already know
Give you my love, you drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)
You're my only lady (Lady)
My lil' baby (Ah, yeah)
It's just me and you, baby, 'bout to pull up
One plus one equals you, baby, you already know
Give you my love, you drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)
You're my only lady (Lady)
My lil' baby (Ah, yeah)
