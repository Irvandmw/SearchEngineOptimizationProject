Song Name: Can't Stop Crying
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Forty days and nights without a word
Except for shouting at the ceiling
Me without you just seems so absurd
Like a touch without the feeling
Tell me how
Not to want you now

The sun is giving up on yet another day
And I can't stop crying
I wish that I could be like you and just walk away
But I can't stop crying
These tears for a love that's passed me by

Shadow-covered memories fuel the pain
And there's always another
Seems that you and I, we feel the same
About everything, but each other
I don't know how
Not to love you now

The sun is giving up on yet another day
And I can't stop crying
I wish that I could be like you and just walk away
But I can't stop crying
tThese Tears for a love that's passed me by

The sun is giving up on yet another day
And I can't stop crying
I wish that I could be like you and just walk away
But I can't stop crying
Crying
These tears for a love that's passed me by
