Baby you can roll
Roll with us
And I know that you know
You know bitches

And bros with us
And baby you can roll
Maybe you can roll
Roll with us yeah

You living that drug life, yeah yeh yeh
You could come and party with my bitches yeah
Nobody ask your name
Not monogamous
This ain't gon' be over 'til you done with this
Never thought that you'd ever get used to this
Doing stupid shit but you won't do this
(Know you can't)

Baby you can roll
Roll with us
And I know that you know
You know bitches

And bros with us
And baby you can roll
And you know you can roll
Roll with us yeah

Roll, roll with us

Roll, roll with us

Maybe you can roll
Roll with us yeah

You roll that drama out the door
The shit can wait
And boy you know you ain't just fly
'Cause I'm in LA
