Lyrics:


Not anyone can move you this way (No way)
Finally gotcha loose from the cage (Ok)
I ain't tryna smooze with flowers, baby (No playin' no games)
I'd rather make a power play (No playin' no games)
Imagine all the lives that we can change
You don't even know the power you got in them legs
Pick up your face and be proud for once (Proud for once)
Take off your cool, but keep stylin' on 'em (Keep stylin' on 'em)

Ok, now don't slack
I need all my racks
No, we don't hold back
Act like you know that
go tell your old man
Go get your whole fam'
Fly like the ghost man
Taking all I can

I just came to feel all that is made for me
I was made to be the change we really, really, need

I'm up before the rooster, ya dig? (Ooh, you dig?)
I had to jump the moon to get big (Ooh, to get big)
How many stone grooves will it take? (Ok)
For you to skip on my funk lake (Oh, oh, ok)
Imagine all the lives that we can save
You don't even know the power you got in them legs
Pick up your face and be proud for once (Proud for once)
Go quit ya gig and get down with us (Keep stylin' on 'em)

Ok, now don't slack
I need all my racks
No, we don't hold back
Act like you know that
go tell your old man
Go get your whole fam'
Fly like the ghost man
Taking all I can

I just came to feel all that is made for me
I was made to be the change we really, really, need

Now, fill up the whole tank
And I drive in the cold rain
And I run like a nose bleed
And can't nobody hold me hold me hold me hold me hold me hold me hold me

Ok, now don't slack
I need all my racks
No, we don't hold back
Act like you know that
go tell your old man
Go get your whole fam'
Fly like the ghost man
Taking all I can

(I feel different now, ya know)
(Come on)
I was made to love (I was made to love)

I just came to get the love that was made for me
(I just came to get the love that was made for me)
I was made to be the change that we really need
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say it)

I just came to feel all that is made for me
I was made to be the change we really, really, need
I just came to feel all that is made for me
I was made to be the change we really, really, need
