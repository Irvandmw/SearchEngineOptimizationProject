Lyrics:


Ain't gonna try anymore to forget about you
Ain't gonna try anymore what good does it do

I took your photograph and turned it to the wall
I burned your letters one by one but it didn't help at all
Ain't gonna try anymore to forget about you
Ain't gonna try anymore, what good does it do

Some day I'd like to forget this loneliness in my heart
But still a part of me in your memory so I know know how to start
Ain't gonna try anymore to forget about you
Ain't gonna try anymore what good does it do
Ain't gonna try anymore to forget about you
Ain't gonna try anymore what good does it do
(What good would it do)
