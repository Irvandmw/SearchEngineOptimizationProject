Lyrics:


I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well thatâs good enough for me
Donât need the real thing
Thatâs just another thing 
For me to try to tame
Donât know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Iâd be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thatâs the closest youâll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thatâs the closest to a cowboy
Youâll see me

Before I met him 
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Iâd be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thatâs the closest youâll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thatâs the closest to a cowboy
Youâll see me

It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But Iâll never look
At a sunset the same night

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thatâs the closest youâll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
Thatâs the closest youâll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thatâs the closest to a cowboy
Youâll see me
