Lyrics:


(That old time feeling's still inside my heart)
Well I'm sorry but it took me by susrprice
To be looking in those old familiar eyes
If I'm acting funny please don't turn away
Seeing you has brought me back to yesterday
Yes you're looking at the fool who used to be
In another world where love was new to me
But I learned my lesson when I let you go
And there's one thing that I've wanted you to know
If that old time feeling ever starts again
And you think about the way it might have been
Don't let yesterday's mistakes keep us apart
Cause that old time feeling's still inside my heart
Yes that old time feeling ever starts again...
(Inside my heart)
