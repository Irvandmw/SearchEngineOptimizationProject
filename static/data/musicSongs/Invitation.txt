Lyrics:


2003, with the flow. Blue.

Ooh right, finished work on a Saturday night
In a mood and I wanna play
I say in for my click around my way
Hit the joint where the play is at
Shinin' and strictly cash
Ladies, tell me if you're feelin' me

Ooh, all I wanna do.
Is chill out with my crew
Maybe find myself some company (find myself come company).

If you're feelin' it tonight and you wanna do me right. 
You gotta shuffle a little and groove with me,
It's a blue invitation, just come with me.

If you're feelin' it tonight and you wanna do me right. 
You gotta shuffle a little and groove with me,
It's a blue invitation, just come with me.

Shorty if you wanna dance and groove with me, this is your invitation 
If you wanna dance and groove with me, this is your invitation.

In the club and I feel the heat, nice girls by the side of me
I see, which one will be single and free
So I step to check the vibe
I can see it in her eyes (her eyes), she likes to put on this disguise

All I wanna do, is chill out with my crew
Maybe find myself some company (find myself come company).

If you're feelin' it tonight and you wanna do me right. 
You gotta shuffle a little and groove with me
It's a blue invitation, just come with me.

Gotta shuffle, just a little
Ooh baby just groove with me 

If you're feelin' it tonight and you wanna do me right. 
You gotta shuffle a little and groove with me
It's a blue invitation, just come with me.

If you wanna dance and groove with me, this is your invitation.
