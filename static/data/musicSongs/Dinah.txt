Lyrics:


Dinah, is there anyone finer
In the state of Carolina
If there is and you know her
Show her to me

Dinah, with her dixie eyes blazin'
How I'd love to sit and gaze in
To the eyes of Dinah Lee

Every night, why do I, shake with fright
Because my Dinah might
Change her mind about me

Dinah, if she wandered to China
I would hop an ocean liner
Just to be with Dinah Lee

Every night, why do I, shake with fright
Because my Dinah might
Change her mind about me

Dinah, if she wandered to China
I would hop an ocean liner
Just to be with Dinah Lee
Dinah Lee
