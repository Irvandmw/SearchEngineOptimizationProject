Lyrics:


Away in a manger, no crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay

Mary was that mother, mine
Jesus Christ, her little child

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, come down from the sky
And stay by my bedside 'til morning is nigh

Mary was that mother, mine
Jesus Christ, her little child
Mary was that mother, mine
Jesus Christ, her little, little child

The stars in the bright sky look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay

Mary was that mother, mine
Jesus Christ, little child
Mary was that mother, mine
Jesus Christ, her little child
Mary was that mother, mine
Jesus Christ, her little child
Mary was that mother, mine
Jesus Christ, her little child
