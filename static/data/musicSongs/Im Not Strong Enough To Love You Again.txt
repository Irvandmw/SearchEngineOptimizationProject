Lyrics:


You say you love me, and you wanna come back home
That you're so sorry for doing me wrong
Would be in sorry, baby, can not change the way I feel
'Cause when I think about forgiving you I remind it in my own tears

No, I'm not strong enough, aha, to love you again, no, no
I ain't strong enough, aha, baby, to love you again, no, I ain't

The day you left me I asked myself why
And you don't know, you don't know how much I cried
And now you wanna come back, knowing I still weep for you
Well, if you got any kind of heart, please, please, don't ask me some, dear, oh

No, I'm not strong enough, no, baby, to love you again, no, no, I ain't
I ain't gonna let myself, I just ain't gonna do it, love you one more time, no, no
I ain't strong enough, I can not do it, baby, love you again, no, no, ohohohoho...
I'm not strong enough to love you, to love you again, no, I ain't, no, I ain't

Later for you, baby, much, much later for you, baby
I ain't gonna do it no more, no, I ain't, heyeyeyeyeyey...
I'm not strong enough to love you, to love you one more time, no, no, ohohohohohoho...
I'm not strong enough, I ain't gonna do it, baby, I ain't gonna love you no more, no, I ain't

Oh, yeah, I ain't strong enough, I ain't gonna do it, I ain't gonna do it, I ain't gonna do it, I, I, I, I
I ain't strong enough, to love you one more time, no, I ain't, no, I ain't, baby
Ooh, not strong enough, to love you, to love you one more time, I ain't gonna do it
Oh, oh, oh, Lord, I ain't gonna do it, baby, I ain't gonna love you one game, get you mercy, heyeyeyey...
Not strong enough
