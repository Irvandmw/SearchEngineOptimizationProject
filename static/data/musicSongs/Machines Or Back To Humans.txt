Lyrics:


Machines. [repeat]

It's a machine's world.
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul.
When the machines take over,
It ain't no place for rock'n'roll.

They tell me I don't care,
But deep inside I'm just a man.

They freeze me, they burn me,
They squeeze me, they stress me.
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me,
But no one, but no one, but no one can wrest me away.

Back to humans.

We have no disease, no troubles of mind.
We are fighting for peace, no regard for the time.
We never cry, we never retreat.
We have no conception of love or defeat.

What's that machine noise?
It's bytes and mega chips for tea.
It's that machine, boys
With random-access memory.

Never worry, never mind.
Not for money, not for gold.

Its software, its hardware,
Its heartbeat, its time-share,
Its midwife's a disk drive,
Its sex life is quantised.
Its self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised.

Back to humans.
Back to humans.

Back to machines.
Machines.
Machines.
Machines.
Machines.

Living in a new world.
Thinking in the past.
Humans.
Living in a new world.
How you gonna last?
Humans.

Machine world.
It's a machine's world.

Living in a new world.
Thinking in the past.
Back to humans.
Living in a new world.
How you gonna last?

Machine world.
Machine world.
Machine world.

Change.

Machine world.

Yeah, I'm coming.

Back to humans.
Back to humans.
Back to humans.

Living in a new world.
How you gonna last?
Machine world.
It's a machine's world.
