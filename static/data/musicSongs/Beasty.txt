Lyrics:


All that we know is the logos and HB
The Glock got no safety, don't face me, I do it
Please do not push me, you think that I'm pussy?
I got too much to lose, nigga don't make me lose it
I can't be trusting no bitch, is you stupid?
I came with a shooter, he came with a Ruger
I just seen one of my bros on the news
I can't call him no more, he respect why I do it
I'm in the big body Benz with my friends
And it look like we just hit a lick off the jeweler
Look like a dope boy, I hop out a Rolls
They taking my flows like I said they can use it
Dirty Diana, I'm pushing a Phantom
I know that they wanna see me in a Buick
Me and my brethren is twenty-one deep, you see gang in the shows like they don't know my music
Fuck all them bitches that shitted on me when I didn't have money
You bitches so stupid
I'm from the trenches where niggas get hit for nothing
You better get on your bully
Niggas be acting so tough
You can front if you want
Got some shit that could knock down a bully
Niggas be talking the police
You don't even know me
You only here listening to music

Talking to the feds is a no-no
I can get bread with my eyes closed
Insecure, so she got lipo
VVSs on me, that's a light show
Hizzy get litty like a light show
Nigga I'm litty like a light show
If it's 'bout money, I'ma go-go
But the-, yo, she a ho-ho

Too addicted, hard to stop it
Fell in love with Saint Laurent shit
Louis luggage this is marvelous
Flyest nigga's out the Bronx yeah
And we come straight from Highbridge
I sleep good, don't wanna die yet
Don't get caught up in my projects
I don't need no yes men 'round me
Talking about lets get fleet-fleet
Come around tryna get tree-tree
Popping on pills with the bean-bean
Rolling through the hills off the lean-lean
Don't hate me, just love me
Melody nigga she need me
Don't need kisses through the TV
Look at me now I'm beasty
I'm beasty, I'm beasty, too OD, I'm beasty
Nigga I cut her off easy
Word to my mother, I'm beasty, I'm beasty
Saint Laurent sweater cost three Gs
Fucking on the bro, just to meet me
Okay you would eat her like E-E

Talking to the feds is a no-no
I can get bread with my eyes closed
Insecure, so she got lipo
VVSs on me, that's a light show
Hizzy get litty like a light show
Nigga I'm litty like a light show
If it's 'bout money, I'ma go-go
But the-, yo, she a hoe-hoe
