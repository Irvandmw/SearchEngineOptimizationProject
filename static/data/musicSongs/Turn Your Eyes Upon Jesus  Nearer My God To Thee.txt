Lyrics:


Hmmm.....
And all the world go free
Now there's a cross for everyone
And there's a cross for me

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,
In the light of His Wonderful grace.

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
