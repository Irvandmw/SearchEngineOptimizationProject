Lyrics:


On Christmas morning you woke up
To static on the radio
Someone must have turned it on
Who? You didn't know

You got up slowly sleepy eyed
To a tune that stationed in
Turned the dial a little while
Then a voice said
"Let the party begin!"

Hey hey hey
and
Ho ho ho
and
Now its time
For the jolly DJ show

I heard Santa on the radio
I knew it was Santa on the raido
Mixing up the music like a Santa should
And radio
Radio
Never sounded so good

He was busy findin bustin beats
Makin it up as he went along
Hip hop, rock, and electronic
St. Nick could do no wrong

Turnin the rythem inside out
Till the people shook the house
Pretty soon every creature was dancing
Every boy and girl and every mouse

Hey hey hey
and
Ho ho ho
Now its time for the jolly DJ show

I heard Santa on the radio
I knew it was Santa on the radio
Mixing up the music like a Santa should
And radio
Radio
Never sounded so good

All the music comes together
All the people just let go
All the world is listenin to the jolly DJ show
Hey hey hey
and
Ho ho ho

I heard Santa on the radio
I knew it was Santa on the radio
Mixing up the music like a Santa should
And radio
Radio radio
Never sounded so good

I heard Santa on the radio
I knew it was Santa on the radio
Mixing up the music like a Santa should
And radio
Radio
Never sounded so good

I heard Santa on the radio
I knew it was Santa on the radio
Mixing up the music like a Santa should
And radio
Radio radio
Never sounded so good

And radio
Never sounded so good

Yeah yeah
Oh ho
Yeah yeah
Oh ho

Yeah yeah
