Lyrics:


I had no intention I would get fucked up tonight
When I looked in your eyes and they went through me like a knife
I came here with my crew, I lost them
Came with my cool, I dropped it
And if I'm being honest, I'm being honest

I can't think when you're looking like that
Can't breathe when you're moving like that
Tell me when you're gonna do me like that (yea)
I'm too weak and I never like that
Light-speed and I think I might crash
One trip down and I'll never go back

But everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife (yeah, I said it)
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife (alright)

Maybe it's the music or the red stain on your lips
I wonder when's the right time to go in for a kiss
But I'm thinking past that lover, I'm ready to meet your momma
If I'm being honest, I'm being honest

I can't think when you're looking like that
Can't breathe when you're moving like that
Tell me when you're gonna do me like that (yea)
I'm too weak and I never like that
Light-speed and I think I might crash
One trip down and I'll never go back

But everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife (yeah, I said it)
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife (alright)

Baby, baby, baby
You got me talking crazy
I figure if I say it
You just might be my lady
Baby, it's you, yeah
Baby, it's you, yeah
And oooh, I feel like something good is 'bout to be going on
And baby it's you, yeah
And baby it's you, yeah

And everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife (c'mon)
And everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife (sing it with me)
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife (alright, c'mon)
Everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife (c'mon)
