Lyrics:


There's a string wrapped around my finger
It's getting tighter every day
And it just goes on forever
It's wrapped around every word you said

It's like a memory, a shoebox in my mind
Calling out to me to open up and look inside
It makes me believe and all we could've been
But all the things we were is just me imagining

Take these red balloons
And watch them fly away
I'm untying my heart
And letting go today

Time has come for me to see the truth
Walk up to the edge
I'm letting go
Of these red balloons

There's a shadow when I walk forward
And it keeps trying to hold me back
I can cry at the strangest moments
Reminding me of what I can't have

Don't wanna find even
All we could've been
Cause I'm so tired of
Everything I'm imagining

Take these red balloons
And watch them fly away
I'm untying my heart
And letting go today

Time has come for me to see the truth
Walk up to the edge
I'm letting go
Of these red balloons

The child in me
Wants to run and collect
Every single balloon
I'll never forget

The child in me
Wants to live in a dream
Of carousels
And wishing wells

Take these red balloons
And watch them fly away
I'm untying my heart
And letting go today

Cause every single dream in the past
Does nothing for me but hold me back
Time has come for me to see the truth
I walk up to the edge and let go of these red balloons

Red balloons, red balloons, red balloons
Has been blown away
Tears are in my eyes
I say... goodbye
