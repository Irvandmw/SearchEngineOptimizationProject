Lyrics:


I don't care where you're from 
If you're smart or you're dumb 
If you wanna be a bad guy or Mr. Right 
I don't care what you say 
I'mma go my own way 
You go yours 
And maybe we'll meet up someday 

Make it up 
(Make it up) 
As you go 
(As you go) 
Future's wide open 
Nothing's written in stone 
(Make it up) 
Make it up 
(As you go) 
As you go 
Future's wide open 
Nothing's written in stone 

I don't care what you think 
I'mma do my own thing 
Cut my own hair 
Don't care if you like it 
Just a matter of taste 
And all the time you waste 
Will get you there in fashionable time 

Make it up 
(Make it up) 
As you go 
(As you go) 
Future's wide open 
Nothing's written in stone 
(Make it up) 
Make it up 
(As you go) 
As you go 
Future's wide open 
Nothing's written in stone 
Better make it up as you go 

There's no need for lies 
They have begun when your eyes meet the sun 
We don't need any roads 
Put your feet on the ground 
And forget what you know 
Don't make it down 
Make it up as you go 

I can't tell you what's best 
I don't know what comes next 
All I know is that I don't know anything 
All I got is today, and I prefer it that way 
Make a plan, but I know it's gonna change 
And that's okay 

Make it up 
(Make it up) 
As you go 
(As you go) 
Future's wide open 
Nothing's written in stone 
(Make it up) 
Make it up 
(As you go) 
As you go 
Future's wide open 
Nothing's written in stone 

(Make it up) 
Make it up 
(As you go) 
As you go 
Future's wide open 
Nothing's written in stone 
Better make it up as you go 
Better make it up as you go 
Better make it up as you go 
Better make it up as you go
