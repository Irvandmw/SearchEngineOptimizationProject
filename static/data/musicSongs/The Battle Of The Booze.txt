Lyrics:


In chilly northern climates
Where they could not grow the vine
They perfected a distillation
Which has stood the test of time
Derided by the gentry
As the drink of peasantry
It has conquered half the world
With its ghostly subtlety

In the battle of the booze
Vodka takes the crown
It hits you when you're up
Kicks you when you're down
While sailing through the world
Use some common sense
The juices of the grain
Make life more intense

The first one on a Friday
Is my highlight of the week
It's the first stop on the journey
To the oblivion I seek
I'll take this way in future
As I took this way before
It warms me from the inside
As it opens up the door

In the battle of the booze
Vodka takes the crown
It hits you when you're up
Kicks you when you're down
While sailing through the world
Use some common sense
The juices of the grain
Make life more intense

Many are the kinds of agitation that it stills
Equalling the number of the brain cells that it kills
Its aim is true and so are you when you have it imbibed
It loves to bring to light what you keep hidden

In the battle of the booze
Vodka takes the crown
It hits you when you're up
And it kicks you when you're down
While sailing through the world
Use some common sense
The juices of the grain
Make life more intense

In the battle of the booze
Vodka takes the crown
It hits you when you're up
And it kicks you when you're down
While sailing through the world
Use some common sense
The juices of the grain
Make life more intense
