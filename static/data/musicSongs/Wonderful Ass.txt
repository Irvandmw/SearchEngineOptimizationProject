Lyrics:


You do not understand my quirky ways
My crazy logic leaves you in a daze
Think my neurosis is just a phase
You've got a wonderful ass

You're so wonderful
Wonderful
You're so wonderful
(You've got a wonderful ass)

You think that all my friends are my bedmates
True love before sex you just can't relate
My sensibilities you aggravate
You've got a wonderful ass

You're so wonderful
Wonderful
You're so wonderful
(You've got a wonderful ass)

Listen:
Educate
Tolerate
Negotiate
Communicate
Litigate
Graduate
Appreciate
Separate
Interrogate
Violate
Fluctuate
Perpetrate
Masturbate
Stimulate, stimulate, stimulate

You say that you love me, it don't do no good
You want me to trust you, I wish that I could
You cannot build a house with plastic wood
You've got a wonderful ass

You're so wonderful
Wonderful
You're so wonderful
(You've got a wonderful ass)
You've got a wonderful, wonderful ass
[x2]

I guess what it is is that I hate your ideas of fun (Oh yeah?)
But baby I rate your ass number one
I don't usually have time to drink from your glass
But I can always find time for your ass
You know what I'm talkin' about baby?
(Yeah)
I'm talkin about that... ass
(Too sexy in here, yeah)

The Revolution will be heard!
The Revolution will be heard!

You're so wonderful!
You're so wonderful!
You've got a wonderful ass (You've got a wonderful ass)

You do not understand my quirky ways
Girl, you've got a wonderful
You've got a wonderful
You've got a wonderful, wonderful ass

You don't understand my quirky ways, yeah
(You don't understand my quirky ways, but..)
My crazy logic leaves you in a daze
(You're in a daze, oh I like that ass)
But you've got that wonderful ass

Baby, you think all my friends are my bedmates, yeah
(Well, you sleep around all the time)
Hey now baby, true love before sex you can't relate, yeah (True true love)
But you've got that wonderful ass, babe
My sensibilities you aggravate (I understand)
(You try to fuck for love)
You, why can't, can't you relate, yeah
You've got a wonderful ass

I like it (I like it)
I said I like it (Said I like it)
Wonderful
You know I like that ass (Really?)
