Lyrics:


Sorry it's late - I know I missed your call again
Been tryin' to change - got stuck in my ways again
I been feelin' faded, disconnected lately
Missing what money can't buy
All I wanna do is be brand new
I swear I'll give it all up just for you

And I would sink my house down under water, ooh-ooh
I would trade all my gold for dirt
Lemme tell ya right now
I would walk through fire just to hold ya
Whatever gets me closer to you
Whatever gets me closer to you

(Closer to you)

Sick of the game - never holdin' on to what I start
Helluva shame - I almost got the life I want
Got no one to take to Paris, France
To understand the man I am
I feel like I'm running outta time
Oh tell me why our stars just don't align

I would sink my house down under water, ooh-ooh
I would trade all my gold for dirt
Lemme tell ya right now
I would walk through fire just to hold ya
Whatever gets me closer to you
Whatever gets me closer to

Your touch, your love
I want it all too much, I'm cryin'
I'd give the shirt off my back just to get you back
Baby, baby, I'd lie in the eye of a hurricane
Just to have you blow me back
To when you still believed in me
Baby believe me

And I would sink my house down under water
And I would trade all my gold for dirt
Lemme tell ya right now
I would walk through fire just to hold ya
Whatever gets me closer to you
Whatever gets me closer to you

Closer to you
Oh, a little closer to you
Closer to you
