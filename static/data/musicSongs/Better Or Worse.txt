Lyrics:


Weâve been down this road before
Lost the key that fits the door
Believing it was finally gone for good
Here we are, the perfect pair
In a state of disrepair
Saying all the things we swore we never would
And the words that mean the most
Hang between us like a ghost
Left unspoken

But I
Iâm gonna love you even when it hurts
Yeah, I
Iâm gonna love you
For better or worse

Everywhere I look around
It seems when things break down
Itâs easier to just throw them away
But a promise left to die
Can sometimes still surprise
And start breathing in the morningâs light of day
And the hearts that learn to bend
Are the only ones who mend
When theyâre broken

[Chorus]

And I havenât got a clue
Baby, any more than you
Where weâre goinâ

[Chorus]
