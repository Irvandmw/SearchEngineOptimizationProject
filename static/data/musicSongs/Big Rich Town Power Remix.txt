Lyrics:


[Trey Songz:]
They say this is a big, rich town, yeah, yeah
And I just come from the poorest part, oh woah
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I just happen to come up hard (Come up hard)
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

[50 Cent:]
I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn
Yeah slick talker, shit talker, New Yorker
Collectin' property, playin' Monopoly (Ha, ha)
You might want bond with us, build and break bread
You think I'm fucking 'round, look there's money to make, yeah
More snakes than rats, just a habit to my appetite
Rap this rap, I'ma show you who to blame of that
God damn can we all just get along? (No)
Hell no, not when you forget who put you on (Yeah)
My plug he need the keys to success
Take two and make three to the best
Cruel shit, not weak shit, I got this
Fearless not careless now watch this
Money flip like it's suppose to flip
Read up, then double up, watch me hit the lick

[Trey Songz:]
They say this is a big, rich town, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
And I just come from the poorest part, oh woah
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I just happen to come up hard (Come up hard)
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

[A Boogie wit da Hoodie:]
Ha, watch how you move in my city
Ooh yeah, we kinda cool but we pity too, yeah
I know a killer, and he's feelin' [?]
If I tell him that it's up, then it's litty, ooh yeah
They tryna rob me for my shit (Ooh)
Hoodie messed up, I wish you would try to get through
Before I was rappin', I was like you hittin' licks too
Now I'm buyin' everything, like I'm too good for a rental
You act like you know everything, you don't know what I been through
Send my goonie to pull up on you, like Suge with the pistol
He might you up and spin your block wit your friend too
If you pull up on me and you movin' wild then it's litty
Know it's always on me, even when I sleep, it's under the pillow
They been plottin' on me since I was eighteen wearin' Kenzo
[?] OG's, Mike amiri got me official
They ain't want me when I wasn't hard to get to

[Trey Songz:]
They say this is a big, rich town, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
And I just come from the poorest part, oh woah
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I just happen to come up hard (Come up hard)
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it
