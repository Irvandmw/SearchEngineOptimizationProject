Lyrics:


Strange foreign beauty
I'll never know what's in your heart
Does anyone know how it feels to hold you
Does anyone know the secret of your mind

Strange foreign beauty
I'll never come to share your world
Does anyone know how it feels to live with you
does anyone know the secret of your life

Strange foreign beauty
You'll never know what I felt for you
Sometimes it feels like a million chances
Are slipping away disappearing in the air

(You'll) never know what I felt for you
you were always on my mind
(I'll) never know how it feels to hold you
how it feels to be with you
