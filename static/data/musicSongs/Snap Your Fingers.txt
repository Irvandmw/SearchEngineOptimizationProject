Lyrics:


(Snap your fingers) And I'll come running
(Back to you) On bended knees
Snap your fingers I will come running
I'll be true take a chance on me

Let your light turn green
Baby I got to know
Give me some kind of clue
Should I stay or go
Let me love you like a lover
That you used to know
Turn the key and let me in
To the same old door

I had it but lost it
Now I got a broken heart to mend
I don't care what the cost is
Got to find a way back in
So snap your fingers
Baby I'll come running
I'll do anything to get back again

I don't care what the cost is
Got to find a way back in
So snap your fingers
Baby I'll come running
I'll do anything to get back again
To come back again
(To get back again)
