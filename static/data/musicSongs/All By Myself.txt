Lyrics:


I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older all by myself

All by myself in the mornin'
All by myself in the night
I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there, playin' solitaire

All by myself, I get lonely
Watchin' the clock on the shelf
I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older all by myself

All by myself, I get lonely
Watchin' the clock on the shelf
I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older all by myself
