Lyrics:


I love you with everything thatâs in me
Did you know that?
Youâll be the first thatâs ever been so close
You should know that
Iâve been loving you since the beginning
For what itâs worth Iâve always been waiting for this moment

One special night for one special girl
Letâs make love like itâs our last day on Earth
With everything I am I promise it will be
Much sweeter than you ever could dream
Letâs do it tonight baby
Letâs do it for love

Never had a reason to believe that love would find me
It mustâve known something that I didnât know
And you showed me that if I had a chance to go to heaven
Girl Iâd stay here cause nothing could make me miss this moment

One special night for one special girl
Letâs make love like itâs our last day on Earth
With everything I am I promise it will be
Much sweeter than you ever could dream
Letâs do it tonight baby
Letâs do it for love

I canât think of any place Iâd rather be than here with you
When I hold you close to me feeling every bound of your heartbeat, baby
Itâs the way you look into my eyes
That lets me know just what you wish itâs for a night like this

One special night for one special girl
Letâs make love like itâs our last day on Earth
With everything I am I promise it will be
Much sweeter than you ever could dream
Letâs do it tonight baby
Letâs do it for love

Letâs do it tonight baby 
Letâs do it for love
