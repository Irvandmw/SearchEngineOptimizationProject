Lyrics:


It's 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up
I felt your foundation vibrate, a mountain might erupt
I've almost got you there so let me take you all the way
A taste to stimulate and keep you hot like

[Chorus:]
What (take it till you're high and low)
Like how (system overload)
Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)
And hit you with the real thing

What (rock you from the left to right)
Like how (electro paradise)
Like who (give you all the up you like)
And hit you with the real thing

Taste the divinity and mysteries surrounding you
Erotic stereo it's in the bass and trebble too
Throw both your hands above your head and let them levitate
And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop

[Chorus]
Like what (take it till you're high and low)
Like how (system overload)
Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)
And hit you with the real thing

What (rock you from the left to right)
Like how (electro paradise)
Like who (give you all the up you like)
And hit you with the real thing

Feed you more than enough
Ecstasy till you're insane
Hot adrenaline rush
Feel it running through your veins
And hit you with the real thing

(bring it till you're high and low)
(system overload)

I'm gonna show you how I'm rocking the boat
(rock you from the left to right)
(electro paradise)
I'm gonna hit you with the real thing

It's 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up
I felt your foundation vibrate, a mountain might erupt
Throw both your hands above your head and let them levitate
And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop

[Chorus]

Like what (take it till you're high and low)
Like how (system overload)
Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)
And hit you with the real thing

What (rock you from the left to right)
Like how (electro paradise)
Like who (give you all the up you like)
And hit you with the real thing

[Chorus]

Like what (take it till you're high and low)
Like how (system overload)
Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)
And hit you with the real thing

What (rock you from the left to right)
Like how (electro paradise)
Like who (give you all the up you like)
And hit you with the real thing
