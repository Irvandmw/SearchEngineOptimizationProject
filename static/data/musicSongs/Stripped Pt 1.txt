Lyrics:


Waited a long time for this feels right now
Allow me to introduce myself
Want you to come a little closer
I'd like you to get to know me a little better
Meet the real me

Sorry you can't define me
Sorry I break the mold
Sorry that I speak my mind
Sorry don't do what I'm told
Sorry if I don't fake it
Sorry I come too real
I will never hide what I really feel. No way, oh

So here it is
No hype, no glass, no pretense
Just me
Stripped
