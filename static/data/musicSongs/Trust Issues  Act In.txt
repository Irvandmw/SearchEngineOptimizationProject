["Trust Issues"]

[Chris Brown:]
I've been working late
You've been on my case
You wish I was better at communication (Ooh)
Lately, you've been telling me the truest statements
I find it hard to believe
That you love me and only me
I find it hard to see
I find it hard to see

It's gon' be hard for me to give you all of me (Yeah, yeah)
You hold it down for me, you get this crown for me (Woah-woah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't usually 'cause it's new to me
But I think, I'm feelin' you
Oh, but I, I got trust issues, trust issues, yeah, yeah

[Chris Brown & Sage The Gemini:]
He can't love you like I love you
He can't fuck you like I fuck you
Whoever it is, can't handle you (No)
Spendin' money ain't a thing
I do it, baby, on that Gucci purse
And them shoes
You know I've been checking for you
I know you're ready for your glow up
And start to act like nobody know you
Don't pick your phone up
It's gon' be too hard for me

[Chris Brown:]
It's gon' be hard for me to give you all of me (Yeah, yeah)
You hold it down for me, you get this crown for me (Woah-woah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't usually 'cause it's new to me
But I think, I'm feelin' you
Oh, but I got trust issues, trust issues, yeah, yeah

["Act In"]

I just want the truth, you won't hurt my feelings, no
Just tell me the truth, I'm not the only one you're dealin' with
I just want the truth, you won't hurt my feelings, no
Just tell me the truth, I'm not the only one you're dealin' with

Yeah, 'cause you ain't gotta act like you a good girl for me
No, you ain't gotta act like, you ain't gotta like that (Yeah)
And you ain't gotta act like a good girl, you a little freak
No, you ain't gotta act like, you ain't gotta like that

Five in the morning, that's when we be zoned in
Fucking up the headboard
Girl, that's what it's there for
Tonight, you're gonna act like you're my baby, but we know the truth
Tomorrow, you might be somewhere else with your other
Boo (Boo)
That's crazy
You spend time with him but I'm your baby
You know he ain't me (Know he ain't me)
You tell me I'm on your mind daily
Either way

I just want the truth, you won't my feelings, no
Just tell me the truth, I'm not the only one you're dealin' with
I just want the truth, you won't my feelings, no
Just tell me the truth, I'm not the only one you're dealin' with

Yeah, 'cause you ain't gotta act like you a good girl for me
No, you ain't gotta act like, you ain't gotta like that (Yeah)
And you ain't gotta act like a good girl, you a little freak
No, you ain't gotta act like, you ain't gotta like that

Roll it, boo'd up (Boo'd up)
This ain't new stuff
Poured a few cups
Go and move up
The way you ride it, throw them twos up (Ayy, ayy)
Need that girl to do somethin'

Five in the morning, that's when we be zoned in
Fucking up the headboard
Girl, that's what it's there for
Tonight, you're gonna act like you're my baby, but we know the truth
Tomorrow, you might be somewhere else with your other
Boo (I know)

Oh-oh
I, I, I know, no
