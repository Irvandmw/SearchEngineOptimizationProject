Lyrics:


And it goes like "Bang!"
And they're off and runnin'
Lookin' around like someone do somethin'
Scatter but it don't matter
I come gunnin'
So little time to squeeze all this fun in

Ah man, comin' at you now
Stupid enough to stand
We'll back you down
Like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What?

No, it can't be stopped
Break out ya little riot
Get it, call the cops
Call the SWAT team
Gimme all you got
The finger ready on the trigger
And we're callin' the shots

So, y'all really gonna brawl or not
My best bet's you probably gonna stall or stop
Got gall, my crew rocks, up into ya block
And when I sit back and put a hole in your chÃ¢teau, ha

We don't huff and puff
We'll turn your homeland and stuff
To a gust of dust
But I'm back act like enough's enough
Say a peep and I promise we'll fuck you up

Skip the rep for the sake of the family
I don't have to say a word
Y'all understand me
Stand up I'll put you back down flat
And we'll keep it likeâlikeâlike that!
