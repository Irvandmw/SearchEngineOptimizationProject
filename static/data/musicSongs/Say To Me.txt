Lyrics:


Hahaha

I-I-I-I-I ain't gotta talk, I don't wanna know her name (Name)
'Cause with all that there, I don't even see your face (Damn)
And she see all the zeros and commas, she know I'm paid (Yeah)
A freaky little thing, she givin' me brain
Look up at my chain, don't look at my face, yikes!

She got that booty delivery, let me pull up to your bumper
I'ma spend that whole life savings but no ho savin', I make a bitch roll up (Roll up)
I never go raw, never gon' roll the dice, put that thing on twice
A nigga never be a doorknob
Too busy livin' that fast life, that cash life
I see them lights in the donut
I put the bullshit off to the side (Off to the side)
P-P-Panties go with it (Down)
'Cause she got a real boss in her life (Boss in her life)
Had to come get her (Down)
24s on the muhfuckin' Rolls (Muhfuckin' Rolls)
White on white (White on white)
Le-Leave all them pussy niggas outside
A fuck nigga I don't like (Ow!)

All this money I'm makin'
It makes the niggas offended (Yeah!)
I put my bitches in Bentleys
And bought they mamas a kidney now
So what the fuck can you say to me? (Okay!)
Really, nigga, what can you say to me?
Look, ow!

This money, money, bet I count more hunnids, hunnids
Let the top, don't wanna smoke that loud in my backseat, no honies, honies
Motherfucker, I rip this shit, then kick this shit and punt it, punt it
Play with my dick, she for me, for me
Can't trace this shit, that funny money
My interior [?] and I am her receiver
She throw it back, I try to catch that shit
I slide down and I eat her
Baby should be riped up
But she striped up like Adidas
Three niggas in one week
I fuck her, but I don't keep her

All this money I'm makin'
It makes the niggas offended
I put my bitches in Bentleys
And bought they mamas a kidney now
So what the fuck can you say to me?
Really, nigga, what can you say to me?
Ow!
