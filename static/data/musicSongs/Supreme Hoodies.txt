I'm just tryna cop Supreme hoodies, (yuh)
Surely you know what I mean woadie, (yee)
If you need it come to me, to me, (aye)
I'm the best know what I mean homie, (yuh)
I'm just tryna cop Supreme hoodies, (yuh)
Surely you know what I mean woadie, (yee)
If you need it come to me, to me, (aye)
I'm the best know what I mean homie, (yuh)

I said don't talk on my name
Why is you fronting throw under your brain
'Cause we on that
Real niggas, know it's the same
Niggas switch up, 'cause, I switched the game
Tryna get money don't care bout the fame
'Cause feening for that swear these niggas is lame
Nothing put over my brothers just straight after fame
I set these niggas to flames
I'm just tryna get it, when the
Money come just spend it, put my
Brothers on to hit it, please stop
Asking if we with it, let us
Skirr skirr know we fit it, so we
Flexing now we get it, copping
Money as we fit it yah, (yuh, yee)

I'm just tryna cop Supreme hoodies, (yuh)
Surely you know what I mean woadie, (yee)
If you need it come to me, to me, (aye)
I'm the best know what I mean homie, (yuh)
I'm just tryna cop Supreme hoodies, (yuh)
Surely you know what I mean woadie, (yee)
If you need it come to me, to me, (aye)
I'm the best know what I mean homie, (yuh)

I'm tired of these niggas
They tryna act like I need them
Look how far I done came
Ain't nothing been the same, (no)
Always talk down on my name
Got me feeling that grind every day, (yuh)
You niggas don't know what to say, (no)
Don't matter I left anyway, (yuh)
Going back to back on some
Drake shit (what)
I ain't really 'bout it no
Fake shit, I
Really like switching up flows
Yeah nigga you know how it goes
Damn I hate them hoes
That's why I fuck 'em and go, (yuh)

I'm just tryna cop Supreme hoodies, (yuh)
Surely you know what I mean woadie, (yee)
If you need it come to me, to me, (aye)
I'm the best know what I mean homie, (yuh)
I'm just tryna cop Supreme hoodies, (yee)
Surely you know what I mean woadie, (yee)
If you need it come to me, to me, (aye)
I'm the best know what I mean homie, (yuh)
