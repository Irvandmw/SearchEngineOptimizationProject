Lyrics:


And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,
Jilly loves you more than you will know, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh bless you please, Mrs. Robinson, heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey; hey, hey, hey)

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our file
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you all you see are - sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you - feel at home

The PTA, Mrs. Robinson, won't OK the way you do your thing, ding, ding, ding
And you'll get yours, Mrs. Robinson, foolin' with that young stuff like you do
Boo, hoo, hoo; woo, woo, woo
So how's your bird, Mrs. Robinson, "Dandy", Mrs. Robinson you'd say
Hey, hey, hey
Well have you heard, Mrs. Robinson, mine is fine as wine, and I should know
Ho, ho, ho
