Lyrics:


My mother told me
Yes she told me
Iâd meet girls like you
She also told me stay away
Sheâll fall in love with you
And just the other day
I heard them talking in the halls
About the junk thatâs going around

Mommyâs all right
And daddyâs all right
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender, just donât give yourself away, away

Whatever happened to all this seasonâs losers of the year
And everytime I got to thinking, then they disappear
And then I come home, mom and dad are fucking on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling, and Cheap Trick's bouncing off the ceiling

Mommyâs all right
And daddyâs all right
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender, (yeah)

Mommyâs all right
And daddyâs all right
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender, just donât give yourself away, away yeah

Surrender, surrender, surrender
(mommys all right)
surrender, surrender
(daddys all right)
surrender, surrender

Mommyâs all right
And daddyâs all right
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender, just donât give yourself away, away

Mommyâs all right
And daddyâs all right
They just seem a little weird
Mommyâs all right
And daddyâs all right
They just seem a little weird
Mommyâs all right
And daddyâs all right
They just seem a little weird
Mommyâs all right
And daddyâs all right
Surrenderâ¦â¦
