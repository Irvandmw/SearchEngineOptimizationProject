Lyrics:


I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
And nobody's gonna bring me down today
Been feeling like nothing's been going my way lately
But I decided right here right now
That my outlook's gonna change

That's why I'm gonna say goodbye
To all the tears I've cried
Every time somebody hurt my pride
Feeling like they won't let me live life
And take the time to look at what is mine

I see every blessing so clearly
I thank God for what I got from above

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can say all they wanna say about me
But I'm gonna carry on I'mma keep on singing my song

I never wanna dwell on the pain again
There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then
Remembering too well the hell I felt
When I was running out of faith
Every step I'm about to take well it's towards a better day

'Cause I'm about to say farewell to every single lie
All the fears I've held too long inside
Every time I felt I could try
All the negativity I had inside

For too long I've been struggling, I couldn't go on
But now I've found I'm feeling strong and moving on

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can say all they wanna say about me
But I'm gonna carry on
I'mma keep on singing my song

Whoa, every time I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally so I ended up in misery
Wasn't able to see all the good around me
Wasted so much energy on what they thought of me
Than simply just remembering to breathe

I'm humanly unable to please
Everyone at the same time, so now I find
My peace of mind living one day at a time

In the end I answer to one God
It comes down to one love
'Til I get to heaven above

I have made the decision, never to give in
'Til the I day I die no matter what
I'm gonna carry on, I'mma keep on singing my song

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can do what they wanna, say what they wanna say
But I'm gonna keep on

I believe that they can take from me
But they can't take my inner peace

Say what they want to say
But I'm gonna sing my song
