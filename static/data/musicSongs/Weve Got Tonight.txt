Lyrics:


I like vanilla chicks and cocoa
Whether from over, sheâs a loco
I like em dancing on me slow mo
So come on fuck me like youâre supposed to
âCause youâre supposed to

[Bridge]
You know Iâm ready and Iâm good to go
So donât keep me hanging, keep me hanging

[Chorus]
Weâve got tonight, why are we waiting?
Ainât about us playing a game
Weâve got tonight, âcause tomorrow
Weâll be strangers all over again
You donât want my love, you just want my touch
Right now I see love
Do what you like
Can you take it?
We can do this into the night
We got tonight

[Verse]
I know you want me like I want you
So come talk to me like you want to
Iâm at the bar, why donât you come through?
Then we can start, I know you want to
I know you want to

[Bridge]
You know Iâm ready and Iâm good to go
So donât keep me hanging, keep me hanging

[Chorus]
Weâve got tonight, why are we waiting?
Ainât about us playing a game
Weâve got tonight, âcause tomorrow
Weâll be strangers all over again
You donât want my love, you just want my touch
Right now I see love
Do what you like
Can you take it?
We can do this into the night
We got tonight

[Verse]
Tonight I came out to rock the show
So get your fine assets on the flow
So come on baby girl just give me some more
The way you make me feel, I gotta let you know
So let me see you get low
I call her, she poke her, sheâs about to blow
Sheâs lookin so hot from head to toe
Youâre the pussy that gave his pack a boat

[Chorus]
Weâve got tonight, why are we waiting?
Ainât about us playing a game
Weâve got tonight, âcause tomorrow
Weâll be strangers all over again
You donât want my love, you just want my touch
Right now I see love
Do what you like
Can you take it?
We can do this into the night
We got tonight

We got tonight
We got tonight
