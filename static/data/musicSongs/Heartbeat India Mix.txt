Lyrics:


Hatila mann baavara
zara sa hai dara dara
Heart..Heart..Heartbeat
I saw you talking on the phone
I know that you are not alone
But you steal my heart away
Yeah..! you steal my heart away
Chori se mile kisi aur se
Dekha hai maine tujhe ghor se.
phir kyu mera dil churaate ho.
phir kyu mera dil churathe ho.
I donât know where we going
I donât know who we are
I can feel your heartbeat
Dil ne Kaha.
I can feel your heartbeat
Dil ne Kaha..
I can feel your heartbeat
haa...maine sunaa
Heartbeat...haa...maine sunaa
Heartbeat...haa..haa..
She said
hatilo aman baavara
She said to me
zara sa hai dara dara
She said to me
hatilo aman baavara
zara sa hai dara dara
Da..ni sa...
Da..ni sa...(I can feel you)
Da..ni Sa...(I can feel you)
Maybe itâs the way you move
You got me dreaming like a fool
That I can steal your heart away
I can steal your heart away
Tune samjahi nahi
Mera dil kilona na nahi
kyu mera dil churaate ho
phir kyu mera dil churaate ho..
Aa..aa...
I donât know where we going
I donât know who we are
I can feel your heartbeat
Dil ne Kaha..
I can feel your heartbeat
Dil ne Kaha..
I can feel your heartbeat
haa...mein ne sunaa
Heartbeat...feel your heartbeat
She said
hatilo aman baavara
She said to me
zara sa hai dara dara
She said to me
hatilo aman baavara
zara sa hai dara dara
I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your heartbeat
your heartbeat... She Said..
