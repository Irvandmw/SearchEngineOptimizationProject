Lyrics:


Feel the fire, let it go
Take it higher, lose control oh-ooh
Feel the fire, let it go
Take it higher, lose control oh-ooh
Comin' in...

Read my mind, open up
Faded I fall into you
Get me high on your touch
Tracing the outline of you

Don't let go now, no slowin down
I'm a fire and I'm burnin'
Comin' in hot, comin' in hot
No chill for me
Comin' in hot, comin' in hot
Red wine and weed

I want your touch
Come put your hands on me
I want my love to feed your vanity
Comin' in hot
Comin' in

Novacaine in my mouth
Tying my tongue like you do
Say my name, say it loud
Tell me what you wanna do

Don't let go now, no slowing down
I'm a fire and I'm burnin'
Comin' in hot, comin' in hot
No chill for me
Comin' in hot, comin' in hot
Red wine and weed

I want your touch
Come put your hands on me
I want my love to feed your vanity
Comin' in hot
Comin' in
Comin' in hot
Comin' in

Feel the fire, let it go
Take it higher, lose control oh-ooh
Feel the fire, let it go
Take it higher, lose control oh-ooh
Comin' in...
