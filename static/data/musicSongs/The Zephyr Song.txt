Lyrics:


Can I get your hand to write on
Just a piece of leg to bite on?
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash your light on?
Take a look it's on display for you
Coming down, no not today

Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up itâs on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Pickinâ up but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
Weâll find a place together
Fly on my wind

Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look it's on display for you
Cominâ down, no not today

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
Weâll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
Weâll find a place together

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa - do you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa - won't you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
Weâll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
Weâre gonna live forever
Forever
