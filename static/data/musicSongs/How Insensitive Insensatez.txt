Lyrics:


How insensitive... I must have seemed
When she told me that she loved me...
How unmoved an' cold... I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely...

Why... she must have asked
Do I just turn an' stare in icy silence? 
What was I to say...
What can you say when a love affair is over? 

[instrumental break]

Now, she's gone away

And I'm alone with a memory of her last look...
Vague an' drawn an' sad... I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look...

How... she must have asked
Could I just turn an' stare in icy silence? 
What was I to do...
What can one do when a love affair is over? 

What can you do
When a love affair is over? 

It's over...
