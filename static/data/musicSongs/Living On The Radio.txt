Lyrics:


Iâve got no friends
Iâm my own queen
But Iâm living on, living on the the radio
Thatâs my dream

Stone river eyes
And a lonely heart
If Iâm living on the radio
They wonât tear me apart

10 steps and roses on the tree
10 steps and lonely nights
But youâve still got me
On the road
Road paved in gold

Baby you must believe
Baby you must be free
Keep living on, living on the radio
Thatâs my dream

Baby youâve gotta friend
And so many little monsters, yeah
Keep living on, living on the radio
Thatâs your dream

And when thereâs nowhere to go
And your friends are gone
And you only got your daddy to call
It will be all right, honey
âCause your songs are on the radio

âCause the showbiz, all the caviar
The champagne and the sold out shows
But it will be all right honey
âCause your songs are on the radio
