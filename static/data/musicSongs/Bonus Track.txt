Lyrics:


I want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol whoâs pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over

Iâm a fly upon your neck
You canât control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need

Donât want your advice
Cos Iâve made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
Iâve heard it before
So donât try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol whoâs pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
Itâs no surprise
That youâd wanna waste your time

Iâm a fly upon your neck
You canât control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need
