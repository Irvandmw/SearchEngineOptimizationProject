Lyrics:


When I woke up in my bed
Opened my eyes this morning
I saw the heavy black side of my
Soul was creeping out the window
The happiness I felt disapperared again
Cos' there was someone knocking at my door
I guess it is the postman with a
lot of messages from the world outside

[Chorus:]
Keep all yor bills keep all your papers away from here
Leave me alone it is such a lovely day

Nomatter what you do in your life
You know you always have to sign
In a world where we were drowning in papers
It's difficult to hold the line
Newspaperspages always full of lies
Letters that make me cry
Sometimes I think that i've got enough
You better keep that stuff away from my side

[Chorus:]
Keep all yor bills keep all your papers away from here
Leave me alone it is such a lovely day
