Lyrics:


[The Weeknd:]
I just pretend that I'm in the dark, and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you

When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you

In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes, I know it hurts to smile but you try to
Oh, you try to

You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes, you lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

[Doja Cat:]
I never lied when I cried for you
And I know you cried, too (Know you cried, too)
You're really nice, just couldn't get now you're through
Always had to say, "Bye," to you (And I taught myself to say)
Love the way you're talkin', love your style but, ooh, babe
I know that you got it for me and it's R-E-D, too hard to see you
Hate the way I feel love, only hurts with real love
And he's taking every part of me, when you look, you can see love
One day, I'm giving you space
And the next day, you're giving me faces
And I like parties, not displaces
Comin' out of my bag for you to get wasted
(I can't stop staring at you)
It's like I forgot that staring is rude
And that's what five shots could turn me into
But you've done most things that gentlemens do, so

[The Weeknd:]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know (Let you know)
I'm ashamed of what I've done, yeah
When I look at you

In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see there's something burning inside you (Inside you)
Oh, inside you (Inside you)
In your eyes, I know it hurts to smile but you try to (Try to)
Oh, you try to (I try to, babe)

You always try to hide the pain (Oh, oh)
You always know just what to say (Yeah, yeah)
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes, you lie, but I don't let it define you (Oh)
Oh, define you
