Lyrics:


[Lady Gaga:]
I don't know what love is
If I can't have you here
I don't know what love is
I think that it's just fear

[Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:]
I don't know the tempo
Of my heart's concerto
It's all seems like a dream
It's not, I know
There's something real out there for me

I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue
(Every color I choose)
But I don't know what love is
And I think it might be you

[Bradley Cooper:]
If I have the courage
I know just what to do
Sometimes I have to crawl
And everyday I fall
Tryin' just to stand by you

[Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:]
I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue
(Every color I choose)
But I don't know what love is
And I think it might be you
