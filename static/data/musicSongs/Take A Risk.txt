Lyrics:


I must be stupid
Or I must be crazy, oh
Yeah, I must be useless to you
And I must be lovin' you lazy
Out my mind 'cause you're cryin'
You're sayin' I did this to you
Baby, I'm sick of this
Keep sayin' I ain't listenin'

Let it all out, tell me how you feel about me
Get it all off your chest
I get it now, you said enough to hurt me
You regret every moment you're in my presence
Day by day, step by step
Said I won't change to make it better
Don't wanna fight, since you stressin'
I'm free to leave all we have here
Everything we put together
All the power, you're a coward
My dear, it don't matter

'Cause you won't take a risk with me
You won't jump off the bridge with me (No, you won't)
You don't wanna live free-fallin'
No-no-no-no-no-no
Let go of my hand
You don't wanna fly, live with me
No-no-no-no-no-no
Let go
No-no-no-no-no-no
You don't wanna fly with me

You say I'm insecure
Think I ain't ready for you
I'll give a little more to you
But what will you give me for it?
Don't you knock it 'til you try it
You know I won't hurt you, baby
Ooh, just let it loose
That's right

Let it all out, tell me how you feel about me
Get it all off your chest
Scream it out loud, lay it all out for me
You regret every moment you're in my presence
Oh, day by day, step by step
If you want me, I'll make it better
It's your life, fuck this stressin'
I'm free to leave all we have here
Everything we put together
The perfect one I searched for right here
And baby, it don't get no better

'Cause you won't take a risk with me (Ooh)
You won't jump off the bridge with me (Ooh, no, you won't)
You don't wanna live free-fallin'
No-no-no-no-no-no (Ooh)
Let go of my hand
You don't wanna fly, live with me
No-no-no-no-no-no (No-no)
Let go
No-no-no-no-no-no
You don't wanna fly with me

If you can't hear me
I hope you feel me
I know you see me
You see me clearly
I know I don't have the answers to all your problems
But I'm willing to try to solve 'em
Baby, all you need is a little more lovin', oh yeah
Don't run from me, all this kissin' and huggin', oh yeah
It's just you and I, please be mine
Girl, forever
I'ma give my heart, just be kind
You never know 'til you try
Go ahead, go ahead (Go ahead)
Huh, just spread 'em for me now (Me now)
I don't mean your legs
Girl, it's time to let your wings out

'Cause you won't take a risk with me (Yeah)
You won't jump off the bridge with me (No, you won't)
You don't wanna live free-fallin'
No-no-no-no-no-no (No-no)
Let go of my hand (Ooh)
You don't wanna fly, live with me
No-no-no-no-no-no (No-no-no)
Let go
No-no-no-no-no-no
You don't wanna fly with me
'Cause you won't take a risk with me
You won't jump off the bridge with me (Hey, no, you won't)
You don't wanna live free-fallin'
No-no-no-no-no-no
Let go of my hand
You don't wanna fly, live with me
No-no-no-no-no-no (No-no)
Let go
No-no-no-no-no-no
You don't wanna fly with me
