Lyrics:


Oh, I'm packin' my grip and I'm leavin' today
'Cause I'm takin' a trip, California way
I'm gonna settle down and never more roam
And make the San Fernando Valley my home

I'll forget my sins, yes, yes, I'll be makin' new friends
Where the West begins and the sunset ends
'Cause I've decided where yours truly really oughta be
And it's the San Fernando Valley for me

I think that I'm safe in statin', she will be waitin'
When my lonely journey is done
And kindly old Reverend Thomas made us a promise
He will make the two of us one

So, I'm hittin' the trail to the cow country
You can forward my mail, care of R.F.D.
I'm gonna settle down and never more roam
And make the San Fernando Valley my home

I think that I'm safe in statin', she's gonna be waitin'
When my lonely journey is done
And kindly old Reverend Thomas made us a promise
He will make the two of us one

So, I'm hittin' the trail to the cow country
You can forward my mail, care of R.F.D.
I'm gonna settle down and never more roam
And make the San Fernando Valley my home

And make the San Fernando Valley my home
And make the San Fernando Valley my home
