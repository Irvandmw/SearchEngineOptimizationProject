Lyrics:


Yesterday, I finally had you
For a while, you were mine, all mine
Felt a deep, a deep connection
But then you left in a blink of an eye
Why

Do I have to worry
That you would never kiss me goodbye?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Why do I have to question
Your love and your devotion?
Why, why, why?

'Cause I
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love you

Yesterday, I finally had you
You touched my heart in a different way
It's too close to tell
If I'm under your spell
No, I can't, I cannot tell
And why

Do I have to worry
That you would never kiss me goodbye?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Why do I have to question
Your love and your devotion?
Why, why?

'Cause I
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love you

Are you listening
To a single word
Of what I said?
'Cause I love you
Do you love me too?
Baby, please, say it too

And do I have to question
Your love and your devotion?
Why, why?

'Cause I
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love you
