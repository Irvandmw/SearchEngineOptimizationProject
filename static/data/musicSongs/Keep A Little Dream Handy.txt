Lyrics:


Keep a little dream handy [JL] Tell me why and I'll try
For melancholy days [JL] Listen Arebella dream about another fella
Life's ice cream and candy [JL] Chorcafilla or vanilla
For dreamer so they say [JL] I'm no good at dreams I just fall asleep it seems
When a grape laughs keep a sun shining
UNINTELLIGIBLE

Keep that little dream handy [JL] You better had or I'll be mad
And dream your cares away [JL] Like Rip Van Winkle
And dream your cares away [JL] Say nighty-nighty
Dream your cares away [JL] It's time for bed now
Dream your cares away [JL] -- a dumb noise --
And dream your cares away
