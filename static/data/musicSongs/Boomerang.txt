Lyrics:


The fire was out
But then the phone rang
And all of the heat came back again
As much as I try
Your hard to resist
And all it takes is just one kiss
And I'm putty in your hands
I'm under your spell
You sent me spinning

You pull me in close
You throw me away
I keep coming back like a boomerang
You tell me to go
You beg me to stay
I keep coming back like a boomerang
Around around around back again
Around around around back again

You treated me like I'm your little toy
You tell me I'm not like other boys
And next thing I know you toss me aside
You don't even bother with goodbye
But when you say hello
I can't ignore you
You sent me spinning

You pull me in close
You throw me away
I keep coming back like a boomerang
You tell me to go
You beg me to stay
I keep coming back like a boomerang
Around around around back again
Around around around back again
Around around around back again
Around around around back again

Boom boom boom and now my heart is racing
Boom boom boom after you I'm chasing
Boom boom boom you got to catch me when I fall
You sent me spinning

You pull me in close
You throw me away
I keep coming back like a boomerang
You tell me to go
You beg me to stay
I keep coming back like a boomerang
Around around around back again
Around around around back again
Around around around back again
Around around around back again
