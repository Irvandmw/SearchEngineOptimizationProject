Lyrics:


What do you call it when you need him
What do you call it when you care for him uncontrollably
What do you call it when the doorbell can only mean one person

I call it love
I call it love

What do you call it when the earth shakes
What do you call it when your heart breaks to easily
What do you call it when your life seems to have a single purpose

I call it love
I call it love

Call it anything you like
My love would make demands
Let's share it while we can

Doing it all just so to please you
Singing the songs you like
And knowing I'm really needed here
Feeling the way I do I'm singing another song for you and

I call it love
I call it love

Da da da da da
Da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da

I call it love
I call it love

I call it love
I call it love
