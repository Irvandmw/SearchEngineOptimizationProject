Lyrics:


Don't get me wrong
Don't mind you shouting
Just think your style excludes
The part that really matters

Just grow tired
Of empty minds mouthing
English language courses
While they struggle with the a b c of hearts
the a b c of hearts, the a b c of hearts, the a b c of hearts

we'll stop in the middle just to talk about the part that really matters
cause I mean for all your style I just don't think your getting [?]
I just don't think your getting the idea, the idea, the idea

And I confess
That all I've learnt
Has been learn a million times
By every empty heart
That ever felt a song come home
felt a song come home, felt a song come home yeah, felt a song come home

But I'd be happy
When next I ask the time
If I find I've wasted none of mine
Listening while you wasted all of yours
you wasted all of yours, you wasted all of yours, you wasted all of yours

you wasted all of yours [X4]

But don't get me wrong
Don't mind you shouting
Just think your style excludes
The part that really matters

Don't get me wrong
Cuz I Don't mind you shouting
I Just think your style excludes The part
