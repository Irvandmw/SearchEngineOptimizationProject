Lyrics:


Every man that meets her wants 2 give her his name
Sheâs 2 hot 4 words & 2 wise 2 tame
Sheâs got knee-high boots & e-o-lectric hair
Born 2 b a rock star eye swear
Sheâs got 9 lives & a couple more 2 spare
Old enough 2 do ya
But 2 young 2 dare

She got a kick drum brain full oâ technology
But just enuff old school 2 know where the party b
Talks about the top as if sheâs always been there
A member of the "chosen few rarified heirs"
Her legs so long she never climbs stairs
Sheâs old enuff 2 do ya
But 2 young 2 dare

2 young 2 young 2 dare [x2]
(yeah)
2 young 2 young 2 dare [x2]

2 fine 4 idol
2 smart 4 the x-factor
internet beauty
everybody wanna hack her.
The world can only wonder right up until
They hear the juicy gossip thatâs in her will
Till then we can just pretend that sheâs

Old enuff 2 do ya [x3]
But sheâs just 2 young 2 dare
2 young 2 dare [x4]
