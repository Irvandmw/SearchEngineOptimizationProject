Lyrics:


[Intro - Future (Lil Wayne)]
Iâm lookinâ for her
Astronaut
(Tunechi)
Iâm lookinâ for her
Iâm lookinâ for her
(Remix)
Iâm lookinâ for her
Yeah

[Verse 1 - Future]
Is that her in the VIP line?
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Beamer
I donât want her cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loaner
Her old man the owner
And I donât even drink Coronaâs
What type of drink you want huh?
On champagne forever, on dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me if youâd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better, we can buy a crib wherever
Donât get too thirsty, get used to this cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see her âfore I do, tell her I wish that Iâve met her
Turn on the lights, Iâm lookinâ for her too
I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you
I heard she ainât gonâ cheat and she gonâ never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need her, she come through
Turn on the lights

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
This dick is for you
I ask her is it true and she say âlike a horseshoeâ
She got that nigga name covered, thatâs a war wound
She lay me on my back and ride this dick like vroooom
Then Iâ¦

[Hook - Future]
Turn on the lights, Iâm lookinâ for her
Iâm lookinâ for her, Iâm lookinâ for her
Turn on the lights
Iâm lookinâ for her, Iâm lookinâ for her
Iâm lookinâ for her, Iâm lookinâ for her

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Tell her I skate
And shawty down to earth, but bitch I need my space
And she gone ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum me anywhere you want, I give her Santa Claus face
We gonâ turn up tonight, that pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man, I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up like some Somalians
She know I got a girl, but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she donât ever ask about us
She just be like this pussy is for you
I say come and eat this bone, and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered, thatâs a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she fuck me like boom
Then Iâ¦

[Hook - Future]
Turn on the lights, Iâm lookinâ for her
Iâm lookinâ for her, Iâm lookinâ for her
Turn on the lights
Iâm lookinâ for her, Iâm lookinâ for her
Iâm lookinâ for her, Iâm lookinâ for her

[Outro - Lil Wayne]
Tell her I skate, I ainât go no worries
No Frank Ocean, Iâm straight
Tunechi
Tell âem Iâm straight, Tunechi

[Outro - Future]
Tell her I been lookinâ for her with a flashlight
You canât tell her, tell her nothing cause I got my cash right
And tell her if she honest, she promise to stay true
Make sure when you tell her, tell her we goinâ past the moon
Turn on the lights, Iâm lookinâ for her
