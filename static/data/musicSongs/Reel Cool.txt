Reel cool
Reel, reel cool

Hey there, weatherman
Whatâs your name?
Hey, hey
In this corporation
The predictionâs a high rollerâs game.

Put your hands together for the pony scene
Thereâs a boat with a sail and some real whip cream
Ladies on the winning team
Yeah, all the boys karaoke scream

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ooh ooh
Reel cool

Put your cute thing out of my flow, joke
Baby, watch yourself and the records and no
We donât mess around when it comes to being fabulous
We are reel cool
Keep it reel cool

Reel cool
Reel, reel cool
Reel cool
Reel cool
Reel cool
Reel cool

Put your hands together for the pony scene
Thereâs a boat with a sail and some real whip cream
Ladies on the winning team
Yeah, all the boys karaoke scream

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ooh ooh
Keep that shit reel cool

Put your cute thing out of my flow, joke
Baby, watch yourself and the records and no
We donât mess around when it comes to being fabulous
We are reel cool
Keep it reel cool

Hey there, weather guy
Whatâs your name?
Sheâs some kind of trouble,
Fuzz your hands and the smoking chain

Put your hands together for the pony scene
Thereâs a boat with a sail and some real whip cream
Ladies on the winning team
Yeah, all the boys karaoke scream

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ooh ooh
Keep that shit reel cool

Put your cute thing out of my flow, joke
Baby, watch yourself and the records and no
We donât mess around when it comes to being fabulous
We are reel cool
Keep it reel cool

Reel cool
Reel, reel cool
Reel cool
Reel cool
