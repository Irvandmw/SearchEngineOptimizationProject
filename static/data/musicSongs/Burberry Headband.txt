Lyrics:


Skrtt, skrtt
Skrtt, skrtt

Pulled up in a beamer, I was flexin'
Poured a cup of Wok, cause I was stressin'
After you, I'm fucking on your best friend
She love me, she see Burberry my headband
Put on all my ice now I feel so cool
You worry bout a nigga like a hoe do
I never chase a bitch I thought I told you
I just chase the money like I'm posed to

Pull up, I was flexing out a beamer
Prolly why you mad cause my shit cleaner
Running to the bands like a competer
Fuck her till the mornin' then I leave her
Don't address me you is a broke nigga, aye
I don't wanna see you at my show nigga
She wanna text me she must throw throat, aye
But first impress me bitch bring me dough, aye

Pulled up in a beamer, I was flexin'
Poured a cup of Wok, cause I was stressin'
After you, I'm fucking on your best friend
She love me, she see Burberry my headband
Put on all my ice now I feel so cool
You worry bout a nigga like a hoe do
I never chase a bitch I thought I told you
I just chase the money like I'm posed to

All these niggas asking how I do that
They say I been drippin', I been knew that
And when I say your name they asking who dat
And I just got a cheque and went and blew that
Lil baby why you lyin' you don't fuck wit me
You just want these bands that's why you stuck to me
I just got a 4 and I just poured the lean
I just cracked a wood and I just roll the gas

Pulled up in a beamer, I was flexin'
Poured a cup of Wok, cause I was stressin'
After you, I'm fucking on your best friend
She love me, she see Burberry my headband
Put on all my ice now I feel so cool
You worry bout a nigga like a hoe do
I never chase a bitch I thought I told you
I just chase the money like I'm posed to
