Lyrics:


The stary skies were clear the moon was shining bright
Was driving slowly through the night
Somehow I lost my way I started feeling weak
Pulled off the road to get some sleep

Then suddenly in front of me she was standing there
She called me in the night

[Chorus:]
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me she said

Her skin was velvet smooth her eyes looked almost ancient
And when we touched it felt so strange
She told med if I wanted to I could go with her
She moved me with her eyes

[Chorus:]
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me she said

We didn't do much talking no we didn't spoil the game
I only heard her say 

[Chorus:]
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me she said
