Lyrics:


[Future:]
I look the devil in his eyes just like the reaper
We start from that shit now we glidin' on it
I got a bag and cancelled my last ho
Got on 200 sittin' on the dashboard
You know them M&Ms we stash those
Brand new shoe laces for the transport
That double R truck nigga we waitin' on it
That double R truck nigga we waitin' on it

[Gucci Mane:]
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare and to diss me is risky
Future pourin' lean like its motherfuckin' whisky
I'm the type of rich they know I'm strapped but don't frisk me
Its 2016 I'm on my sixteenth Bentley
When I get a chance to vote I'm votin' for Monica Lewinsky
Cause I'm a paint her face like Leonardo Davinci
Ain't nothing special about you baby I ain't finna miss you
Let the next nigga hit you bitch I can't do nothin' with you
I'm the God of the trap so every verse is like a scripture
I'm picture perfect pay-per-view you still don't get the picture
I just want the cash don't need the gas not even a drop of liquor
I forgot your name forgot your face but won't forget to tip you

[Future:]
That double R truck nigga we waitin' on it
That double R truck nigga I'm waitin' on it
That Rolls Royce truck nigga I'm waitin' on it
That Rolls Royce truck nigga I'm waitin' on it

Used to run from the task cause I had the glass on me
Nigga talkin' all bad cause I got this stash on me
I'm a pour out this lean like Ace of Spade its on me
Used to see 'bout protections, lighten up I'm on fleek
I like my freaks neat I like my money neat
She gave me throat shawty couldn't had no teeth
I'm sittin' in a black Lamb' but my car pink
I did the [?] 10 Ms this week
Made a film now I got to eat
I got a dealership at the crib
I got prescriptions sitin' in my system
Percocets mollies they stayin' in my system
I got to pour up and pour for my mental
I got to fly in a private the general
Giorgio Armani I'm the first one to get it
Me and Guwop be the first one to get it

That double R truck nigga we waitin' on it
That double R truck nigga I'm waitin' on it
That Rolls Royce truck nigga I'm waitin' on it
That Rolls Royce truck nigga I'm waitin' on it

I got a bag and cancelled my last ho
Got on 200 sittin' on the dashboard
You know them M&Ms we stash those
Brand new shoe laces for the transport
That double R truck nigga we waitin' on it
That double R truck nigga we waitin' on it
