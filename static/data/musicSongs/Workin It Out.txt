Lyrics:


Some days I start off draggin' my feet
Some days I want to fly
Some days it all makes sense to me
Some days I just don't want to know why

[CHORUS:]
Hey, hey- I'm not giving up, no
Gonna stand up and shout it
Oh oh oh no way im not slackin off or backing out or cracking up with doubt
I'm workin' it out out
I'm workin' it out

Sometimes I'm just surrounded by friends
Sometimes we've never met
Sometimes I pray for something I need
But hey, you never know what you're gonna get
and

[CHORUS]

[Spoken:]
It's hard enough to be what you are
Harder to be what you're not
It's hard to know what you need to get
Harder to know what you've got

[CHORUS 2X]
