Lyrics:


Soft as a raindrop
Fresh as the sea
Warm as the sunshine
Shining on me
This is my love
This is my love
Light was her laughter
Few were her tears
Gentle her beauty
Tender her years
This is my love
This is my love
So young
So fair
Such bright golden hair
A smile always on her face
No other love
Can ever compare
No other can take her place
Others may cherish
Fortune or fame
I will forever
Cherish her name
For this is my love
This is my love
