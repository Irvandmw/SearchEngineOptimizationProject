Lyrics:


I got a problem with the snakes that are crawling
Through my area when the darkness has fallen
And momma told me that they love to bite
They stab you in the back, no shame that's right
What? What?
I keep my distance cause they're making me crazy
And stealing from me, you know those fuckers are lazy
My blood boils, fat turns to oil
Step the fuck back, or you'll get buried in soil
Over drama, or you could sleep with the fishes
My clutches are tight and I'll take your last wishes
One for the money, two for your girl
Three for your life, now I fucked up your world

Do you like how it feels?
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
I don't like how it feels, check it
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
Break it down

Yo, it's kinda funny how you're running your mouth, man
You're caught in a lie and there's no way out, come on
Betray your friends and your peeps and your family
Living like a snake, living like a bloody thief
Check my speech cause it's deep like the sea
From me to y'all and then from y'all back to me, ha
Danger, danger, I slay snakes like a ranger
Military style fears God, not a stranger
Now tell me, tell me whose crew sicker?
Mine's sicker
Get on your knees, you be a dick licker 
One for the money, two for your girl
Three for your life, now I fucked up your world

Do you like how it feels?
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
I don't like how it feels, check it
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill

Do you like how it feels?
I don't like how it feels
I don't like it
I don't want it
I don't need it
I don't like it
I don't want it
I don't need it
What the fuck is up?

Do you like how it feels?
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
Do you like how it feels?
I don't like how it feels
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
By the snake that kills
By the snake that kills
