Lyrics:


I just wanna show the world what I'm worth
Don't wanna be stuck like everybody else
I want more, more
I want more, more

You said, "I just wanna find my happiness"
That's why I work so hard, harder than the rest
I want more, more
I want more, more

For once, once in your life
For once push your ambitions aside
And instead of moving mountains
Let the mountains move you
For once, once in your life
For once just stop to open your eyes
And instead of moving mountains
Let the mountains move you

I just want them all to love me best
Cause maybe that would change how I feel about myself
I want more, more
I want more, more

For once, once in your life
For once push your ambitions aside
And instead of moving mountains
Let the mountains move you
For once, once in your life
For once just stop to open your eyes
And instead of moving mountains
Let the mountains move you

For once, once in your life
For once push your ambitions aside
And instead of moving mountains
Let the mountains move you
For once, once in your life
For once just stop to open your eyes
And instead of moving mountains
Let the mountains move you
