Lyrics:


If I ruled the world
Every day would be the first day of Spring
And every heart would have a new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring

If I ruled the world
Every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Why don't you take my word
We would treasure each day that occurred

My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
And my world would wear a smile on its face
Like the man in the moon has when the moon beams

If I ruled the world
Every man would say the world was his friend
There'd be so much happiness that no one could end
No, my friend
Not if I ruled the world
And every man would hold his head up high
There'd be sunshine in everybody's sky
If a day ever dawned that I...
If I had anything to do with it I think it should be
If I ruled the world
