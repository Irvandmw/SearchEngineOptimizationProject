Lyrics:


You always break a heart when you break a promise
I guess I didn't practice what I preach
I know not telling you was so dishonest
But honestly, the dishonesty was killing me

You asked a question and I lied
I think about it all the time
I was wrong to think I'm right
Playing God with you and I
But the truth always comes out
In the silence, it rings loud
Where there's smoke, there's a fire
Now I know what you see
When you look at me
I will always be a liar

And I know I wasn't doing all the right things
Thought what you didn't know could never hurt (So sorry 'bout it)
But when the words slipped out, it struck like lightning (Ooh)
Yeah, keeping it from you just made it worse
I don't know what to do (To do)
'Cause there's no wrong for you (Ooh)
And I can't hear your name without feeling ashamed
Afraid of losing you (Afraid of losing you)
And so I bend the truth (And so I bend the truth)
And it only happened once, but once was way too much, yeah

You asked a question and I lied
I think about it all the time
I was wrong to think I'm right
Playing God with you and I
But the truth always comes out
In the silence, it rings loud
Where there's smoke, there's a fire
Now I know what you see (Ah)
When you look at me
I will always be a liar

Yeah, I know what you see
When you look at me
I will always be a liar
Yeah, I know what you see
When you look at me
I will always be a liar
