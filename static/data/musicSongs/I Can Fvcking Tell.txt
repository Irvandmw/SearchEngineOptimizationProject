Lyrics:


I can fucking tell, you still love me still
Been through fucking Hell, riding on one way
I can fucking tell, you still love me still
They won't like my way, I say let...

I don't believe in the wedding bells, I don't believe in us
She don't believe in a fairy tale, she don't believe in God
I told the girl "When the summer chills, you get way too dark"
She stood there with a left hand on a gun, right hand on her heart
She don't believe in the antidote, she wanna feel the pain
And every night is a holiday, it all feels the same
I never die, never disappear, they're gonna know my name
We both know, when you're up this high only the ceilings change

I can fucking tell, you still love me still
Been through fucking Hell, riding on one way
I can fucking tell, you still love me still
Girl it never fails, you like "This time it's real"
I can fucking tell, you still love me still
We done been through Hell, ridin' on one way
I can fucking tell, you still love me still
They won't ride my wave, I say let 'em sail

In front of my mind you all night
Champagne, champagne in nights
We love fresh trims alright
'Cause I know high life, it's your time
And I'm just a simple guy from the street when the gun go off
I'm just a simple man from the dark with the sun go out
I just wanna' ride in a Porsche, with the top and the window off
'Cause I ain't never learned to play, deathbed or basketball

I can fucking tell, you still love me still
Been through fucking Hell, riding on one way
I can fucking tell, you still love me still
Girl it never fails, you like "This time it's real"
I can fucking tell, you still love me still
We done been through Hell, riding on one way
I can fucking tell, you still love me still
They won't ride my wave, I say let 'em sail
