Lyrics:


Just for a thrill
You changed the sunshine to rain
And just for a thrill
You filled my heart with so much pain

To me you were my pride and joy
Oh but to you I was merely a toy
A plaything, a plaything, a plaything
That you could toss around at will

And just for a thrill, a thrill, a thrill
You made my life, you made my life one sad song
And just for a thrill
You took me by the hand and you just led, you led me along

And although you're free I know you're having fun
Oh but to me and in my heart you'll still be the only one
Because you, oh you made my heart stand still, yeah
Just for your own personal thrill, thrill
