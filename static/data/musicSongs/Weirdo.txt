Lyrics:


I'm that girl talking to herself
In the corner of the room
She looks like she's from somewhere else
Like the dark side of the moon

Some people think that I'm a freak
But I think they're in denial
Cause the only thing they have that I don't is
A bullshit smile

You can say that I'm a zero
A super freak, a fucking weirdo
But I turn heads wherever I go
I'm proud to be a fucking weirdo
Weirdo
Weirdo

Happy faces all around and
I think that I might choke
I'm like a vampire on these sunny days
I feel my skin begin to smoke

Some people think that I'm a freak
But I think they're in denial
Cause the only thing they have that I don't is
A bullshit smile

You can say that I'm a zero
A super freak, a fucking weirdo
But I turn heads wherever I go
I'm proud to be a fucking weirdo
Weirdo
Weirdo

Weirdo
Weirdo
I'm proud to be a fucking weirdo

You can say that I'm a zero
A super freak, a fucking weirdo
But I turn heads wherever I go
I'm proud to be a fucking weirdo

You can say that I'm a zero
A super freak, a fucking weirdo
But I turn heads wherever I go
