Lyrics:


I rise, I fall with each little thing you do
You hurt, I hurt, I'm that much a part of you
And when you're happy, baby well I'm happy too
Since I'm that much... a part of you

I rise, I fall with each little breath you take
You cry, I cry, 'cause I feel the same heartache
And when you're smilin' baby, I smile too
Since I'm that much a part of you

Your lips are my lips
My heart is your heart
Never let us be further than
Just a breath apart

I rise, I fall with each little thing you do
You hurt, I hurt, I'm that much a part of you
Everything that you feel, baby, I feel it too
Since I'm that much a part of you

Everything that you feel, baby, I feel it too
Since I'm that much a part of you
A part of you
A part of you
A part of you
