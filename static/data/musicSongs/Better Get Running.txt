Lyrics:


It'll tear you up, it'll break you down
It'll spin your head 'round and 'round
Like a midnight thief in disguise
It will steal your soul right before your eyes
It'll make you lose sleep
When you're in deep
Oh, yes it will
It'll fool with a taste
But it's bittersweet like a candy coated pill

I said woah, oh, oh, oh
Better get running
Better get running
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Take it from me when I say
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Better get running
Better get running

Yeah
Our love's start coming
Better get running
Mmm

Well, I've done the dance, and I've paid the price
It cost me my heart, it cost me my pride

It'll make you lose sleep
When you're in deep
Oh, yes it will
It'll fool with a taste
But it's bittersweet like a candy coated pill

And I said woah, oh, oh, oh
Better get running
Better get running
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Take it from me when I say
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Better get running
Better get running

Yeah
Our love's start coming
Better get running
Mmm

Ooh
You better get, better get
Better get, get running
You better get, better get
Better get, get running
You better get, you better get
Better get, get running

Cause I said woah, oh, oh, oh
Better get running
Better get running
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Take it from me when I say
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Better get running
Better get running

Yeah
Our love's start coming
Better get running
Mmm
When love starts coming
Better get running
