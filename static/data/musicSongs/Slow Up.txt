Lyrics:


No I don't wanna hurt you, I won't continue no more
I cannot desert you, oh no
I would hate to see you walk out that door
Where do we stand? Girl, I don't know where we are (we are, we are)
Let's take one step back, girl you know I won't go too far, too far

Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Don't fall so fast
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Let's make this last
I wanna give you all of me
But if we rush it, it won't mean a thing, girl
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Don't fall so fast

And things just happen so quickly
The further that we get, girl the harder we fall
And when you're travelling with me
I know there's no stress at all
So many times in life we were so blind to see (to see, to see)
Just open up your eyes to see reality

Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Don't fall so fast
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Let's make this last
I wanna give you all of me
But if we rush it, it won't mean a thing, girl
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Snow up (slow up)
Don't fall so fast
