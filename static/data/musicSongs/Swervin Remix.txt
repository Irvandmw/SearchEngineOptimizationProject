[A Boogie wit da Hoodie (Skooly):]
Uh
Yeah
Oh, that's London On Da Track, run that shit back
(We got London On Da Track)

[A Boogie wit da Hoodie:]
Swervin'
How you look so perfect on your worst days?
Double C your purses, you deserve it
Niggas in your DM, they be thirsty (Thirsty), and in person
But you're curvin'
Curvy little body, love your surface (Surface)
Yeah, I'm all on your body, make you nervous
I like the way you keep up with your earnings
Yeah, it's okay, 'cause you swervin'

I fuck you from the back and leave you turnin' (Turnin')
The type to make you feel like I'm so worth it (Worth it)
Blame my ex, that bitch, she did me dirty (Did me dirty)
Had me fall in love and then she curved me
(on God, swear to God, I don't wanna leave you, no)
New Louboutin, you would think I'm bleedin' from my toes
Dick all inside of you, make you freeze, make you pose
I want you to get up on your knees and your toes
I see one of my enemies, they gon' freeze like they cold
I swear I ain't no killer, but test me if you want
You don't want my adrenaline rushin', leave me alone (Leave me alone)
So much shit up on my mind, I can't think, yeah
All my niggas rock designer like they scream (Grrat)
Got the AP covered, diamonds with baguettes, yeah
I thought everything was right, that's when you left, yeah

Swervin' (Swervin')
How you look so perfect on your worst days? (Worst days)
Double C your purses, you deserve it
Niggas in your DM, they be thirsty (Thirsty), and in person (Person)
But you're curvin'
Curvy little body, love your surface (Surface)
Yeah, I'm all on your body, make you nervous
I like the way you keep up with your earnings
Yeah, it's okay, you be swervin'

[Veysel:]
Veysy ist so magic, Brudi, ich bin viel zu Merlin
Deutsche Rapper groÃe Klappe, glaub mir, so wie Kermit
Zaza Motherfucker, excuse me for my German
Rolle mit der Limo, weil ich mittlerweile Sir bin
Ich fick' hundert Pussys, du nur eine Pussy â Sherman
Ich stÃ¼rm' deine Party und nehm' einfach mal dein Girl mit
Ach, was ich noch sagen wollte: Danke fÃ¼r den Bourbon
Drogen schmuggeln, meine Route besser als von Hermes
Treffpunkt ohne Telefone, sag mir, wenn du mehr willst
Ohne Lappen mit zweihundert, scheiÃ' auf das Verkehrsschild
Alles easy, weil die Olle neben mir pervers ist, pervers ist, p-p-pervers ist

[A Boogie wit da Hoodie:]
If a nigga wanna act out, MAC out
Back-up, man down
Forty, out yeah

Swervin' (Swervin')
How you look so perfect on your worst days? (Worst days)
Double C your purses, you deserve it
Niggas in your DM, they be thirsty (Thirsty), and in person (Person)
But you're curvin'
Curvy little body, love your surface (Surface)
Yeah, I'm all on your body, make you nervous
I like the way you keep up with your earnings
Yeah, it's okay, 'cause you swervin'

[A Boogie wit da Hoodie (Skooly):]
The way that I live my life is amazing
Back to back big bodies, no more dreams, yeah
So much shit up on my mind, I couldn't think, yeah
All my niggas rock designer like they scream, yeah
Got the AP covered, diamonds with baguettes, yeah
Say my name in your song and it's lit, yeah
Been waiting for a nigga like this, yeah
