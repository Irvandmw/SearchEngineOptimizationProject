Lyrics:


Airplane, airplane 
Put me to sleep again 
Take me away, off to a dream 
And then I'll fly so high across the sky 
Awake in a new place 
Where mistakes of my past are erased 

Don't drop me 
Don't stop me 
Just hold me 
So cozy 

Airplane, airplane 
Don't you go down today 
Take me away, off to a better place 
You know just where I'd like to go
Please get me there on time
Don't delay me from losing my mind 

Don't drop me 
Don't stop me 
Just hold me 

Airplane, airplane 
Don't you go down today 
Take me away, off to a better place 
You know just where I'd like to go
Please get me there real soon
I've important things that I must do
