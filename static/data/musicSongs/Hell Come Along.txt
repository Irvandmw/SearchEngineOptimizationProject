Lyrics:


You been good to me
But lately you leave much to be desired
I tried to make it work
I gave it all I had
But, baby, I'm just plain tired
Of trying to be a good woman to you
When all you wanna do is make the girl blue

He'll come along, yeah
It'll be Mr. Right for me
He'll come along, oh yeah
And love me so tenderly, yeah, yeah

I believe in love
And I also do believe in helping my man, hey!
But what I got to do
Just to stay with you
It's more than I can stand
And I'm pulling together
And I'm sure hot
I want a man who appreciates
Who I am and am not

He'll come along, oh yeah
With love in his heart for me
He'll come along, yeah
Love me so tenderly, yeah

You criticize and did so much
That I don't care
I got someone new who's doing you
Without love there
Well, you can't be everywhere

I know that I'm not apple pie
But I am the proof and the truth for you
It's your neglect
I need more respect
And your foot fits the shoe
I'm on the ground, you're left over here
From some other love
And you just could not make it work

He'll come along
With love in his heart for me
Yeah, he'll come along, yes, he will
And love me so tender, yeah

I'm waiting (waiting)
I'm waiting (waiting)
I'm waiting (waiting)
I'm waiting (waiting)
I'm waiting (waiting)
I'm sure waiting (waiting)
I'm waiting (waiting)
On you, baby
Oh yeah, I'm waiting
Oh yeah, I'm waiting
Oh yeah, sure 'nuff waiting
Oh yeah, I'm waiting, yeah

Oh yeah, I, I'm waiting
On you, sweet pie
I'm waiting, on you, baby
I'm waiting, on you, baby
I'm waiting, on you, boy
