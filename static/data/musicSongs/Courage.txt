Lyrics:


I'm walking uphill, both ways it hurts
I bury my heart here in this dirt
I hope it's a seed, I hope it works

I need to grow, here I could be
Closer to light, closer to me
Don't have to do this perfectly, yeah

Rain, it pours, rain, it pours
It's pouring on me
The rain it falls, rain it falls
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
We don't have to stay, stuck in the way

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm walking uphill, both ways it hurts
I bury my heart here in this dirt
I hope it's a seed, I hope it works

I need to grow, here I could be
Closer to light, closer to me
Don't have to do this perfectly

See I let the light in the darkest place
I let the sunshine, pain goes away
Nothing is permanent for me, yeah
Flowers they bloom and fade away
The beauty it happen inside me
Even if it's a memory, yeah

Rain, it pours, rain, it pours
It's pouring on me
The rain it falls, rain it falls
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
We don't have to stay, stuck in the way

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm walking uphill, both ways it hurts
I bury my heart here in this dirt
I hope it's a seed, I hope it works

I need to grow, here I could be
Closer to light, closer to me
Don't have to do this perfectly

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
