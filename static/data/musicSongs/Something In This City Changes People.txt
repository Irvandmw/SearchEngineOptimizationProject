Lyrics:


Maitre D's will seat me 
Knowing what I spend
They offend
So sad so sad
Smiling face greet me
Everyone's my friend
They pretend
So sad so sad
They see I am happy
With my lady
They're not satisfied
All their feelings died
Something in this city
Changes people
Makes them devil-eyed
My love she waits for me
When I'm far away
Counting days
So sad so sad
They all know our story
Still they try to play
Anyway
So sad so sad
Flashing cars and morning
Funny faces
Egos magnified
Quite unjustified
Something in this city
Changes people
Makes them devil-eyed
