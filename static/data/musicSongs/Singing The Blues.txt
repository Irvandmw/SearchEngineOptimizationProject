Lyrics:


Well I never felt more like singing the blues
'Cause I never thought I'd ever lose your love dear, why'd you do me this way
Well I never felt more like crying all night
'Cause everything's wrong, nothing is right without you
You got me singing the blues

Oh the moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
Nothing left for me to do but cry over you (Cry over you)
Well I never felt more like running away
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay without you
You got me singing the blues

You got me singing the blues

The moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone that I thought was mine
Nothing left for me to do but cry over you (Cry over you)
Well I never felt more like running away
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay without you
You got me singing the blues
Singing the blues
Singing the blues
