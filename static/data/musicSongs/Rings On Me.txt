Lyrics:


Fuck the prosecutor and the jury
Fuck the court, had a million dollars in jewelry
You need to treat me like a king
You shoulda fucked me like a king
You shoulda fucked me like a king
You shoulda fucked me like a king
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
You shoulda fucked me like a king

I'm taking ecstasy with high tea
I seen the devil when I went to sleep
The feds taking pics, that's my ID
'Cause I stashed me a brick in a car seat
Yeah, bitch go big like yeah, bitch get hit, like yeah
Yeah, bitch go big like yeah, bitch get hit, like yeah
Yeah, we don't buy one pair, nigga gon' buy ten pair
Yeah, drinkin' on Act that's rare, drinkin' on Act that's rare
Fuckin' them hoes like a bear, nigga gon' hit that bare
Yeah, I'ma put lamb in the trap, it gon' make me put a lamb in a trap
Yeah, nigga we shooting on sight, niggas gon' never play fair
Yeah, diamonds light up real clear, now everybody wanna stare
Yeah, sipping on tea in the Bent, and it look just like a mint
Yeah, outside white and red, outside white and red
Yeah, might've had a tickle last night, and I'm on first class flight
Yeah, all my homies got bills, all my homies got white
Yeah, bitch want new Chanel, all I gotta do is go swipe
Yeah, codeine all in my cup, 'cause I live a rockstar life

Yeah, and ain't go buy no bitch no ring (Ayy, ayy)
Unless I put them shits on me (Ayy, ayy)
I'm boutta put 'em all on me (Woah, ayy)
And ain't gon' buy the bitch the lean (Ayy, yeah)
And ain't gon' buy no more damn rings (No, no)
I'm boutta put 'em all on me (Yeah, yeah)
I'm boutta put them shits on me (Yeah)

I'm with the shits and you can see that (Yeah)
With the shits and you can see that

Ain't smoking on back with you, I turn my back on you (Yeah)
I spray this MAC on you, I weigh some Act on you (Yeah)
Two on the line, we drink it like it's jumbo juice (Yeah)
You bought a truck, now you gotta snatch the coupe (Yeah)
You tried to wife her, but she loving on the crew (Yeah)
She getting recycled, we gon' fuck her like she new (Yeah)
I told my dog we gotta get back in the stu' (Yeah)
We get more money, any other niggas prove (Yeah)
Man, fuck these hoes, we ain't got nothing left to prove (Yeah)
I got a pill if you tryna catch the groove (Yeah)
I put my trust in y'all, made sure I got the juice now
Made so much money, he gon' send your ass through school now
I had to go back to the jewel, I got the flu now
I had to go back to the jewel, I got the flu now

Fuck the prosecutor, yeah, fuck the jury
Fuck the court, had a million dollars in jewelry
Shoulda fucked me like a king (Yeah)
They need to treat me like a king (Yeah, yeah)

I fucked that bitch in new Supreme (Yeah, yeah)
I was the first to buy Supreme (Yeah, yeah)
I was the first to buy Celine (Yeah, yeah)
Look at my driveway, I got tracks
Even my side bitch, she got status
So I ain't shaking my behind, work that magic
Nigga, I'm claiming all my hoes on my taxes
Fucked her on a Percocet, she been in love from there, yeah
And if you selling Activis, I'll purchase your whole trap, yeah
See how they pimping your [?]
Money come in, the fastest growth
My cars and my thots, international
Came in this bitch on the Adderall
All of this money, my problems solved
It's the typical issues that need to be solved
Gave her the game, no round of applause
I didn't get not a text at all
How you expect me not to sign it all
When I live a life like Escobar
When I call the shots, they never got crossed
Opinion on me, when I go in the vault
Gave 'em that bait and they ate in the sauce
I gave 'em that bait and they ate in the sauce

Yeah, yeah, yeah
