Lyrics:


I Rock diamonds on my neck
Got diamonds on my records
Since sixteen, comin' down reppin' Texas
How you gonna neglect this?
You was just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie Craig

What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body
Actin like I'm nobody
You gon' make me call somebody

(Let's go little kitty kat)
I think it's time to go
(Let's go little kitty kat)
He don't want no more
(Let's go little kitty kat)
He better call Becky with the good hair
