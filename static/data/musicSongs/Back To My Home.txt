Lyrics:


Sunlight, moonlight
It's always open
If a time that passes by
Forward and forward
I'll keep on moving
To give me that reason why
And I won't forget
No, I'll keep going back
Back to my home

For all of these years
I've been waiting to leave
Where would I call my home?
And without your comfort
Without your love
How could I stand all alone
And I won't forget
No, I'll keep going back

But for now
I'll be gone again
I promise you, I promise you
That there
There will be no chafe again
I give you my word
That I'll always make it back
Home, back to my home
My home

But it's not, I can't leave him
For long
Wasting my time
Just feel so wrong
And I open my eyes
So I've realizes
That life's just not a song

But for now
I'll be gone again
I promise you
For now
I'll be gone again
I promise you, I promise you
That there
There will be no chafe again
I give him my word
That I'll always make it back
Back to my home
