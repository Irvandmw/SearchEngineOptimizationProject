Lyrics:


(Listen... shh... listen! There, it's playing again...  
Gringo's guitar playing songs of desire 
are sung by the haunted wind!) 

Down in Nualo, Laredo,  
on the border of ol' Mexico 
there's a legend they tell of a cowboy,  
a tall Texas drover named "Joe" 
but the braseros just call him "Gringo",  
the gringo who played the guitar 
to the Mexican girl that he loved so,  
'neath the misty Mexico star 

(Listen... shh... listen! There, it's playing again...  
Gringo's guitar playing songs of desire 
are sung by the haunted wind!) 

He sang of the day when they'd marry,  
when the round-up was over an' through 
and great were the plans for their wedding,  
and for dreams they dreamed would come true 
But he never came back from the round-up,  
a stampeding herd ran him down 
but, sometimes, strange and beautiful music  
of a guitar is heard through the town 

(Listen... shh... listen! There, it's playing again...  
Gringo's guitar playing songs of desire 
are sung by the haunted wind!)
