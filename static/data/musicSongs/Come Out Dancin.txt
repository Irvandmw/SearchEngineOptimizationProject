Lyrics:


Hey come out dancin'
Aw, come out dancin'
Instead of clappin' your hands and tappin' your feet
Come out dancin'

I wanna see some action around this gym
I wanna see every girl swing out with her him
Come out dancin' yeah let's go

Are the boys afraid of the girls?
(No)
Are the girls afraid of the boys?
(No)
Well when you hear the bell just give a yell and...

Aw, come out dancin'
Yeah come out dancin'
Instead of clappin' your hands and tappin' your feet
Come out dancin'

Hey you pretty girl come dance with me
The others will follow just you wait and see
Come out dancin', yeah let's go

Now everybody, shake yourselves loose
First your head, then your caboose
Listen to the beat, the beat of the drum and...

Aw, come out dancin'
Yeah come out dancin'
Instead of clappin' your hands and tappin' your feet
Come out dancin'

Now this ain't no time for self control
Show everybody that you got soul
Come out dancin', yeah let's go
Yeah let's go, (Come a, come out dancin')
Yeah let's go, (Come a, come out dancin')
Yeah let's go, (Come a, come out dancin')
