Lyrics:


Caroling, caroling, caroling, caroling, caroling
Caroling

Here we come a-caroling
Among the leaves so green
Here we come a wand'ring
So fair to be seen

Love and joy come to you
And a Merry Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God send you a Happy New Year

We are not daily beggars
Who beg from door to door
But we are neighbors' children
Whom you have seen before

Love and joy come to you
And a Merry Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God send you a Happy New Year

Love and joy come to you
And a Merry Christmas too
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God send you a Happy New Year

Caroling, caroling...
[repeat]
