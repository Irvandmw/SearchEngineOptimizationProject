Lyrics:
Lyrics:


If I had to swim a river
Or climb a mountain tall
I do anything you ask
Anything at all

No river
No mountain
Can keep us apart
Show me the way (Ooooo)
Show me the way, to your heart

I would gladly cross a desert
To prove my love is true
I would sail the stormy sea
Just to be with you

No desert
No storm
Can keep us apart
Show me the way (Ooooo, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Show me the way, to your heart

If you ask for a palace
I'll build you two
If you ask me for dew
I'll bring stardust to you
Only you

And, if all you're asking is love in all its care
I will pledge true love to you
Love beyond compare

My darling
I need you
Why must we be apart?
Show me the way (Ooooo)
Show me the way, to your heart
