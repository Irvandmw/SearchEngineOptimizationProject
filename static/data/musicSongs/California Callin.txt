Lyrics:


Driving through the night
Tears are running down my face
I start to realize, all the things that I once said
I promised you the world
It's nothing more than you deserve
It's killing me inside, to know I put you through this hell

Take away my heart
It doesn't wanna work no more
I never meant to make you cry

California calling 20 miles to go
And I don't, I don't know
Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?
No I don't, I don' t know
I don't know
No I don't know

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

No one on the road and it feels so cold outside
It's driving me insane, to know how much you hurt tonight
Take away my heart, it doesn't wanna work no more
I never meant to make you cry

[Instrumental]

California calling 20 miles to go
And I don't, I don't know
Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?
No I don't, I don't know
California calling 20 miles to go
And I don't, I don't know
I don't know
No I don't know

[Instrumental]

California calling 20 miles to go
And I don't, I don't know
Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?
I don't, I don't know
(California calling 20 miles to go)
I don't know
I don't know
(Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?)
And I don't know...Wooh

Gotta keep on moving on
Gotta keep on moving on
Gotta keep on moving on
California calling, California calling
Gotta keep on moving on
Gotta keep on moving on
Gotta keep on moving on
California calling, California calling
