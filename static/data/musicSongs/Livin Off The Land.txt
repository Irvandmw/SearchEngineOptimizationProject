Lyrics:


You have to be comfortable with yourself because that's all there is
You and nature
You think you got it all figured out, you know, the wilderness will figure some way to teach you a lesson
As I'm alone in the forest I'm in one with my surroundings and there's a lot of peace in that solitude
I obey my command...

(Living off the land...)

And I break my back
And I work all night
At times I do all their work too
It don't break my stride
I just keep moving forward
At times I wish there were two
So I have somebody else
That could help me help you

I'll be down, sometimes it's hard
To back up the bills on the credit card
She keeps on running to leave
If you don't get on your knees
And repay the money you spend
But like her trust, you cannot get lit
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you're tryna soul search

Singing I'm just one man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

Why you waste what you ain't got
On that power box
Has it not quite dawned on you
That don't work at all
See the easy thing to do
Is the hardest thing to do
You just open up yourself
So the truth could come through

I'll be down, sometimes it's hard
To back up the bills on the credit card
She keeps on running to leave
If you don't get on your knees
And repay the money you spend
But like her trust, you cannot get lit
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you're tryna soul search

Singing I'm just one man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land

I'll be down, sometimes it's hard
To back up the bills on the credit card
She keeps on running to leave
If you don't get on your knees
And repay the money you spend
But like her trust, you cannot get lit
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you're tryna soul search

Singing I'm just one man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land

I'm just one man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

If you just open up yourself (if you just open up yourself)
If you just open up yourself (if you just open up yourself)
If you just open up yourself, you'll see, that what you need
When you're living off the land
