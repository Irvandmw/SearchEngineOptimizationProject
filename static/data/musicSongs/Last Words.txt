Lyrics:


Dear loved one, please listen, this might be the last chance I get, I'm sorry I left you, I'm
living in a world of regret, don't cry if you can hear me, I never meant to hurt you dearly,
I'm so wrong sincerely, don't stop take life seriously.

These are the last words I'm ever gonna get to say to you, when everything falls away from you
take these words and know the world is not worth leaving .

There's so much I've done wrong, since I've left it hit me so strong, take my hand and let's
walk through all the times I've lied and hurt you, those people, please love them, don't hate
them, we're not above them, you can have everything but have nothing. Listen I've got to tell
you something..

These are the last words I'm ever gonna get to say to you, when everything falls away from you
take these words and know the world is not worth leaving. Last words I'll really get to say to
you, so listen very carefully to what I'm saying, life is more than just the games you're
playing.

if there was ever one thing I could ever get across to you, I'd tell you not to say these
things you do, and tell my mother that I love her too, no matter what life pulls ya through 
(No). You've got what it takes to make it through, and if I was you I'd get down on my knees
and pray. Thank God in the morning for another day. Cause these are the...

Last words I'm ever gonna get to say to you, when everything falls away from you take these
words and know the world is not worth leaving. Last words I'll ever get to say to you, so
listen very carefully to what I'm saying, life is more than just the games you're playing. Life
is more than just the games you're playing.
