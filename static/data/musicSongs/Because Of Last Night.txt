Lyrics:


Last night
I will always remember
How you held me so tight
I could see
You never want to let me go
And there you stood
Dressed in all of your splendor
I couldn't help but surrender
To you
I could see no other way

Not after last night
(Last night was a good night)
(Last night was a best night)
Not after last night
(Last night)
(Last night)
Not after last night
(Last night was a good night)
Oh, babe
(Last night was a best night)
Oh, darling
(Last night)
Believe me
(Last night)

Last night
Our whole world came unraveled
Now there's no way I'd ever
No, girl
Give my heart to someone else
And your smile
Your smile
Was so sweet and so gentle
I bet you knew I'd surrender
To you
Ooh, forever and always

Because of last night
(Last night was a good night)
(Last night was a best night)
Because of last night
(Last night)
(Last night)
Because of last night
(Last night was a good night)
Oh, baby
(Last night was a best night)
My darling
(Last night)
My lady
(Last night)
Oh-ooh
(Last night was a good night)
(Last night)

Last night
We really did talk a lot
We talked
Last
Fixed all that's been going on
But not a single word
Can compare
To the joy you've given me
Girl, you made me see
Certain I'm all wrong
I'm all for you

All night, all night, all night
Being wrapped up in your arms
While the room reeked of your charm
I could see
Oh, that I was yours for life
And there was I
Girl, after all of that spendor
What could I do but surrender
To you
God knows forever and always

Not after last night
(Last night was a good night)
(Last night was a best night)
Not after last night
(Last night)
(Last night)
Not after last night
(Last night was a good night)
Oh, baby
(Last night was a best night)
My darling
(Last night)
Believe me
(Last night)
Because of last night
(Last night was a good night)
(Last night was a best night)
Oh-oh, last night
(Last night)
(Last night)
Because of last night
(Last night was a good night)
I said, my baby
(Last night was a best night)
I said, my darling
(Last night)
I said, my lady
(Last night)
Because of last night
(Last night was a good night)
(Last night was a best night)
(Last night)
(Last night)
Oh, what a night
(Last night was a good night)
Oh, baby
(Last night was a best night)
(Last night)
My darling
(Last night)
