Lyrics:


Hi, I'm Dave
I'm Strange (no)
I've been up so long
Don't know where ill go don't know what I know I'm wrong
I must be gone (gone) I must be gone (gone)
I'll play my god

What you doing?
Like everything
Don't shoot down my pair of wings
Let me just smoke my Mary Jane
Ill just hold my marriage in
And that coin flip so damn american
Ever take a walk in the street
Sit up in the middle of the median
And they come and go and they come and go
And my shit been bumpin' my shit been dope
But I'm missing something I'm kissing hoes
And I'm missing something I'm switching rolls
And I'm pissed at something I'm drifting slow
I got zip files
And I know if I click them they gonna unlock
How do I know that though I wasn't taught
I guess that shit that you learn on the job
And my permanent fog is burning like smog
Look at your feet totally odd
What is a feat what is a job
Look at my teeth and they been moving a bit
So as of late I've got in my retainer but dawg
Sooner or later the pain is a problem
Only its not only its not
That mean its working I guess I'm like god

[Hook:]
I don't ever front out here for a minute (go crazy)
[?]
Oh my god oh my god
I can't even stop this song
Now the kid been getting bananas
He going Donkey Kong
(King of the ape shit)
He going Donkey Kong
(King of the ape shit)

I earned shit while he learned quick
Churned shit while he cursed this
And I turned around like I heard something
But i swear to god I ain't heard nothing
I second guessed you but escalated
Shit ready when I'm done renovating
Don't fuck with me on my escapade
Don't fuck with me on my escapade
And I met a boy on that mountain top
And he said to me go round the block
And I did that and I came back and he took back what I took back
I stood back while he took that
And I looked back while he looked at me
And that's when I knew I was on
Shouldn't be long
I keep it moving along
I keep on proving you wrong
I keep on doing the shit that you want me to do
It don't have to be public at all
It will be our little secrete
Unless you do songs about it
Hmm but why would you do that?
Well...

[Hook:]
I don't ever front out here for a minute (go crazy)
[?]
Oh my god oh my god
I can't even stop this song
Now the kid been getting bananas
He going Donkey Kong
(King of the ape shit)
He going Donkey Kong
(King of the ape shit)
