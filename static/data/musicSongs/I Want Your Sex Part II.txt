Lyrics:


Oh so much love, that you've never seen
Let's make love, put your trust in me (hmm)
Don't you listen to what they told you
Because I love you, let me hold you

Oh, I'm not your brother
I'm not your father
Oh will you ever change your mind?
I'm a gentle lover with a heart of gold
But baby you've been so unkindâ¦oh

Come on
I want your sex
Come on, I want your sex
That's right, all night
Oh, I want your sex
I want yourâ¦sex

Sexy baby's (Sexy baby's)
Sexy body (Sexy body)
Keeps me guessing (Keeps me guessing)
With a promise (Oh)
I know we can come together
But the question is Will we ever ever?

Sexy baby's (Sexy baby's)
Sexy body (Sexy body)
Keeps me guessing (Keeps me guessing)
With a promise (Oh)
I know we can come together
But the question is will we ever ever?

Ohhh together
You and me

I want your love
