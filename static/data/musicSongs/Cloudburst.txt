Lyrics:


Wake up! there's a new day dawning
think I'll take a walk for a while
I need shades cos the sun is shining
And I can see for miles and miles
I can feel the earth beneath me
I lie down we are as one
And they look but they cannot find me
Coz I'm off heading for the sun 

But it's getting colder
I feel a chill in the air
There's a change in the weather
Here it comes again
I can feel the rain 

The wind that brings on the change
Is making me older
The wind that brings on the rain
Is taking me over 

Downtown a moon is shining
I'm gonna dress up in style
And my business everybody's minding
I need to get away for a while 

But it's getting colder
I feel a chill in the air
There's a change in the weather
Here it comes again
I can feel the rain 

The wind that brings on the change
Is making me older
The wind that brings on the rain
Is taking me over
