Lyrics:


I'm drinking champagne and feeling no pain till early morning
Dining and dancing with every pretty girl I can find
And I'm having a fling with a pretty young thing till early morning
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

Guilty conscience I guess though I must confess
I never loved you much when you were mine

So I'll keep drinking champagne feeling no pain till early morning
Dining and dancing with every pretty girl I can find
I'll keep having a fling with a pretty young thing till early morning
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

I'll keep drinking champagne feeling no pain till early morning
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind
(I'll keep drinking champagne feeling no pain till early morning)
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind
