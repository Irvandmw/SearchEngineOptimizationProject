Lyrics:


Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

You're dripping like a saturated sunlight
You're spilling like an overflowing sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now I'm tearing through the pages and the ink

Everything was blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And makes me blue
And makes me blue

Everything was grey
His hair, his smokes, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
Doesn't know what it means
And makes me blue
And makes me blue

You were a vision in the morning when the lights came through
I know I've only feel religion when I'm lying with you
You said you'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

You're dripping like a saturated sunlight
You're spilling like an overflowing sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now I'm tearing through the pages and the ink

Everything was blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Torn apart at the seams
And makes me blue
And makes me blue

Everything was grey
His hair, his smokes, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
Doesn't know what it means
And makes me blue
And makes me blue

Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue

You were red and you liked me because I was blue
You touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky
And you decided purple just wasn't for you

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Torn apart at the seams
And makes me blue
And makes me blue

Everything is grey
His hair, his smokes, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
Doesn't know what it means
And makes me blue
And makes me blue

Everything was blue [2x]
