Lyrics:


[Lana Del Rey:]
Hey, what you doing?
Not a lot
Shaking and moving
At my local spot
Baby don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
(Why, why, why, why, why, why, why)

Lay, Lady, lay
On the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way
You would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on a park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me out there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Sean Lennon:]
Hey, what you thinking?
Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinking
On that old jukebox
But don't ask me why
Just swallow some wine
(Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine)

Stay, baby, stay
On the side of paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way
You would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

[Sean Lennon & Lana Del Rey:]
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on a park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me out there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And every day felt like some day and I
I wish we had stayed home
[Lana Del Rey:]
And I could put on the radio
To our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko
We would play all day long
Isn't life crazy, I said
Now that I'm singing with Sean
Whoa, oh oh

[Sean Lennon & Lana Del Rey:]
I could keep waiting for you
In that spot we'd always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pouring rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd loved me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came
No, no, no
Tomorrow never came
No, no
Tomorrow never came
No, no, no
Tomorrow never came
