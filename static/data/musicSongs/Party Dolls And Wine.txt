Lyrics:


Neon lights barroom bands hotel rooms one night stands
When it's party time you'll find me at the head of the line
Midnight cowboy singing his song to every girl who comes along
My life's made up of party dolls and wine

Party dolls and wine yeah drink and let the good times roll
Party dolls and wine making mem'ries for the days when I grow old

They say that someday I'll meet my match but until that time down the hatch
With that bubbling sparkling tantalizing fruit of the vine
I know someday I'll be put in my place but I'll die happy with a smile on my face
Remembering all those party dolls and wine

Party dolls and wine yeah drink and let the good times roll...

Midnight cowboy singing his song to every girl who comes along
My life's made up of party dolls and wine

Party dolls and wine yeah drink and let the good times roll...
Party dolls and wine yeah drink and let the good times roll...
