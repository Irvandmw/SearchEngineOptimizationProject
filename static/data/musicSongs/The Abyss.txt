Lyrics:


I can feel the energy
That changes in my chemistry
The atmosphere, the way I breathe
My automatic action is
To close my eyes and wander in
And wait until the madness ends
Lost communication with the world outside
I fall into my own, into the abyss

Lost inside my head, I open up the door
Step right off the ledge, into the abyss
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say
Am I already dead, into the abyss

Looking through distorted eyes
A mirror that I can't recognize
No way out, no exit signs
I try to make myself believe
I'm only in a lucid dream
It's like another world exists
I wanna go back into the abyss

Lost inside my head, I open up the door
Step right off the ledge, into the abyss
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say
Am I already dead, into the abyss

Lost communication with the world outside
So much devastation in my world I hide
I fall into my own, into the abyss

Lost inside my head, cracks across the floor
Step right off the ledge

Into the abyss
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say
Am I already dead, into the abyss
