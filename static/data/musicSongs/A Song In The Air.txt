Lyrics:


There's a song in the air
But the fair signorina really doesn't care
For that song in the air

So I'll sing to the mule
If you're sure she won't think that I am just a fool
Serenading a mule

And try as she may in a voice is a flower
All the lady can say
(JL) unintelligible
(Both) You're the one for me
