Lyrics:


I want you, won't you come and shape me?
You know what I'm addicted to
No needle in the vein could change me
'Cause I'm a junkie for you

Love junkie
Love junkie, yeah

I need you so bad, I taste it
I'd do anything you want me to
I'll use you up, take it all to save me
'Cause I'm just a junkie for you

Love junkie
Love junkie
Love junkie
You know, and I know we're love junkie's

Now you're crawling all across my pillow
I can hear it in the way you breathe
You push me up, up against the window
'Cause you're just a junkie for me

Love junkie
Love junkie
Love junkie
You know, and I know we're love junkies

Low to high, high to low
Ride around we go
It's always one more
Always one more
[x2]

Love junkie
Love junkie
Love junkie
You know, and I know we're love junkies
[x2]
