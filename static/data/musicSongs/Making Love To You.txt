Lyrics:


I'd love to spend my whole life through, 
Makin' love to you! 
It's just the nicest thing I do, 
Makin' love to you! 

Each time we're face to face, 
Music fills the air! 
And then when we embrace, 
I hear violins, the song begins! 

I never dreamed that you could be, 
Makin' love to me! 
That dream is now reality, 
You are here with me! 
Each night the miracle of rainbows come in view, 
Because I'm makin' love to you! 

I never dreamed that you could be, 
Makin' love to me! 
That dream is now reality, 
âCause you are here with me! 

Each night the miracle of rainbows come in view, 
Because I'm makin' love to you!
