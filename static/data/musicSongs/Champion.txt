Yeah, yeah
Wait a minute, who are you? (Ayy, yo, K.I.D.)
Let's go (Woo)

Yeah, I took the cash route
I put in more time, more grind, no lyin'
I didn't take the fast route (Let's go)
Suck it up, no cryin', no cryin', no cryin'
I didn't ask for handouts (Yeah)
Go to work, no grind, no shine, no shine
And that's how you stand out (Yeah)
Yeah, that's how I stand out (Yeah)
Yeah, I took the cash route
I put in more time, more grind, no lyin' (Let's go)
I didn't take the fast route
Suck it up, no cryin', no cryin', no cryin'
I didn't ask for handouts (Uh-uh)
Go to work, no grind, no shine, no shine (Yeah)
And that's how you stand out
Yeah, that's how I stand out (Let's go)

Yeah, I took the cash route
I did it and did it again (What you did?)
I started at one and I went up to ten
Came back, now I'm winning again (Uh-huh)
We pull up behind tints, which one he gon' hop out? (Skrrt)
They don't know what whip that he in (Vroom)
Put in hours of practice and that's how it happened
I don't even pick up a pen
Nah, I'm comin' straight up off the top with it (Let's go)
Ain't a power forward, he ain't a center, but he was on the block with me
Shootin' in the gym, we really got it in, he put up the shots with me (Uh-huh)
Now we breakin' bread, everybody playin', he hold up a knot with me (No cap)
We took the cash route (Let's go)
Yeah, I'm talkin' mula, fetty (Uh-huh)
We grew up off of noodles, spaghetti
Used to be peanut butter and jelly (Uh-huh)
Now the Chevy gon' come when it's ready (Uh-huh)
What you know 'bout the lights off, candles? (Lights)
I provide with the mic off dancin' (Like Mike)
I'm a star and I'm moonwalkin'
Now I got the whole room talkin'
Yeah, I'm talkin' trophies
I got everybody talkin' down, actin' like they know me
I'm a champion like LeBron, ballin' with my homies
I'm better than the old me
R.I.P. to Kobe, yeah

Yeah, I took the cash route (Let's go)
Put in more time, more grind, no lyin'
I didn't take the fast route (Let's go)
Suck it up, no cryin', no cryin', no cryin'
I didn't ask for handouts (Yeah)
Go to work, no grind, no shine, no shine
And that's how you stand out (Yeah)
Yeah, that's how I stand out (Uh-huh)
Yeah, I took the cash route (Let's go)
I put in more time, more grind, no lyin'
I didn't take the fast route (Uh-huh)
Suck it up, no cryin', no cryin', no cryin'
I didn't ask for handouts (Uh-huh)
Go to work, no grind, no shine, no shine (Yeah)
And that's how you stand out (Yeah)
Yeah, that's how I stand out (Let's go)

Yeah
Yeah
Uh-huh
