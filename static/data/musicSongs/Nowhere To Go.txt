Lyrics:


[Nick:]
Looking for beauty in a certain 
Finding the strength inside a gray 
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown 
And maybe that's ok 
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life 
Maybe I need to get a grip 
Cause you're the only one 
That makes me feel like this 
So...

[Chorus:]
Save me I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 
In the end no matter what I do 
There's nowhere, nowhere to go 

[Brian:]
Nowhere to go but you

Tryin' to make nothing out of something 
Promise myself I wouldn't care 
Maybe you're making me a liar cause I'm sitting here 
You finally crackin' my resistance 
And find a way to wear me down 

[Howie:]
Yea, I just look at you 
And there's no way out 

[AJ/All:]
Every single road I take (it's you) 
Asleep or wide awake (I know it's you) 
And it's too late for anyone to save me 

[Brian:]
I'm falling again 
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces 

[Repeat Chorus 2x:]
[Howie:]
Nowhere to go but you
