Lyrics:


Folks will taking advantage of you 
because they believe youâre too weak to speak up for yourself
You donât have to speak up for yourself
Be still and let God fight your battles

[Verse 1:]
There will be mountains that I will have to climb
And there will be battles that I will have to fight
But victory or defeat, it's up to me to decide
But how can I expect to win if I never try?

[Chorus:]
I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He brought me this far to leave me

[Verse 2:]
Never said there wouldn't be trials
Never said I wouldn't fall
Never said that everything would go
The way I want it to go
But when my back is against the wall
And I feel all hope is gone
I'll just lift my head up to the sky
And say, âHelp me to be strongâ

[Chorus:]
I just can't give up now
I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He brought me this far to leave me

[Bridge:]
No you didn't bring me out here to leave me lonely
Even when I can't see clearly
I know that you are with me, so I canâtâ¦

[Chorus:]
I just can't give up now
Cause I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me that the road would be easy
And I don't believe He brought me this far to leave me
