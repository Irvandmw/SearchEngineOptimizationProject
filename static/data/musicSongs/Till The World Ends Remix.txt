[Britney Spears:]
Till The World Ends (Remix)

[Nicki Minaj:]
Chimpanzees is hatin', but I take it all in stride
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side
Told you they'd revive your career but somebody lied
I ain't talking poultry when I say this chicken's fried

Anyway, Britney
Why they so jealous that you teamed up with me?
Tell 'em they my son. Yup, gyal 'em a mi pickney
Anyway, brembedell
What's that? I don't know. Femme Fatale

Sniff, sniff, cries
I done slayed your whole entire fucking life
You got some Epsom Salt
I done balled all day you ain't touched the court

What? What you tired? You need a break?
You was hot when? Ricki Lake!

[Britney Spears:]
I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it
To the next level, baby
If you want this good shit
This is the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

[Nicki Minaj:]
It's Britney bitch. I'm Nicki Minaj, and that's Kesha!

[Ke$ha:]
I can't take itâtake itâtake no more
Never felt likeâfelt like this before
Come on get meâget me on the floor
DJ, what youâwhat you waitin' for?

[Britney Spears:]
Watch me move when I loseâwhen I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark

You notice what I'm wearin'
I'm noticin' you're starin'
You know that I can take it
To the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list
Next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight!

[Ke$ha:]
I can't take itâtake itâtake no more
Never felt likeâfelt like this before
Come on get meâget me on the floor
DJ, what youâwhat you waitin' for?

See the sunlight
We ain't stoppin'
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends

Keep on dancing 'til the world ends
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends

See the sunlight
We ain't stoppin'
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends
