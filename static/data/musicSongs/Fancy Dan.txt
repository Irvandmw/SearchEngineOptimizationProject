Lyrics:


I wanna hit the streets, spend some cold nights in an alley way
I'm gonna get ya fancy Dan
I wanna chase your tail to the county jail, with some Tijuana mama
I'm gonna get ya fancy Dan

I'm no main woman and you like a fear
I ain't no cheap thriller fancy Dan man steel
And you can't escape from the hook I have in you

It's gonna be hard to keep your shirt on
You don't stand a chance because you're hot

Guaranteed satisfaction, I'm gonna get ya fancy Dan man
Guaranteed satisfaction, I'm gonna get ya fancy Dan

Go on and read the deal, tell them stories in the slammer
I'm gonna get ya, fancy Dan

Now when they cut you loose, and you're out of juice
With your downtown lady
I'm gonna get ya, fancy Dan

I'm no main woman and you like a fear
I ain't no cheap thriller fancy Dan man steel
And you can't escape from the hook I have in you

It's gonna be hard to keep your mind on
And to be romance because your hot

Guaranteed satisfaction, I'm gonna get ya fancy Dan
Guaranteed satisfaction, I'm gonna get ya fancy Dan
Guaranteed satisfaction, I'm gonna get ya fancy Dan
