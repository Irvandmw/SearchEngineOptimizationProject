Lyrics:


I can't say that you don't hurt me anymore
I haven't changed enough to make me think I'm what you're looking for
And I can't be the fix for what you're going through
Maybe I'm not the same me, but you're still the same you

So you don't get to know what I do with my time
You don't get to say you ain't doing alright
You don't get to come around saying that you want me now
You don't get to show up with that look in your eyes
You don't get to think that you can take it all back
You don't get to miss what you said we never had
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn
After all you put me through no, you don't get to
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to
Did you come back 'cause I didn't break enough?
Did you hear that I was happy? You just had to mess it up
Or is it just some phase you're always going through?
To want what you can't have and leave it when you do

So you don't get to know what I do with my time
You don't get to say you ain't doing alright
You don't get to come around saying that you want me now
You don't get to show up with that look in your eyes
You don't get to think that you can take it all back
You don't get to miss what you said we never had
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn
After all you put me through no, you don't get to
You don't, you don't, you don't
You don't get to

You don't get to kiss me and make it all better
You don't get to lay it all out in a letter
Blame it on something, break me like it's nothing
Just to love me back together
You don't get to show up with your hair hanging down
Move a little closer like you're moving right now
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn
After all you put me through no, you don't get to
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to
You don't get to
You don't get to
