Lyrics:
Lyrics:


And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
Iâll hold on and hold on

I keep listening to my chest
For a beat but thereâs nothing left
Itâs been a week since Iâve seen you
And I still canât believe it
'Cause Iâm dying inside alone
And every day we gotta be apart
Iâm like a baby with a broken heart
But the second that I'll see you
You will know how much I need you
Because Iâll never be letting you go
(Well you know I...)

Iâm lost without you
And thereâs nothing I can do
Youâre the one I canât go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
Iâve got you now and
Iâm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment Iâm with you
Itâs like Iâm holding on to heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
Iâll hold on, hold on

And if I could write a symphony
Then baby you would be my melody
And you would flow like a river
Slowly going on forever
Like a feather thatâs blowing away
Like everyone that needs a fairytale
Like every motherâs love that never fails
Like every game that needs a player
Every sinner needs a savior
I'm the villain you're willing to save
Now you know why

Iâm lost without you
And thereâs nothing I can do
Youâre the one I canât go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
Iâve got you now and
Iâm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment Iâm with you
Itâs like Iâm holding on to heaven

And Iâm willing to wait
Just to see you another day
What Iâm waiting for
Will wash this pain away
And itâs never too late
(Never too late...)

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
Iâll hold on and hold on
Now you know why

Iâm lost without you
And thereâs nothing I can do
Youâre the one I canât go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
Iâve got you now and
Iâm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment Iâm with you
Itâs like Iâm holding on to heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
'Cause every moment Iâm with you
Itâs like Iâm holding on to heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
'Cause every moment Iâm with you
Itâs like Iâm holding on to heaven
