Lyrics:


'Cause I'm all that you want, girl
All that you can have, girl
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby

Looks like you've been starving
You've got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, yeah

Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two, for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby

So you want some more
Well, I'm open 24
Wanna keep you satisfied
Customer's always right
Hope you've got some room
...
Gonna hit that sweet tooth, yeah

Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two, for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

'Cause I'm all that you want, girl
All that you can have, girl
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby

'Cause I'm all that you want, girl
All that you can have, girl
...like a buffet
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appÃ©tit, baby
