Lyrics:


Heart, I know Iâve been hard on you
Iâm sorry for the things Iâve put you through
Before you start to break on me or ask for sympathy
I need to make you see

Oh, heart, Iâm not sure itâs been long enough
To say that what I feel is really love
Thereâs just one way to learn, sometimes weâll get hurt
And right now itâs our turn

Give it time, help me through
Heart, we can do this together
Youâre my strength, youâre my soul
I need you now more than ever

Heart, all the hurt will soon be gone
If youâll, if youâll just keep on being strong
You will always be my friend, so keep on hangin' in
And weâll find love again

Give it time (Give it time), help me through (Help me through)
Heart, we can do this together
Youâre my strength (Youâre my strength), youâre my soul
I need you now more than ever

Heart, I know Iâve been hard on you
Iâm sorry for the things I put you through
Please donât you break on me, I need to make you see
It wasnât meant to be

âCause you will always be my friend, so keep on hangin' in
And weâll find love again
