Lyrics:


No
I-l-u-s-i-e-l

Light enters darkness
No shame no regrets
You give yourself to the unknown
That's when you forget
Drowning in a sea of illusion
The reason the water is wet
This is the real reason

There's only me in you
There's only you in me
There's only me in you
There's only you in me

Sunrise, sunset
Tonight be my master, I'll be your pet
For in the unknown we're both equal
We're both each others' sweat

But for now remember, I love you baby, I really do
There's no one else for me but you

There's no one else for me
There's no one else for me
There's no one else
There's no one else but me
There's no one else but me
There's no one else but me
There's no one else but me
There's no one else but you
(no one else but you)

Now I can touch
Now I can feel
But who will touch me
Know that I'm real
Who will touch me
Who will touch me
Who will?
