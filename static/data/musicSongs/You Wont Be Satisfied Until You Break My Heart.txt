Lyrics:


You won't be satisfied until you break my heart, 
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start! 
I tried to shower you with love and kisses, 
But all I ever get from you is, 
Naggin' and braggin'... 
My poor heart is saggin'... 

The way you toss my heard around's a cryin' shame, 
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same! 
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart, 
Oh you won't be satisfied until you break my heart! 

You won't be satisfied until you break my heart, 
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start! 
I tried to shower you with love and kisses, 
But all I ever get is, 
Naggin' and braggin'... 

My poor heart is saggin'... 

You won't be satisfied until you break my heart, 
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start! 
I tried to shower you with love and kisses, 
But all I ever get from you is, 
Naggin' and braggin'... 
My poor heart is saggin'... 

The way you toss my heard around's a cryin' shame, 
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same! 
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart... 
It doesn't seem fair (those little white lies) 
But you don't seem to care (and now I realize) 
You won't be satisfied, 
Until you've broken my heart!
