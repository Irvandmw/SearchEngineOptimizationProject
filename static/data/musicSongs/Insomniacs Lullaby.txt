Lyrics:


Iâm getting very edgy
Cos youâre trying to take this from me
And itâs something that I wanted so bad
Cos youâre the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos youâre a jealous girl
And all I can say is
Itâs your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say whatâs wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
Iâm losing sleep
I live only for the week

Iâve grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that youâre not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I donât care as long as youâre mine
Itâs happening every time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say whatâs wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
Iâm losing sleep
I live only for the week

And Iâm falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I canât sleep although I think I can
Itâs insomnia I think I have
But who cares when Iâm not your man?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
Iâm losing sleep
I live only for the week
