Lyrics:


No time for goodbye he said
As he faded away
Don't put your life in someone's hands
They're bound to steal it away
Don't hide your mistakes
'Cause they'll find you, burn you
Then he said

If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life

This is my last time she said
As she faded away
It's hard to imagine
But one day you'll end up like me
Then she said

If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life

If you wanna get out alive 
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive 
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life

If I stay it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go I can only hope
That I make it to the other side

If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for

If you wanna get out alive 
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive 
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for

If I stay, it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go I can only hope
That I make it to the other side

If I stay, it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go, and if I go

Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside
