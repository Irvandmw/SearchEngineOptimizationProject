Lyrics:


Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man youâre everything to

Fame if you win it
Oh, it comes and it goes in a minute
Now, whereâs the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer
Someone to really love is the answer
And once youâve found him
Keep trying to build your world around him

Oh, make someone, someone happy
Make just one, one someone happy
And I guarantee you will be happy too

Ooooh, make someone, someone happy
Oh, sometime in live you ought to try make someone happy
And you will be happy too
