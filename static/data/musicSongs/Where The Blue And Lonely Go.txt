Lyrics:


Where the blue and lonely go where the music's loud and clear
It's the only place I know where the blue and lonely go

The street light served to light my way as I make my way downtown
To one of many nightspots I know where they're all found
Yes I'm back again to the lonely life a life that many know
Soon I'll be there with a glass of wine where the blue and lonely go

Where the blue and lonely go where the music's loud and clear...

There was a time when I had love and I tried so to be free
From the life that I was used to it was just too hard for me
Now as I try to keep my heart from letting mem'ries show
I pretend that I'm so happy here where the blue and lonely go

Where the blue and lonely go where the music's loud and clear...

(Where the blue and lonely go where the music's loud and clear
It's the only place I know where the blue and lonely go
Where the blue and lonely go where the music's loud and clear
It's the only place I know where the blue and lonely go)
