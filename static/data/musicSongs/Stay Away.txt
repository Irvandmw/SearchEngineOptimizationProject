Lyrics:


How can I stay away?

I tried your mouth and I can't come back
So little time and I'm way off track
I can't stay away, away, away, away for one night

Hey, wherever I go I still see your face
So little time, there's no time to waste
I can't stay away, away, away, away for one night

Hey, I don't know where your head is now
I've been only thinkin 'bout us
(Thinkin 'bout us)

Don't know what your hands are doin'
I've been only thinkin 'bout touch
Touch, touch, touch me

I can't take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

If my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

The city's so hard when you sleep alone
I need your hands when you drive me home
I can't stay away, away, away, away for one night

Hey, I don't know where your head is now
I've been only thinkin 'bout us
(Thinkin 'bout us)

Don't know what your hands are doin'
I've been only thinkin 'bout touch
Touch, touch, touch me

I can't take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

If my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

How can I stay away?
How can I stay away?

Don't know where your head is now
I've been only thinkin 'bout us

Don't know what your hands are doin'
I've been only thinkin 'bout touch
Touch, touch, touch me

I can't take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

If my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

How can I stay away?
