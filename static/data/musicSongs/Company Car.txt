Lyrics:


Mike was right
When he said I'd put up a fight
To be someone
A fight to be me

But see now
I'm down
Under the pavement
Of capitol hills and lowercase people

As time rolls by
My dreams have become
That which is attainable
Not what I'm looking for!

I've got the company car
I'm the one swinging at two below par
Yeah, I've become one with the ones
That I've never believed in
But I've got the company car

I'm the king of things
I've always despised
I'm the gingerbread man
Who got eaten alive

I'm half-baked, I'm fake!
But see I got hotels on
Park Place and Boardwalk
And two hundred bucks

I pass go butâoh!â
Life's taken its toll
Have I won Monopoly
To forfeit my soul?

But see, I've got the company car
I'm the one swinging at two below par
Yeah, I've become one with the ones
That I've never believed in
But I've got the company car

All the king's horses
At the foot of the wall
They're taking pictures
Of the man who's lost all
Of his masks of pretension
He's got two faces left
His is the one that he hides
On the left behind that smile

Hiding tears and fear
That burns like an engine
It drives him away
From the ones that he loves

Mike was right
"Hey, Mike! We're one of the same
We're the faceless combatants
In the loneliest game"

Ah, but say, I'll wave
As I'm driving by
With that smirk in my eye
Yelling, "Hey! I'm something else. Check me out!"

I've got the company car
I'm the one swinging at two below par
Yeah, I've become one with the ones
That I've never believed in
But I've got the company car

Yeah, check me out
I've got the company car
Yeah, check me out
I've got the company car
