Lyrics:


I am the trailer park queen
Jimmy pull up in his blue Chevy Nova
I get him strawberry ice cream
I have been dying for him to come over

We're gonna listen to the Beach Boys
We're gonna ride in the rollercoaster
When we get high, Jimmy propose
Jimmy gon' buy me a Coca Cola
Jimmy gonna buy me a Coca Cola
Jimmy gonna buy me a Coca Cola

I am the New Jersey dance queen
Jimmy's the king of Ticonderoga
When we're together, we're so mean
When we're together, no one can take over
It's love, it's love

We're gonna listen to the Beach Boys
We're gonna ride in the rollercoaster
When we get high, Jimmy propose
Jimmy gon' buy me a Coca Cola
He gonna buy me a Coca Cola
Jimmy gonna buy me a Coca Cola

We're going to Coney Island
We're going to Coney Island
We are in love and we're flying
We are in love and we're flying

We're gonna listen to the Beach Boys
We're gonna ride in the rollercoaster
When we get high, Jimmy propose
Jimmy gon' buy me a Coca Cola
Gon' buy me a Coca Cola
Jimmy gonna buy me a Coca Cola

I never loved somebody so much
I said Jay, get into the car and if you love me stay
And drive me far, far away from who me and you are
And I wanna go to Coney Island
I wanna go to Coney Island

So we listen to the Beach Boys
Jimmy drive me to Coney Island
When we get there, Jimmy propose
I said Jay you don't know how happy I am
