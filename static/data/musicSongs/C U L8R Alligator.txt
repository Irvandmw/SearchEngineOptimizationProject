Lyrics:


Donât say Iâll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know itâs not true
I know youâre seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby

I know they say Iâm cheap
And youâre two-timing me
Thatâs what you get
Weâre in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know youâll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

Youâre all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logicâs flawed and youâve been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
Youâre all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know youâre scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

I know thatâs not the way
Most people meet but, hey
Weâre living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
Youâre not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
Youâre not the only one
Iâve heard say, âMaybeâ

Youâre all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logicâs flawed and youâve been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
Youâre all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know youâre scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?
