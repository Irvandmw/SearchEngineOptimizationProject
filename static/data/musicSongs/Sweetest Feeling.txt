Lyrics:


I put my hair up, I slap my lipstick on, I can't decide what to wear
I try my clothes on about a hundred times, I wanna get it right

But as long as I got this perfect feelin' I know that everything will be right
As long as I got this sweetest feelin' my troubles will be out of my sight
La da da da da da da da da da da da, my troubles will be miles away
La da da da da da da da da da da da, my troubles will be miles away

I slip my shoes on, take a spin or two, tell me, "how does this look to you?"
In the mirror, I blow a kiss and scoot 'cause I'm runnin' late for you

But as long as I got this perfect feelin' I know that everything will be right
As long as I got this sweetest feelin' my troubles will be out of my sight
La da da da da da da da da da da da, my troubles will be miles away
La da da da da da da da da da da da, my troubles will be miles away

When you take me all around this town, all the wonder we've seen

As long as I got this perfect feelin' I know that everything will be right
As long as I got this sweetest feelin' my troubles will be out of my sight
La da da da da da da da da da da da, my troubles will be miles away
