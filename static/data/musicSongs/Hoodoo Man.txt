Lyrics:


Well, I wonder what's exactly the matter.
Child you know the time.
Seemed like an hour.
Everything done changed.

[Chorus:]
I hold up my hand.
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand.
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man.

Well, I buzzed your bell this morning;
You had your elevator running slow.
I buzzed your bell, little woman,
Take me on the third floor.

[Chorus]

[Repeat Second Verse]

[Repeat First Verse]
