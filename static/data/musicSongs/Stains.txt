Lyrics:


Trill, yeah
That's how it is
Pluto

How many stains you hit
I don't know, how many stains
Private plane
Converted up with a private plane
Cooking it up with baking soda
How many chains
You ain't thinking how I'm thinking
I'm going to the bank
I come in a tank
I come with the drank
I come with the drapes
I crush out the face
Patek Phillipe, I'm too unique
Gotta stop all the leaks
Getting caught with the freaks

I pour up codeine
I can't go to sleep
Criminal mind
Thanks to the gang, gang
Louboutins, sitting in a row
Louis Vuitton's, mink on the flows
My migo the coldest
He got me the frozest
I ordered it loaded, soon as they touched down
I sold it
The money is stacked up off the ground
You could never fold it
I done got racked up
I done stacked up me a fortune
Colossal, enormous
Have you seen my preformance
You making it drizzle
I got thunder and storming
Cash on deliver, hope you're not recording
(Cash on deliver, hope you're not recording)

How many stains you hit
I don't know, how many stains
Private plane
Converted up with a private plane
Cooking it up with baking soda
How many chains
You ain't thinking how I'm thinking
I'm going to the bank
I come in a tank
I come with the drank
I come with the drapes
I crush out the face
Patek Phillipe, I'm too unique
Gotta stop all the leaks
Getting caught with the freaks

I got you comfortable
Because she say she love me
I got some commas
They can't be discussed
I weigh a ton in these streets
Ain't no discussion
I started off with a couple watches
I got 'em busted
I got a flooded Richard Mille
It ain't no cuffing
Screaming, blushing
She came from Russia
Digital scale
My kind is rare
I had to prevail
I made it through Hell
See the wheel on the right
When you live overseas
Think it came overnight
How I make it look easy
Ain't a regular nigga
I accept that
Got ahead of you niggas
And I never took a step back

How many stains you hit
I don't know, how many stains
Private plane
Converted up with a private plane
Cooking it up with baking soda
How many chains
You ain't thinking how I'm thinking
I'm going to the bank
I come in a tank
I come with the drank
I come with the drapes
I crush out the face
Patek Phillipe, I'm too unique
Gotta stop all the leaks
Getting caught with the freaks
