Lyrics:


Oh give me some hominy grits
And some red sugar-cured ham
Give me a great big bowl of gravy
I'd be such a happy man
If I could see the magnolias and azaleas in bloom
Let me up to the table and give me lots of elbow room

Then pass me that mammy fried okie
And some good old black eyed peas
Give me a hay rack full of biscuits
Make my coffee black if you please
If you feed me out of Dixie in a style so grand
You'll have yourself a happy man
Sorghum molasses
You'll have yourself a happy man

Now give me some of the hominy grits boy
Or shut my mouth with a great big slab of that sugar-cured ham
And about a half a gallon of this old thickened gravy
And brother you're gonna have yourself a mighty happy man
Well it seems like when you eat stuff like that
You can see the magnolias on them honeysuckles
Well you knows that they're in bloom
Oh set me down to that table, boy, scoot over
And give me lots of elbow room

Then pass me that mammy-fried okie
And some good old black eyed peas
Give me a hayrack full of hot biscuits
And make my coffee black if you please
If you feed me out of Dixie in a style oh so grand
You'll have yourself a happy man

Sorghum molasses
You'll have yourself a happy man
