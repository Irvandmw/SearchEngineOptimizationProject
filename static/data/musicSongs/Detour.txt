Lyrics:


Headed down life's crooked road
Lots of things there that I never knowed
Because of me not knowin' I now pine

Trouble got right on my trail
I spent the next five years in jail
Should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead
Detour, paid no mind to what it said
Detour, all these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

Well when I got to the place
Where that sign told be about my face
Well, I figured all of my worries were behind

But the farther I go
I find more chug holes there in the road
I should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead
Detour, paid no mind to what it said
Detour, all these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

Well, I got stuck down in the mud
All my hopes fell there with a thud
I felt like my heartstrings were made of twine

I had no power to get
From that hole I was in yet
I should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead
Detour, paid no mind to what it said
Detour, all these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign
Should have read that detour sign
