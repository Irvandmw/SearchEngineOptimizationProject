Lyrics:


There is a roadway
Muddy and foxgloved
Whenever I'd had life enough
My heart is screaming of

And in a few days
I will be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me
Is yours just as it was

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark,
The light, the flame

The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

Tell me if somehow
Some of it remains
How long you would wait for me
How long I've been away

The shape that I'm in now
Your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Or just tell me about your day

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark,
The light, the shame

The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
Half as beautiful too
