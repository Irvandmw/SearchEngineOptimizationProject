Lyrics:


You're my one and only love
I've loved you from the start
My one and only love
I've given you my heart
And though we're worlds apart
You're all I'm thinkin' of
My one and only love

Though you don't know I'm alive
I still can hope and pray
The time will soon arrive
And on that lucky day
You'd smile at me and say
My one and only love

[Instrumental Interlude]

Though you don't know I'm alive
I still can hope and pray
The time will soon arrive
And on that lucky day
You'd smile at me and say
My one and only love

My one and only love
My one and only love
