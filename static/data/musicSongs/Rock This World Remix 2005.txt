Lyrics:


Everybody wants something
That seems to hard to get
So I sit here on the street in Venice
waiting for the sun to set
Watching people living lives
Wondering what means
Sometimes getting what you want
Is easier than it seems

I don't wanna save the day
I just wanna get my way and

[CHORUS]
Rock this world
Read my lips and watch 'em curl
Rock this world
It don't take much to please this girl
I don't need the glitter
Don't believe the hype
You might say I'm the simple type
Like any other girl
Who wants to rock this world

Everybody's going somewhere
So why don't you and I?
We're all part of the same parade
Just people passing by
And anything can happen
When the sun goes down like this
Maybe it's just a miracle
When you find some happiness

I don't wanna save the day
I just wanna get my way and

[REPEAT CHORUS]

People, can you hear me?
I want you to come near me
Can you feel the pull
It can be so beautiful

Rock this world
(Rock this world)
Read my lips and watch 'em curl
(Rock this world)
Rock this world
(Please this girl)
It don't take much to please this girl
(Rock this world)
I don't need the presents
Don't believe the hype
You might say I'm the simple type
Like any other girl
Who wants to rock this world

Rock this world
[Repeats and fades away]
