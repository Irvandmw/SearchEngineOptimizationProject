Lyrics:


We rode the train,
From paris to the cold atlantic shore.
The winter rain
Kept us in each others arms until the dawn,
Do you remember?
Faster than the sun,
Flying higher than everyone.
Like a dream too good to last,
I won't regret the past.

Here with me,
Deep down in my soul now and forever.
A candle for the dark, I need you
Here with me,
A story with an unexpected end.

The morning plane,
Through empty doors a mountain in the sky.
Golden chain, the autumn treetops cast
Another light.
Do you remember?
We have no common ground,
Treasure lost will not be found.
We can blame our wild at heart,
From now until the start.

Here with me,
Deep down in my soul now and forever,
A candle for the dark I need you,
Here with me,
A story with an unexpected end.

Remember feelings I have known,
And chasing dreams I've never done,
We're losing let us walk away,
Hold me in your arms before you go.

Here with me,
Deep down in my soul now and forever.
A candle for the dark, I need you
Here with me,
A story with an unexpected end.

Everywhere I go you're here with me.
