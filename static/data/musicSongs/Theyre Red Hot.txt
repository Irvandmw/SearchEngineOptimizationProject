Lyrics:


Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
I got a girl, she's long and tall,
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
Yes she got 'em for sale.

Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
She got two for a nickel, four for a dime,
Would sell you more, but they ain't none of mine.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale, I mean.
Yes she got 'em for sale.

Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
I got a letter from a girl in the room,
Got something good, gonna bring it home soon.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale, I mean.
Yes she got 'em for sale.

Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
That billy goat backed in a bumble bee nest,
Ever since that he can't take any rest.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale, I mean.
Yes she got 'em for sale.

Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
Me and my babe bought a V-8 Ford,
We dropped that thing on the running board.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale, I mean.
Yes she got 'em for sale.

Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
You know the monkey and the baboon playing in the grass,
Monkey stuck his finger in the Good Gulf Gas.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale, I mean.
Yes she got 'em for sale.

Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale.
I got a girl, she's long and tall,
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall.
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes she got 'em for sale, I mean.
Yes she got 'em for sale.
Yes she got 'em for sale, I mean.
Yes she got 'em for sale.
