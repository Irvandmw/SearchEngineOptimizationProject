Lyrics:


Say yes
My mama always said, "Life's better when you say yes"
All that you can do is dare to do your best
When your hand is on your heart, and it's beating out your chest
You know you're blessed

She said, "I don't wanna feel like sitting down
Feels like both my feet are stuck to the ground
Every day, I get a little more left out
But it don't get me down
No, it don't get me down"

'Cause I'm not getting any younger (Oh no)
Some new kids tryna steal my thunder (Oh no)
But I would never take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back to the start
'Cause in my heart, I'm still a youngster

Say no
My daddy always said, "Don't sweat it when they say no"
There's so much more to you than you will ever know
Hold on to your dreams, don't ever let them go-o-o
It's your show

She said, "I don't wanna feel like sitting down
Feels like both my feet are stuck to the ground
Every day, I get a little more left out
But it don't get me down
No, it don't get me down"

'Cause I'm not getting any younger (Oh no)
Some new kids tryna steal my thunder (Oh no)
But I would never take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back to the start
'Cause in my heart, I'm still a youngster

Some times my face ain't the face I remember it being
But I'm the same kid that I used to be

No, I'm not getting any younger (Oh no)
Some new kids tryna steal my thunder (Oh no)
But I would never take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back to the start
'Cause in my heart, I'm still a youngster
'Cause I'm not getting any younger (Oh no)
Some new kids tryna steal my thunder (Oh no)
But I would never take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back to the start
'Cause in my heart, I'm still a youngster
