Lyrics:


Man, don't you know that I'm loco?

I was chilling right around my way
21st Eastside at the beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talking shit with his homies
Like he was a straight G!

Asking where I'm from while he running up
Gangbang my set on everyone of them
(20s nigga)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nothing but the gangbang

What's seen is what's sawn
Dogg is the law
I have you niggas running like a marathon
Lil G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talking 'bout they gon' get my chain, and they gon' leave with it

But they don't know
Once they get close
It's tic tac toe
Three motherfuckers laid on the floor
(Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray
I heard an ese say
He said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopyâhe went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

Blaow
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's 3 motherfuckers dead, and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas 'a scream with plea
But for a G like me it's just a case
Really you could see

I crack the Mac back
And pop off rolling
And smack your neck back
You drop off falling
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me

Fuck that. I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl
You would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all? Been a Dogg
Smoke you like a menthol

You think you know?
But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dough?
What the fuck? No

See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed
All you'll hear my enemies going

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopyâhe went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

Blaow
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth
God damn
And Snoop 'a keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets
Run with them niggas with the heat

You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be beast of the East, motherfucker

I never hesitate to blaze
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team 'cause my peoples
Are screaming that we need more
For fun or is it legal

Put the bang on this song
Make it feel like a drive-by
It's a shame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
But when I mobbing LA
All I hear the eses say
They go

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopyâhe went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

Blaow
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
