Lyrics:


[John Legend:]
Yeah we used to flirt with freedom 'fore everybody knew our name
We became their favorite secret, love for love and not for fame
Oh, when I was your user, your FaceTime abuser, dose after dose 'til we crashed
Now they bet on our game, say well go down in flames, it's too good but we never could last

[John Legend & Miguel:]
But, oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
But, oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload, love, love...
Don't we always make a show of love, love, love, love, yeah...

[Miguel:]
Let that cellphone ring, let that bluebird sing, let that message say unread
Let them talk about us, let them talk too much while we rule the whole world from our bed

[John Legend & Miguel:]
'Cause, oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
Oh, chained our life together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?

'Cause, oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
Oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?
