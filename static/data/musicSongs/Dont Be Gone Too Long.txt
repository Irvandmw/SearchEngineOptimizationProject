Lyrics:


[Chris Brown and Ariana Grande:]
I dug a single seed into the ground
I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around
You'll see a rose, rose
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere, that you can find me
On a train to Paris going nowhere, draw the bridge behind me

Don't be gone too long (too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone
When you're, when you're gone
When you're gone

Golden leaves are dancing on the ground
It's getting cold, cold
Safe from time, we'll be forever young
Never old, old
See a ball of fire out in space, zooming up behind me
All the wonder written on your face
Was there inside me

Don't be gone too long (too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone
When you're, when you're gone
When you're gone

Bring it back to me, bring it back to me, is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me, is it over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me

Don't be gone too long, too long
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long, too long
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone?
Don't be gone too long, too long
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long, too long
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone?
