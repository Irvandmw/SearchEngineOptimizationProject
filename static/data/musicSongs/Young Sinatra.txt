Lyrics:


[Sample from Life's A Bitch by Nas:]
Visualizing the realism of life in actuality

[Verse 1:]
Various women I'm swimming in like a shark
Tear the pussy apart
Shawty it's on after dark

Step to the mic and now I got ya
Call me Young Sinatra
The flow is prominent
Hella diming it, on time with it
When I'm rhyming it, several labels itching to sign with it

Now check the women I'm bringing in with these I'll synonyms
Softly killing 'em
In other words; I'm Lauryn Hillin 'em
I swear to God if I could I'd never turn the page

Living the rest of my days on stage
Fucking with bitches that never age
I'm so fly that I defy the laws of physics
I ain't think it was possible for a check to have this many digits, Mathematically exquisite

Am I cocky? Just a smidget
If you want beef then we can supersize
Freshman in the game, so they wanna haze me like my name Isaac
I killed the beat and dig a ditch just to fossilize
To make sure none of you bammers try to reprise it

[Chorus:]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some

[Verse 2:]
I'm working a nine to five just to survive
Barely staying alive
Hard to stay focused without the drive
See I bus tables and my homie Castro is a waiter

I can't wait to blow and say "I told you so haters!"
Living the life of a egotistical pistol gripper
Isn't a life for me, I'd rather grip mics and a undo girls zippers
But not them ho girls, meet me after the show girls, the take it slow girls, have 'em coming back for mo' girls

(Visualizin the realism of life and actuality)

[Verse 3:]
Various managers coming up talking bout they got me
But really they shady and they slim in a pair of Versaces
I know you see me shining, and practicing and grinding
While they conform to the norm you'll catch me designing

A different type of sound
While you was stuck inside the box, I had already been around
Inner piece and happiness I'm always tryna' find it
And I kinda got the feeling that a woman is behind it

So I'm always chasing tails the real life sonic
And I'm always spitting fire half black, half demonic
Nah, I'm half black and half white, c'mon this sound it had to come from somewhere, right?
Nah, Nah, see homie race is not the issue, and if you stepping to me like it is I'll dismiss you

The second you listen
The second I got you
I swear to God I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

[Chorus:]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some (plus some, plus some)
