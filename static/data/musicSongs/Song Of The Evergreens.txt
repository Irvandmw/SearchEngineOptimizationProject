Lyrics:


Listen to the briskly whistling winter evergreen
Whispering through the frozen morning light

And tell me what's to come

Saying my time is near
Never fear
I'll close each year
I'm winter

Reminding me to trade my t-shirts for my woven wools
Trade my sandals for my skis
Whispered warnings on the wind
Saying soon come the dancing snowflakes
They're kissing every tree
They're kissing ever you and me
Please hurry

Falling
Dazzling dancing diamonds
From the sky
Prisms
Rainbow sparkled flurries
In our eyes

Flying across the frozen crystal
Meadow ponds of ice
Race the snow
We build a warming fire there
Cuddle close and wine and dine
The setting sun
The morning light will find us high
Shooting down the glistening
Mountainside
Screaming through the whispering pines
The freedom of each day
Will cleanse our minds

I can hardly wait for winter
I can hardly wait for the snow
I can hardly hardly wait for winter
I can hardly wait for the snow

Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow
