Lyrics:
Lyrics:


We got some mistletoe
Hung from the bow of the boat
Stockings are filled with sunshine rays
It's Christmas in Blue Chair Bay

There's lights up in every palm
My soul like the sea is calm
Tonight we're going to the boat parade
It's Christmas in Blue Chair Bay

Everybody raise a glass 
With me right now
To all of those up in the snow
From all of us down South
Tis the season for believin'
In faith and family
Wish you were here with me

We cleared out a place in the sand
For Dancer and Prancer to land
We saved the boat slip for Santa's sleigh
It's Christmas in Blue Chair Bay

Everybody raise a glass 
With me right now
To all of those up in the snow
From all of us down South
Tis the season for believin'
In faith and family
Wish you were here with me
By the sea, a little numb
From drinking rum

Oh I think I'll sit right here
Pray for a peaceful year
Lots of love Happy Holidays to you
From Blue Chair Bay
Merry Christmas from Blue Chair Bay

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Lots of love Happy Holidays to you
From Blue Chair Bay
Merry Christmas from Blue Chair Bay
