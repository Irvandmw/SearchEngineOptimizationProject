Lyrics:


You wanna talk to me,
You got many things to say.
You want the spirit to be speaking through,
But your lust for comfort get in the way.
I can read it in your eyes, oh,
What your heart will not reveal.
And that old evil burden has been draggin' you down,
Bound to grind you 'neath the wheel

Yonder comes sin.
(Walkin' like a man, talkin' like an angel.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Proud like a peacock, swift like an eagle.)
Look at your feet, see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they been into.
Can't you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin.

You see this woman standin' next to me.
She's foreign to your sight.
Well, her eyes may be a different colour than mine,
But her blood is red and her bones are white.
You've been seeking them eternal, spiritual things,
But your fifty-dollar smile confirms
You're still tryin' to buy your way into the dreams of them,
Whose bodies will be food for worms.

Yonder comes sin.
(Ready and steady, willing and able.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Standin' on the chair, standin' on the table.)
Look at your feet, see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they've been into.
Can't you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin.

I say: See them six wild horses, honey.
You say: I don't even see one..
You say: Point them out to me, love.
I say: Honey I got to run.
My brother's blood is crying from the grave,
But you can't hear the voice.
I stand in jeopardy every hour,
Wonderin' what reason you have to rejoice.

Yonder comes sin.
(Down on your knees, down into the ditches.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Vomiting up jewels, vomiting up riches.)
Look at your feet see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they've been into.
Enough to put you to tail-spin.
Yonder comes sin.

Jeremiah preached repentance
To those that would turn from hell.
But the critics all gave him such bad reviews.
Put him down at the bottom of a well.
Kept on talking anyway,
As the people were put into chains.
Wasn't nobody there to say "Bon voyage"
Or shatter any bottles of champagne.

Yonder comes sin.
(Cracking that whip, just like a feather.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Put a knife in your back while talking about the weather.)
Look at your feet see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they've been into.
Can you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin.
