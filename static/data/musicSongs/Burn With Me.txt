Lyrics:


Sparks will fly
We can burn this house down
Say good night
To everything we are now

Kiss me, kill me
Just give in and let go
Let's live this life
Like there's no tomorrow

Burn with me one last time
All we leave are ashes, embers in the fire
Burn with me, smoke will rise
Tell me of a liar walking through the fire
And burn with me

Wrong, or right
I'm waiting on an answer
Save this life
Right now is all that matters

Kiss me, thrill me
Tell me all your secrets
Whisper to me
I promise that I'll keep it

Burn with me one last time
All we leave are ashes, embers in the fire
Burn with me, smoke will rise
Tell me of a liar walking through the fire
Burn with me

It's my heart beating down your bedroom door
Here's the way that you keep me coming back for more
When you say it's caught now in flames

Burn with me one last time
All we leave are ashes, embers in the fire
Burn with me, smoke will rise
Tell me of a liar walking through the fire
Burn with me one last time
All we leave are ashes, embers in the fire
Burn with me
Burn with me
Burn with me
Come burn with me

Let's live this life
Like there's no tomorrow
