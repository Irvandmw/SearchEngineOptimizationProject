Lyrics:


I wanna live I wanna die
Wanna find a place where I can hide
Wanna think about the world
And how I got to this girl
Wanna laugh I wanna cry
Wanna look right into your eyes
Wanna see everything there is to see in this world

We got a lot to say
We got a lot of time
To say everything that's on our minds

Wanna swim I wanna fly
Wanna be a cloud up in the sky
Wanna watch the sun go down
Wanna know you're always around
Wanna know everything that anyone would ever wanna know
Wanna watch television listen to the radio

We got a lot to say
We got a lot of time
Say everything that's on our minds

Wanna see everything there is to see in this world
I wanna walk around and talk to all the pretty girls
I don't see anything that anyone wants me to see
I just be

We got a lot to say
We got a lot of time
To say everything that's on our minds

We got a lot to say
All we've got is time
Say everything that's on our minds
