Lyrics:


Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year itâs all business
It is a shame that a couple of âem are off limits
No offence to my nigga, itâs just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippinâ
I know I got a couple things that Lilâ Wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Donât let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I canât let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when itâs lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warholâs for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like Iâm driving into something
Bitches on the kid like Iâm Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!
