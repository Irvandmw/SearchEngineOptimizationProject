Lyrics:


Aye yeah
M-M-M-Make it hot
Come up in this bitch, make it rock (rock)
Put it in your face make it pop
These niggas know Megan need top

These bitches ain't really bout action (uh unh)
A lot of these hoes just acting (ew)
I'll wrap a bitch up, that's traction
Then put her trash ass back in the trash can
And I'm a bad motherfucker with the backhand
And if you come too close imma crack in
See I already peep where you lacking
You ain't even hear me when I came in the back end
Oh there I go, Stallion hoe
Stunting like yo daddy though
See me out in person
Now you know what niggas trippen on
I had to cut the steak
No red meat on my lobster plate
Ion go back and forth, ion play them games
I let the bitch play herself, that's masturbate
I'm new in the game, that's rookie
Ain't nobody had these cookies
If you wanna meet a pimp then book me
Ian met a bitch yet that shook me
Imma real big dog, you a copy cat
You a talent show hoe, imma platinum plaque
Bitch I'm real in the field, you a practice mat
And I'm coming for ya neck, better watch your back
Hello? Who is this?
Another corporation talking business
Got a fit, needa get me out to Italy
Another head doctor tryna come lick me

Watch out (watch out)
Back up (back up)
Imma need a lil room so I can act up (act up)
Watch out
Get, get, get down bitch
Megan is your master now sit down bitch

I take meetings with designers
I don't tongue wrestle with rhymers
My purse made out of piranhas
Meaning my money private
Meaning my name is heavy
Meaning lil bitch don't test me
Meaning no bitch gon check me
Meaning bitch come correctly
I wreck all hoes, no challenge
Stalli come through, do damage
I handle these hoes, that's manage
These bitches ain't wrecking, lemme handle it

Aye ha
Make it hot
Come up in this bitch, make it rock (rock)
Put it in your face make it pop
These niggas know Megan need top

Watch out (watch out)
Back up (back up)
Imma need a lil room so I can act up (act up)
Watch out (watch out)
Back up (back up)
Throw it air and watch it mack up
Watch out (watch out)
Back up (back up)
On the move tryna run a damn sack up
Watch out (watch out)
Back up (back up)
Imma need a lil room so I can act up (act up)

I-I-I'm realer than ever
B-B-Bitches ain't on my level
M-M-Money like I embezzle
I'm bassing without no treble
Meaning bitches in trouble
Stunting without a double
These bitches built like McDoubles
I'm fancy like blouse with ruffles
These bitches is out of place
Meaning they in my way
Meaning they got to pay
Meaning I'm going ape
Get down on them knees trick
You belong to me bitch
You gon bust these plays
While I sip this Hennessy bitch

Watch out (watch out)
Back up (back up)
If you get too close imma act up
Watch out (watch out)
Back up (back up)
Make one wrong move, imma act up
Get down on them knees bitch
Now you work for me trick
Need a couple M's so I stay in double C's bitch
Watch out (watch out)
Back up (back up)
Hoe get out of line, get clapped up
Watch out (watch out)
Back up (back up)
Stalli in this bitch finna act up
