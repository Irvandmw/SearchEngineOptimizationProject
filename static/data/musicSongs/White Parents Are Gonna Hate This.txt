Lyrics:


My name is SAINt JHN
You niggas might... like get other jobs or somethin'

Fucked up nigga, good advice yeah
Fucked up nigga, good advice yeah
Fucked up nigga, good advice yeah
Fucked up nigga, good advice yeah
How much drug did you take tonight, tonight
How much blow did you take tonight, tonight
How much drink did you sip tonight, tonight
How much paper in your brick tonight, tonight, tonight

It feel like 2012, a nigga [?] at the shotty, on the block
That nigga he might let it off right now
Fucking up the motherfucking money
Got me spendinâ like a dummy
Boy you're lookin' at a boss right now
Go change that for me, Gucci looking like Tekashi, man
Kami wouldnât' have tried it, it's a loss right now
Pull up with a army full of niggas or forgivers
So that I could sing it [?] right now
You never seen a nigga this litt, not in your motherfuckin' life
You ain't never seen a nigga this rich
I pull a bad guy, I ain't tryna be polite
Hold a motherfucking minute, just a motherfucking minute
I'ma be that fucking nigga till I die
Wait a motherfucking minute, ain't another fucking minute
Hear that motherfucker boominâ like July
You never seen a nigga this litt, not in your motherfuckinâ life
You ain't never seen a nigga this rich
I pull a bad guy, I ainât tryna be polite

How much drug did you take tonight, tonight
How much blow did you take tonight, tonight
How much drink did you sip tonight, tonight
How much paper in your brick tonight, tonight, tonight
It feel like-
Fucked up nigga, good advice yeah
Fucked up nigga, good advice yeah
Fucked up nigga, good advice yeah
Fucked up nigga, good advice yeah
