Lyrics:


I said, "Man, what are you doing here?"
I saw the band just bought you a beer
I used to see your face all over
TV shows and magazine covers
He said, I went through a fortune just like that
Down to the shirt that I got on my back
I said "How? ", he said, "Pretty damn fast"
But hey man, since you asked

I spent it on high living, wild women
That roulette wheel that I kept it spinning
Beachside bars, big shiny cars
Long vacations in warm locations
I was going nonstop till I squeezed every drop
Of that good time, top shelf sweet life that I tasted
And to tell you the truth, the rest, I just wasted

He kinda laughed underneath those shades
He said, yeah son, I had it made
I had a big boat, it made me smile
It burned money, gallons to miles
I really don't worry 'bout where it went
'Cause it's still fun thinking 'bout when

I spent it on high living, wild women
That roulette wheel that I kept it spinning
Beachside bars, big shiny cars
Long vacations in warm locations
I was going nonstop till I squeezed every drop
Of that good time top shelf, sweet life that I tasted
And to tell you the truth
The rest, I just wasted
Yeah, I could have put it in the bank somewhere and saved it
No son, you ain't never gonna hear me complaining

I spent it on high living, big tipping limo rides and champagne sippin'
First class tickets to who knows where?
It really didn't matter 'til we got there
I was going nonstop till I squeezed every drop
Of that good time, top shelf sweet life that I tasted
And to tell you the truth the rest, I just wasted

I spent it on loving and living
Loved every minute
The rest I wasted
The rest I wasted
