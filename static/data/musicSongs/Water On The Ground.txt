Lyrics:


(Eric Clapton)
Water on the ground, cloud on the sun,
Moon on the rise and the wind on the run.
But you know it's only water,
Water on the ground.

Snow is falling, weather is cold.
Maybe I'm just getting old.
And I think it's only water,
Water on the ground.

Back to the rivers, back to the sea,
Keeps on running, just like me.
But you know it's only water,
Water on the ground.
