Lyrics:


Your love is rain, my heart the flower, I need your love or I will die
My very life is in your power, will I wither and fade or bloom to the sky
Aqua de Beber, Give the flower water to drink
Aqua de Beber, Give the flower water to drink
The rain can fall on distant deserts, the rain can fall upon the sea
The rain can fall upon the flower, since the rain has to fall let it fall on me
Aqua de Beber, Give the flower water to drink
Aqua de Beber, Give the flower water to drink
