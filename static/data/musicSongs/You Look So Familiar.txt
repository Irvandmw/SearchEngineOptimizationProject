Lyrics:


I never thought I'd ever be caught
Using an old cliche
I'm on a spot believe it or not
This is all I can think of to say

You look so familiar
Have we ever met before
Everything about you seems to ring a bell
You look so familiar
Have we been this close before
If my heart could talk you'd hear it sing as well
There must be an explanation
What I feel is not imagination
You look so familiar
Now it all comes back it seems
I remember you were in my dreams
I remember you were in my dreams
