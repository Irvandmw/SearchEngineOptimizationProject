Lyrics:


I wouldn't wear, who wouldn't wear
She didn't wear, your dress

I wouldn't wear your woman's dress
And I wouldn't look good in her dress
You see my wife and see my
You don't think so but I do

I wouldn't wear, who wouldn't wear
She didn't wear, your dress

I know they are ripe tomatoes
Just what this town is due to burn
But this dress is another tone
The way you wear your dress is wrong
Don't offend, you're made of curves
You have your little head
One shade of a woman's dress is
He wants to bring it down to you

I wouldn't wear, who wouldn't wear
She didn't wear, your dress

I wouldn't wear your woman's dress
And I wouldn't look good in her dress
You asked me if I could handle that
I wouldn't wear your woman's dress, no

I wouldn't wear, who wouldn't wear
She didn't wear, your dress

A deadbeat is having this
A catastrophe, tampax cheeze-whiz
I don't know what to say but I think I'm gonna burst and
I wouldn't wear your woman's dress
And I wouldn't look good in her dress
And you.. saw me.. oh yeah no

I wouldn't wear, who wouldn't wear
She didn't wear, your dress

I wouldn't wear your woman's dress
And I wouldn't look good in her dress
Gotta change, but I don't wanna
Check it out, check it out, check it out

I wouldn't wear, who wouldn't wear
She didn't wear, your dress

Get funky now..

I know they are ripe tomatoes
Just what this town is due to burn
But this dress is another tone
The way you wear your dress is wrong
Don't offend, you're made of curves
You have your little head
One shade of a woman's dress is
He wants to bring it down to you

I wouldn't wear, who wouldn't wear
She didn't wear, your dress

No shoe-tale

I wouldn't wear, who wouldn't wear
She didn't wear, your dress

Pork chop
