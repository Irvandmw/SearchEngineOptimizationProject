Lyrics:


Remember the words you told me
Love me till the day I die
Surrender my everything
Cos you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me
Out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah you need it
All of the time
Yeah ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me
Back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
Cause I need it, yeah I need it
All of the time
Yeah ooh, ooh, ooh

Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Till one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me
Out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah you need it
All of the time
Yeah ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me
Back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
Cos I need it, yeah I need it
All of the time
Yeah ooh, ooh, ooh

You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away
Running away from you
From you

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me
Out of your life
And I'm just a

Youngblood
But you need it, yeah you need it
All of the time
Yeah ooh, ooh, ooh

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me
Out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah you need it
All of the time
Yeah ooh, ooh, ooh
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me
Out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
