Lyrics:


Well I can see your reflection in the flickerin' light
Girl you look like a vision dancin' out of the night
With your hole body swayin' to the sound of the beat
And your hair softly swirlin' while you hustle your feet

You're the finest lookin' thing I ever knew
I wanna move with you

Now when you dance to the music there's a look in your eyes
That's a part of the devil in an angels disguise
When you do what you're doin' girl, you sure get to me
'Cause I stop and wonder how your sweet love would be

You're the finest lookin' thing I ever knew
I wanna move with you

I can hear the music all around us
And I can feel you comin' close to me
I can see the people all around us
But baby you're the only one that I can see

Well I could go on forever bein' right by your side
'Cause you know how to move me and I'm so satisfied
If there was no tomorrow I could make it alright
If you'd say you love me and you'd be mine

You're the finest lookin' thing I ever knew
I wanna move with you

Yes I do, I wanna move, keep on movin'
I wanna move, keep on movin' on
