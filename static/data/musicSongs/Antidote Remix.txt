Lyrics:


Yeah, hey
Don't you open up that window (Baby)
Don't you let out that antidote (Huh)

I mix Patron with the Hennessy (Woo)
Somebody call me a Hoover (Hoover)
Too much to lose on my enemies
I'm 'bout to call me a shooter (Yeah)
I'm paying to make you a target (Target)
Lord knows I don't want to do it (Woo)
I got 20k in my joggers (Joggers)
I do it more than the music

Mo City niggas is actors
They need to quit rapping and playing the movie (Playing the movie)
Mo City niggas is actors
They need to quit rapping and playing the movie (Playing the movie)
We use our iPhone for practice
'Cause she 'bout that action, we making a movie (Making a movie)
Some of your friends go through your pictures (Hey)
They see me give you the business

Face it, I'm so far ahead of your average nigga (So far ahead of your average nigga)
I roll a gram and a half of the gas in the swishers (Rolling a half of the gas in the swishers)
I'm done with my cup, somebody pass me the liquor
And she go to work, she got an ass like a stripper (Damn)
She call me shark, she say she in love with the coco (Coco)
And they like to gossip and I am in love with the promo (Promo)
So keep on promoting, you know that we need the promotion (Need the promotion)
Getting massages, she rubbing on me with the lotion (Rubbing on me with the lotion)
Then I get inside her, she told me go deep in the stroker (Go deep in the stroker)
She told me she love me, I act like I didn't even notice (That's fucked up)

I'm no good
I am no good, baby
No good, no good, no good
Keeping it real with you baby
No good, no good, no good

I can't even act like a nigga ain't feeling you
I got to keep it a hundred (A hundred)
This industry make me feel like I am invisible
I'm out here drinking in public (Public)
The way that I make my decisions is critical
Sorry if a nigga ever offended you
She know that's part of the song, she gon' pull out her phone
She gon' sing it alone

Mo City niggas is actors
They need to quit rapping and playing the movie (Playing the movie)
Mo City niggas is actors
They need to quit rapping and playing the movie (Playing the movie)
We use our iPhone for practice
'Cause she 'bout that action, we making a movie (Making a movie)
Some of your friends go through your pictures (Hey)
They see me give you the business

Huh, huh
I'm often distracted
I don't know what rapping or trapping, my passion
I don't want no action, I don't want no problems
I just want a mansion, I just want some commas
I just want a million, give it to my mama
I just want my niggas living like Obama
We were presidential, I don't got a Rollie
I got some bitches, yeah I got a moment
I don't want no issues, I just want some money
I could drive the ticket, neighborhood would love me
Tell 'em could and get it, I'ma keep it coming
Pull up in a foreign, yeah I really get it
Money in the Civic, yeah, I'm really listening
Sleeping in the condo, yeah I know the feeling
Boys are trapping, I won't be that nigga
If I wasn't rapping, prolly be in prison
If I was an actor, Charlotte would have killed me

If I was an actor, Charlotte would have killed me
If I was an actor, Charlotte would have killed me
Yeah, yeah, ayy
