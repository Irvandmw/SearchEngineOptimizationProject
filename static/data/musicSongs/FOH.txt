Lyrics:


It's been 37 hours, 7 minutes, 30 seconds
And you still haven't responded to me
Got me on the edge of crazy
But I'm not one for complaining
I just wonder where the hell you could be

Tell me who you think you are
Don't be playing with my heart
Say what, what's it gonna be

'Cause I'm in love with you now
Are you in, are you out
'Cause I really need you here
If you don't want me around
Then don't come around
And cloud up my atmosphere
Fuck outta here

It's been 47 hours, 7 minutes, 30 seconds
And now you're just responding to me
Boy you must be suicidal
Is that bitch right there beside you
'Cause I know hell it couldn't be me

Tell me who you think you are
I'm a motherfucking star
Say what, what's it gonna be

'Cause I'm in love with you now
Are you in, are you out
'Cause I really need you here
If you don't want me around
Then don't come around
And cloud up my atmosphere
Fuck outta here

If you ain't feeling this just let me know
I promise on everything I'll let you go

'Cause I'm in love with you now
Are you in, are you out
'Cause I really need you here
If you don't want me around
Then don't come around
And cloud up my atmosphere
Fuck outta here
Fuck outta here
