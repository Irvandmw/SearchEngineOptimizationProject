I been trying all my life
To separate the time (Hey)

Stuck between the having it all

[English translation:]

[Halsey:]
I've been trying all my life
To separate the time
In between the having it all
And giving it up, yeah

[SUGA:]
This wandering, with only blueness inside my head
Self-loathing and pride live in my heart
I was full of dreams, then I grew and made all of it come true
Yet keeping dreams as dreams would be better
I thought, while living at the same time
May my leap not be a fall
Your convictions, efforts, faith, and greeds
It is not of ugliness, I believe it, ey
The dawn before sunrise is darker than anything
But never forget the stars you hope for only appear in the dark

[Halsey:]
I been trying all my life
To separate the time
In between the having it all
And giving it up, yeah (Hey)
I wonder what's in store
If I don't love it anymore (Hey)
Step between the having it all
And giving it up, yeah (Hey)

[SUGA:]
Sometimes I don't know if I'm really walking
If I ceaselessly run towards the end of the tunnel
What else there would be?
Is it even right? It's honestly different to the future I had hoped for
It doesn't matter, now it's a matter of survival
However it goes, it doesn't matter, yeah yeah
It may be different to what you were hoping for
How you live on and how you love might change
That's true (That's true, that's true)
(Yeah) Yeah, so, are you gonna move?
We are too young to be hesitating, just run head-on onto it
So what you gonna do?

[Halsey:]
I been trying all my life
To separate the time (Hey)
In between the having it all
And giving it up, yeah (Hey)
I wonder what's in store
If I don't love it anymore (Hey)
Step between the having it all
And giving it up, yeah
