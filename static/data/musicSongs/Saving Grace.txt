Lyrics:


When you're out in the open
And you're tired of hoping
I'll be there in a moment
I'll be by your side
When you're scared and you're lonely
When there's no one to hold you
I just want you to know that
I'll be by your side

You keep me strong when I can't carry on

When you lose your feet, fall down to your knees and your heart's about to break
I will be your saving grace
When your eyes can't see, take my eyes from me
When you're lost and losing faith
I will be your saving grace

Be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace

When my heart's getting older
And my body is breaking down
In my head yeah I know that I'll be by your side
I don't know about the future
No one knows what the future holds
All I know is I know that I'm giving you my life

You keep me strong when I can't carry on

When you lose your feet, fall down to your knees and your heart's about to break
I will be your saving grace
When your eyes can't see, take my eyes from me
When you're lost and losing faith
I will be your saving grace

You keep me strong when I can't carry on

When you lose your feet, fall down to your knees and your heart's about to break
I will be your saving grace
When your eyes can't see, take my eyes from me
When you're lost and losing faith
I will be your saving grace

Be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace
