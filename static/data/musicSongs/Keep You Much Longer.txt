Lyrics:


Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you're too busy for me, girl, like I was to you

Wish I could stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

Wish I could just stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

The tables have turned
And I've finally learned
That this is making up for every day I was gone
And that's why I'm concerned
But now it's confirmed
That you spread your wings and learned to fly but all alone

Darkness in the night
I'll find that light for you
As long as I got eyes
I'll have a sight for you
Long as I am alive
Baby, I'd die for you
Wanna be with you

Wish I could keep you much longer
Keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Keep you much longer
Now you're too busy for me, girl, like I was to you

Wish I could stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

Wish I could just stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

You're always on my mind
While I'm racing
While I'm paper-chasing
You were there when I said one day
I'd get up out that basement
Playing as my agent
For you there's no replacement
You will always be my girl
And you can hold me on that statement

Darkness in the night
I'll find that light for you
For as long as I got eyes
I'll have a sight for you
Long as I am alive
Baby, I'd die for you
Wanna be with you

Wish I could keep you much longer
Keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Keep you much longer
Now you're too busy for me, girl, like I was to you

Wish I could stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

Wish I could just stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

Baby, I know you
And how we do
Doing exactly what I taught you
Gotta get that money first
Before you come spend that precious time with your boo
And I know I gotta just take it
Even though it's driving me crazy
Always wanted to see my girl make it

Wish I could keep you much longer
Keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Keep you much longer
I wish I wish I could keep you so much longer
Now you're too busy for me, girl, like I was to you

'Cause I wish I could stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

Wish I could just stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

Wish I could keep you much longer
Keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Keep you much longer
Wish I could keep you, baby
Now you're too busy for me, girl, like I was to you

I just wanna keep you longer

Wish I could stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

I just wanna keep you longer

Wish I could just stop by
And maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by
And lay by your side

I just wanna keep you longer
I just wanna keep you longer
