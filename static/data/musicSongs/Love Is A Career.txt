Lyrics:


(Career career love is a career)
(Career career love is a career)
Always sent her flowers (career career love is a career)
Hold her hand for hours (career career love is a career)
Warm and sentimentally (career career love is a career)
Always sigh when she is near 'cause love is a career (career career love is a career)

Every time you dine her (career career love is a career)
Candle light and wine her (career career love is a career)
Make it like romancing (career career love is a career)
When you take her dancing (career career love is a career)
Whisper things in her ear 'cause love is a career (career career)

That million I guess proves you're a success but proves a whole lot more
So mister just close that store and write down loving on the door
(Career career love is a career)
No two ways about it (career career love is a career)
What's the world without it (career career love is a career)
Stand right up and shout it (career career love is a career)
From roofs above (career career love is a career)
Life will glow like a chandelier
If you make a career of love
(career career love is a career career career love is a career)
Of love
