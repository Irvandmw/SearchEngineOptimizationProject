Lyrics:


You wanna get it on right now I see
I just wanna say that's cool with me
But now the moment's come
I've never been good at this temptation 

From the first time it felt so right
I knew that right here is where I belonged
With that black dress I have to confess
My intentions may have been wrong 

(Hold on) this ain't the right time
(You know) there's doubt in my mind
(Don't want) to rush this baby, one night's not my style 

You wanna get it on right now I see
I just wanna say that's cool with me
Won't you take your time
Leave it just a little to imagination
I've been waiting for this night so long
And it's been really hard just holding on
And now the moment's come
I've never been good at this temptation 

This temptation
Oh this temptation
This temptation
I've never been good at this temptation 

Every night, you've been on my mind
Could you be the one I've been waiting for?
'Cos your sweetest kiss,
Oh I just can't resist
That's the kind of thing you've got me beggin' for more 

(Hold on) this ain't the right time
(You know) there's doubt in my mind 
(Don't want) to rush this baby
One night's not my style 

You wanna get it on right now I see
I just wanna say that's cool with me
Won't you take your time
Leave it just a little to imagination
I've been waiting for this night so long
And it's been really hard just holding on
And now the moment's come
I've never been good at this temptation 

I know that we've both been here before
That's why I really wanna be sure
But now that the moment's here
I've never been too good at this temptation 

You wanna get it on right now I see
I just wanna say that's cool with me
Won't you take your time
Leave it just a little to imagination
I've been waiting for this night so long
And it's been really hard just holding on
And now the moment's come
I've never been good at this temptation 

So long
Get it on
Never been good at this temptation 

You wanna get it on right now I see
I just wanna say that's cool with me
Won't you take your time
Leave it just a little to imagination
I've been waiting for this night so long
And it's been really hard just holding on
And now the moment's come
I've never been good at this temptation
