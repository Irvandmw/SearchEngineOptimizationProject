Lyrics:


Oh, huh, oh, huh, oh, huh, oh
Mmm, huh, oh, It's me

Oh, I love the way she say that pussy mine
Oh, I work that pussy out like nine to five
Oh, can't get that pussy off of my mind
Oh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind

(Oh yeah) Pussy, pussy, twist your leg
(Oh yeah) Break it, break it, break your neck
(Oh yeah) I'm a dog (woof), what'd you expect?
Oh, I'mma make you sweat
Oh, I'mma wreak myself
Oh God, what's that?
Got your feet up by your neck
Never break up, but I fuck you like it's make-up sex
You go run and tell all your friends my dick the best
Like a waterfall, the way I keep the pussy wet (wet)
Wet (wet), wet, fuck your ex
Oh, yeah, bring the tray
Ice cream pinch up on your chest
Oh yeah, don't take your test
We gon' have a fuck fest
(Oh) you're a dirty bitch
That's some shit I never guess
(Oh) we gon' make a mess
Fucking up your mattress

Oh, I love the way she say that pussy mine
Oh, I work that pussy out like nine to five
Oh, can't get that pussy off of my mind
Oh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind

Oh, oh, oh, I love the way she say that pussy mine
Oh, oh, oh, I work that pussy out like nine to five
Oh, oh, oh, can't get that pussy off of my mind
Oh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind

Oh yeah, switching positions
We might not ever finish
Oh yeah, our sex the illest
That why we need a witness
Oh yeah, look at me hit it
While you rub on your clitoris
I play you the shit
The way you whipping that wrist
Got my hands on your hips
You all on top of my dick
That shit so tight I didn't think it could fit
Got a little waist, but that ass so thick
She got a pretty face but she fuck me like a freaky little bitch
Make me wanna throw a tip when she drop it to the floor
Can't believe she didn't strip
I'mma need a lil' more
Make you do a back flip
I'mma fuck her till she's sore
I'mma pimp without a limb, ay get it B

I love the way she say that pussy mine
Oh, I work that pussy out like nine to five
Oh, can't get that pussy off of my mind
Oh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind

Oh, oh, oh, I love the way she say that pussy mine
Oh, oh, oh, I work that pussy out like nine to five
Oh, oh, oh, can't get that pussy off of my mind
Oh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind

Uh, huh, oh, huh, uh
Huh, oh, huh, oh, mhmm
