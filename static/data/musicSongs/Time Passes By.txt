Lyrics:


Oh-oh
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo

I'm sitting here alone again
Waiting for you to come see me now
As time passes by
In the blink of an eye
I know I'll get to see you somehow

You are sitting home another night
Waiting for someone to hold you tight
Time passes by
So quick indeed
This time you're slipping away from me

It's been a long, cold, hard winter
It was a long, drawn-out spring
I took no wrong when you saw nothing in me
But our love was something nice to see

We were sitting alone on the beach
Letting all the sand between our feet
As time passes by
Blink of an eye
Amazing how things ain't what they used to be
Ain't what they used to be...

It was the shortest summer
The fall was so abrupt
Thought you'd be happy with the way things were
But I guess it wasn't enough

I am outside sitting, writing this song
You could have guessed that all along
Time passed me by
So quick indeed
And you're the thing that I'm missing

I wrote this song all last night
Tried to make the lyrics fit just right
But I'm stilling having trouble with this very last part
But I know it'll come from my heart
But I know it'll come from my heart...

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
