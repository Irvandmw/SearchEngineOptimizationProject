Lyrics:


Just another day taken away, back to moonlight
Tired of the same shadows and silhouettes
Before the dawn starts breakin' on the horizon
Once I'm closer to somethin' I don't have yet

I'll keep reachin' as far as I can till break of day
I'll keep reachin', the light of my life will find it's way
I know if I reach too far I may not ever recover
But I know the stars ain't all I'm meant to discover
So I'll keep reachin'

While you're fast asleep counting your sheep, I'm moon breathin'
I'll be up all night playin' through this twilight dream
'Cause all my life I have been patiently waitin'
But lights are dim to fulfill my destiny

I'll keep reachin' as far as I can till break of day
I'll keep reachin', the light of my life will find it's way
I know if I reach too far I may not ever recover
But I know the stars ain't all I'm meant to discover
So I'll keep reachin'
