Lyrics:


All this talk of getting old,
it's getting me down my love.
Like a cat in a bag waiting to drown.
This time I'm goin down.

And I hope your thinkin of me,
as you lay down on your side.
The drugs don't work they just make you worse
but I know I'll see your face again.

and I know I'm on a losing streak,
as I passed down by your street.
and if you want a show, just let me know
and I'll sing in your ear again.

Well drugs don't work,
they just make you worse
but I know ill see your face again

Cuz baby, ooh if heaven calls,
I'm coming too
just like you said, if you leave my life
I'm better off dead

all this talk of getting old,
its getting me down my love
like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown
this time I'm goin down.

cuz baby, ooh if heaven calls,
I'm coming too.
just like you said, if you leave my life
I'm better off dead.

now drugs don't work,
they just make you worse
but I know I'll see your face again

no the drugs don't work,
they just make you worse
but I know I'll see your face again

no the drugs don't work,
they just make you worse
but I know I'll see your face again
