Lyrics:


From January to March I'll tell the world
The icy winds make me cry
From April Fools Day to June I'll tell the world
My tears are rain - Oh, what I lie

I just can't tell the world
I can't tell them that I've lost you
Oh, no I can't
'Cause I can't break the news to myself

Oh, no, no, no 
Oh, no, no, no 
Oh, no, no, no 

From July to September I'll tell the world
The burning sun has me down
From October thru December I'll tell the world
We don't date 'cause I'm snow bound

No, I can't tell the world
I can't tell them that I've lost you
Oh no, I can't
'Cause I can't break the news to myself

No, I can't
No, I can't

Oh, no, no, no 
Oh, no, no, no 
Oh, no, no, no 

No, I can't tell the world
I can't tell them that I've lost you
Oh no, I can't
'Cause I can't break the news to myself
