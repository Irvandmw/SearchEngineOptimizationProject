Lyrics:


Here comes Mary, girls well now you better just tight your love
She don't pull any arrows at untouched men
It don't matter too much that it hurts, so you better know what's worth
Here comes Mary, girls just turn your back and then
She is heeled in flash to hurt, it's all a game
She's willing into walk away

(And the boys say)
Mary goes round (and the girls say)
Mary goes round (round round)
Mary goes round (and the girls say)
Mary goes round (round round)
(Turn a corner right, turn a corner left, step by step)

Mary had a little lamb, his fleece was white as snow
Mother's help but there is a little angel
And everywhere she went, ah ah, the men was sure to go
There is just another walk for danger
Don't let her get too close, or you've left one more part
To Mary steal a broken heart

Mary goes round (and the girls say)
Mary goes round (round round)
Mary goes round, oh (and the girls say)
Mary goes round (round round)

Don't let her get too close, or you've left one more part
To Mary steal a broken heart, ooh, oh oh

Mary goes round (na na na na na)
Mary goes round (round round)
Mary goes round, I've got to say it (na na na na na)
Mary goes round (round round)
Mary goes round (na na na na na)

Oh, you've got to slow your own up to the dawn (round round)
Party time, ooh, your party it's so, talking, talking
Party time, you've got to slow your own up to the dawn
Mary goes round, oh oh oh (na na na na na)
Mary goes round
