Lyrics:


I'm dreaming of Hawaii, 
Where perfume fills the air. 
And lovely gentle breezes, 
Come and take away your every care. 

The beauty of Hawaii, 
Is waiting just for you. 
Let's fly there on a rainbow, 
And let all our wildest dreams come true. 

Palm trees are swayin' 
Ukuleles are playin' 
Your heart will keep sayin' 
I've found a new home! 

The trade winds seem to say, 
We hope you'll stay, 
It's here you'll find that longed for peace of mind... 

There's romance in Hawaii, 
It's heaven by the sea. 
I'm dreaming of Hawaii, 
It's a paradise for you and me! 

Let's fly there on a rainbow, 
And may all our wildest dreams come true. 

Palm trees are swayin' 
Ukuleles are playin' 
Your heart will keep sayin' 
I've found a new home! 

The trade winds seem to say, 
We hope you'll stay... 
And it's here you'll find  
that longed for peace of mind... 

There's romance in Hawaii, 
It's heaven by the sea. 
I'm dreaming of Hawaii, 
It's a paradise for you and me!
