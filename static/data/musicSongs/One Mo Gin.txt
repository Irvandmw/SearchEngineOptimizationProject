[Verse 1 :]
Baby I been throwing hints around it
(Iâve been trying to get you)
Trying to get you to talk about it
(What do I gotta do to)
To get you to see (see)
Them other dudes
(They ainât me)
Donât wanna show you the same thing you already seen
I know you got another try in ya
Oh baby

[Chorus:]
Oh baby (oh baby)
Girl I know yo other man must of hurt you so baby (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Why you got me on hold baby 
Can you just give me the chance
I shoulda had b4 baby
Give it a chance girl one mo gin

[Verse 2:]
Whatever happened b4 you had me gurl that donât matter kno mo
And I donât wanna lie and say Iâma take it away
When I know I want
Girl I know I can make you forget about
I can show you how to live 
(live without it)
I go hard in the pain
Girl it ainât what you thank
Please believe it I can do it (oh baby)

[Chorus:]
Oh baby (oh baby)
Girl I know yo other man must of hurt you so baby (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Why you got me on hold baby 
Can you just give me the chance

Give it a chance girl one mo gin

[Hook:]
I know you heard it all b4 so

And If you let it flow

And make you see

Oh baby

[Chorus: (X2)]
Oh baby (oh baby)

Why you got me on hold baby
