Lyrics:


You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out
I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow
Luckily I can read your mind
Flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down
They will not cast you out, out.

Dear friend, here we are again pretending
To understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're gonna do
So try to love me and I'll try to save you.

[2x]
Won't you stay alive
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely.

Your redemption won't grow stale
We are now just setting sail
On the seas of what we fear
Treason now is growing near to me

I'm coming clean
God, hit me straight on. [2x]

[2x]
Won't you stay alive
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely.

[New version's addition:]
You say things with your mouth,
Cobwebs and flies come out.
I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow
Luckily, I can read your mind

[5x]
Don't be gone

[6x]
You say things with your mouth,
Cobwebs and flies come out.
