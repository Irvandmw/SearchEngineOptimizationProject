Lyrics:


Talkin loud and you sayin nothin
Talkin loud and you sayin nothin
Talkin loud and you sayin nothin

[Hook:]
Lot of yall talkin but yall really donât do it
Really donât do it, really donât do it
Lot of yall speakin but yall really donât do it
Really donât do it, really donât do it
A lot of yall leakin, man yall really donât do it
Really donât do it, really donât do it
You like to talk about it but you really donât do it
Really donât do it, let me show you how I do it
I do it, I do it, I do it
I do it, I do it, I do it
I do it, I did it, I do it
Talkin loud and you sayin nothing

I bought a Cadillac when I was 17 years old
With a fake ID up in my bill fold
Up out of high school shit about a year ago
If I donât get rich fuck bitch then itâs a miracle
Ready for this, ready for this
A whole life nigga, prepared for this
Iâm lookin through the mirrors of my eyelids
I never live in silence, Iâm flyin like a pilot
If the sea got though
He got flow, he like a tic-tac-ho
So all you bitches and you niggas say you knew that ho
Money bitches and weed is who I do this for

[Hook]

Jibba jabba, shit stack, donât matter
Nigga put yo muthafuckin gat up
Now knuckle up, we go fist to fist
Soon as you drop yo hip you gonna kiss the whip
Buy it real quick, not no affiliate
You see years ago I stopped doin silly shit
So I can climb the ladder of success at my best
Smoking everywhere I go and everyday Iâm in the press
Flyin in on the jet, hit the tarmac
In a whip that you can best bet
Iâm from the east side but the west is where I rest at
And if my hair wasnât locked up Iâd go and get a wet set

Talkin loud and you sayin nothing
Talkin loud and you sayin nothing
Talkin loud and you sayin nothing
Talkin loud and you sayin nothing

We about it, we about it
We about it, we about it
We about it, we about it
Donât talk that shit

We about it, we about it
We about it, we about it
We about it, we about it
Donât talk that shit

Cus youâll get fucked up quick
Get fucked up quick, get fucked up quick
Get fucked up quick
Donât talk that shit
Cus youâll get fucked up quick

[Hook]
