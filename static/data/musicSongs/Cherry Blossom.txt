Lyrics:


What you don't tell no one you can tell me
Little ghost tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave, and very free

I push you high
Cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

Swing it high like Jesus, loud and free
Dandelions in your hair, baby
You're very brave and there's much to see

I push you high
Cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

But when you're scared, I'll be right here
You feel afraid, hold me instead
It's a cruel cruel world
But we don't care
'Cause what we've got
We've got to share

What you don't tell no one you can tell me
Little ghost blonde hair with lemonade tea
There's much to learn and so much to see

I push you high
And you lean on
Your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one
You can tell me
