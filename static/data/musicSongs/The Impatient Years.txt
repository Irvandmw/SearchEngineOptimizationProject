Lyrics:


We're going through the impatient years
The years when the day seems twice as long
Restless and sighing and laughing and crying
And dreaming a dream people say is wrong

But we'll journey through
The impatient years
To each other's arms where we belong
Clinging together
I'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day
and impatient year

But we'll journey through
The impatient years
To each other's arms where we belong
Clinging together
I'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day
And impatient year
