Lyrics:


He's got the whole world, in His hands, 
He's got the whole wide world, in His hands, 
He's got the whole world, in His hands, 

He's got the whole world in His hands . . . 

He's got the little tiny baby, in His hands, 
He's got the little tiny baby, in His hands, 
He's got the little tiny baby, in His hands, 

He's got the whole world in His hands . . . 

He's got you and me brother, in His hands, 
He's got you and me sister, in His hands, 
He's got you and me brother, in His hands, 

He's got the whole world in His hands . . . 

He's got everybody here, in His hands, 
He's got everybody here, in His hands, 
He's got everybody here, in His hands, 

He's got the whole world in His hands . . . 

He's got the, whole world, in His hands, 
He's got the, whole world, in His hands, 
He's got the, whole world, in His hands, 

He's got the whole, 
World, 
In, 
His, 
Hands!
