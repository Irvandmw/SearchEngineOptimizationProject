Lyrics:


You're stuck in my head, stuck in my heart, stuck in my body, body
I wanna go, get out of here, I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you

This is the part, you've gotta say all that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, leaving tonight while everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Up in the clouds, high as a kite, over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try, when you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
And I wanna be there with you

Oh, baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Oh, baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Hold on to me
I never wanna let you go
Run away with me, run away with me
Over the weekend
We could turn the world to gold
Run away with me, run away with me

We could turn the world to gold
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold

Oh, my baby, take me to the feeling
Take me to, take me to it
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Just run away
Run away with me
With me

Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Run away with me
Run away with me

Run away with me
Run away with me
