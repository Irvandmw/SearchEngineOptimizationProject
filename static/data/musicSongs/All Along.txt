Lyrics:


Stranger in the mirror, I was just somebody else
Stumblin' through the night, so lost that I didn't even know myself
You came out of nowhere just in time
One more minute, I'd have lost my mind

And there was somethin' 'bout the way you looked at me
Shut the door on everything I used to be
I found myself in your arms
Now, I don't wanna know a world without your love
Nothin' but you could ever be enough, yeah
You were the one, you were the one all along

Think about the years I was livin', half asleep, yeah
Goin' through the motions, drownin' in an ocean
That felt forever deep
Yeah, and you came out of nowhere just in time (oh, just in time)
I was days away from goin' blind

And there was somethin' 'bout the way you looked at me
Shut the door on everything I used to be
I found myself in your arms (found myself in your arms)
Now, I don't wanna know a world without your love
Nothin' but you could ever be enough, yeah
You were the one, you were the one all along

It was always, it was always, it was always you
It was always, it was always, it was always you (it was always you)
It was always, it was always, it was always you (oh-whoa, yeah-yeah)
It was always, it was always, it was always you

And there was somethin' 'bout the way you looked at me ('bout the way)
Shut the door on everything I used to be
I found myself in your arms (found myself in your arms)
Now, I don't wanna know a world without your love
Nothin' but you could ever be enough, yeah
You were the one, you were the one all along (you were the one, yeah-yeah)

It was always, it was always, it was always you
It was always, it was always, it was always you
It was always, it was always, it was always you (it was always you)
It was always, it was always you
