Lyrics:


School days, school days
Dear ole golden rule days
Reading, writing and arithmetic
Were taught to the tune of
Tight skirts, big socks, pony tails and silk suit sales, now

Those really were the days, we had a lot of fun
And I remember that very special one
See him walking in the hall when classes would change
And I don't think he ever really knew my name

Ooh boy, school boy, ooh boy, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50's were done, now

With my bucks and checker boots I was really steppin' tough
With my fringed suede jacket I was just about tough enough, ya'll
But I couldn't get this guy to even look my way
Wonder what he looks like right now to this very day

Ooh boy, school boy, ooh boy, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50's were done, now

Art was my favorite class and I had to get a pass
To fool around in the hall, he was so cute and tall
I loved to race to lunch and science was more'n a hunch
Sure loved to go to gym, loved it when I saw him

We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50's were done, now

Remember those big hoop skirts and petticoats
That we wore in the summer, guess that's what I wore the most
And remember when you'd sit they'd fly up in the air
And you'd have to hold them down while sitting in your chair

Hoop skirts, petticoats, dirty sneakers
And blue jeans were cheaper
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50's were done, now
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50's were done, now
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on, coming on, coming on, yes, those were the days
That was the way things in the 50's were done, now

Oh, ain't you glad you made it
Oh, oh, ain't you glad you made it now
Oh, ain't you glad you made it
Ain't you glad you made it now, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ain't you glad you made it
Ain't you glad you made it, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ain't you glad you made it, oh, oh
Ain't you glad you made it, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't you glad you made it, yeah, yeah
Ain't you glad you made it, oh yeah
Ain't you glad you made it now, oh
Ain't you glad you made it
Ain't you glad you made it now
