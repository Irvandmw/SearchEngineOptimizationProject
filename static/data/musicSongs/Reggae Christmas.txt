Lyrics:


Every year I get the same feel
Christmas come I wanna pack my backs and flee
Wanna get away from New York
Wanna find another place to be

So we're having a reggae christmas
-down in Jamaica- we're having a good time too
Hey man, we're having a reggae Christmas
A merry Christmas and a reggae new year to you

Christmas is nice in Germany
If you like being up to your knees in snow
It's just as cold up in Canada

We gotta find another place to go
So...so we're having a reggae christmas
-down in Jamaica-
We're having a good time too
Hey man, we're having a reggae Christmas
Merry Christmas and a reggae new year to you.

And so now we're down in Kingston town
But I get that someday I know
Gonna meet my friends down in Kingston town
And those good times gonna rock
And those good times gonna roll

We're having a reggae Christmas
-down in Jamaica-
We're having a good time too
Hey man, we're having a reggae Christmas
A merry christmas and a reggae new year to you
We're having a reggae Christmas
-down in Jamaica-
We're having a good time too
Hey man, we're having reggae Christmas
A merry Christmas and a reggae new year
A merry Christmas and a reggae new year
A merry Christmas and a reggae new year to you
