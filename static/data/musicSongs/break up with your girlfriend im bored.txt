Lyrics:


You got me some type of way
Ain't used to feeling this way
I do not know what to say
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fucking look at your face
Now I wanna know how you taste
Usually don't give it away
But you know I'm out here thinking about it

Then I realized she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

Break up with your girlfriend
'Cause I'm bored
You can hit it in the morning
Like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care
Break up with your girlfriend
'Cause I'm bored

This shit always happens to me
Why can't we just play for keeps?
Practically on my knees
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doing to me
You're singing my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Acting all innocent, please
When I know you're out here thinking about it

Then you realized she's right there
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

Break up with your girlfriend
'Cause I'm bored
You can hit in the morning
Like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care
Break up with your girlfriend
'Cause I'm bored

Hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never really ever frickin' met you
You can say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (ain't nice)

Break up with your girlfriend
'Cause I'm bored
You can hit in the morning
Like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care
Break up with your girlfriend
'Cause I'm bored

With your girlfriend, girlfriend...
