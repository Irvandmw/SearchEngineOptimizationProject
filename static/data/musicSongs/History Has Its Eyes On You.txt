Lyrics:


Whoa...
Whoa... Oooh
Oo-oooh

I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men into a massacre
Witnessed their deaths firsthand
Oh, I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
Knowing history, history

History has its eyes on me
History, history, history, aaah
History has its eyes on me
History, history, history
Ahhh

Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
Don't nobody have control
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
History, history

History has its eyes on you
History, history, history, aaah
History has its eyes on you
History, history, history
Ahhh

Whoa...
Whoa... (whoa)
Whoa...

History has its eyes on you
History, history, history (whoa)
Aaah
History has its eyes on you (oooh)
History (ahhh)
History has its eyes on you (oooh, ooh)
History, history
Oooh, yeah
