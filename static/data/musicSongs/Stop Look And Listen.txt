Lyrics:


When I was a little bitty boy
Sittin' on my papa's knee
I still remember
Every word my papa said to me
Now boy if you ever meet
A pretty woman walkin' down the street
You'd better stop real still
Look both ways
Listen, or you'll get into trouble

When you see her go struttin' by
Givin' you that evil eye
If she's got a kind of dreamy look
Just enough to get you shook
Now boy, don't you lose your head
Pay attention (to) what your papa said
You'd better stop real still
Look both ways
Listen, or you'll get into trouble

She'll drive ya crazy with the way she walks
She'll drive ya crazy with the way she talks
And you'll think you're gonna lose your mind
because a pretty woman looks so fine
And the very first thing you know
You'll be tellin' her you love her, so
You'd better stop real still
Look both ways
Listen, or you'll get into trouble

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah....
