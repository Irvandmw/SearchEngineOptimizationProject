Lyrics:


Time waits for nobody
Time waits for nobody
We all must plan our hopes together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody

We might as well be deaf and dumb and blind
I know that sounds unkind
But it seems to me we've not listened to
Or spoken about it at all
The fact that time is running out for us all

Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no one
We've got to build this world together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Because time
It waits for nobody
Nobody

You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong
You know what's going on
And it seems to me we've not cared enough
Or confided in each other at all
It seems like we've all got our backs against the wall

Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no one
We've got to trust in one another
Or we'll have no more future at all
Because time
Waits for nobody

Waits for nobody
Time waits for no one
Let's learn to be friends with one another
Or there'll be no more future at all
Time waits for nobody

For nobody, nobody, nobody
For no one
