Lyrics:


Say you never send me away, making me a memory
And tellin me to find a life
Change, there's no changing what cannot be changed
And you are witness to a silent conversation
Nothing but the black of night
No one ever takes your place
Gotta let the pantomime play
Not to worry, my telepathy
I bring you into me there is no separation
And I tell you
I will climb inside your world
And all my history
Must revolve around this girl
And I can see you with my eyes closed
I can feel you when your near me
Just the knowing that you hear me
Could be you could measure my love
I can touch you with my hands tied
It don't take no extra feeling
Let your imagination just run
You can measure my love
And they tell you
They can stop those tears you cry
And we can ride that storm together
And all the love that lasts forever
And forever, and forever
Cling to the vine and the vine never breaks
It's a message from a ship to shore
For the soul and the sacrifice
Pain, there is no fury
Like a woman scorned
We could be victims of a lethal combinations
It's the hour, It's the sword that hides the stone
And one of us holds the power
There to forge our hearts together
Here forever and forever
