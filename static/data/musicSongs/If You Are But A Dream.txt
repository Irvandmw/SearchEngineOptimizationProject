Lyrics:


If you are but a dream
I hope I never waken,
It's more than I could bear
To find that I'm forsaken.

If youre a fantasy
Then I'm content to be
In love with lovely you,
And pray my dream comes true.

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare,
I'm so afraid that
You may vanish in the air,

So darling,
If our romance would break up,
I hope I never wake up,
If you are but a dream.
