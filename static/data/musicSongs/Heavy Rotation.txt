Lyrics:


Oh Jackie, you've got a lot to learn
I'm tired of bracing every bridge you break
Why, oh why?
Look at the lines on my face,
Open your arms, embrace me Jackie!

Jackie was the one, my beauty queen of every side
When she come to town, them boys were buzz around my hive
If you wanna taste the honey, then you better realize
You'll get stoned once or twice

All her friends are up on the west side,
Do you wanna go?
They've got songs in heavy rotation on the radio
She knows everybody no matter where she goes
She's got friends in heavy rotation on the radio

On a cold night she left me standing in the rain,
Beg you Jackie please tell me there's something I can say
Either roll with the palm trees, or get out of the way
That's what she said, never knowing, oh I could change
Where I'm going...

All her friends are up on the west side,
Do you wanna go?
They've got songs in heavy rotation on the radio
She knows everybody no matter where she goes,
She's got friends in heavy rotation on the radio!

You can try to get to know her
Just by reading all the writing on the wall
She's always right around the corner
She's got friends in heavy rotation on the radio!

You can try to get to know her
Just by reading all the writing on the wall
She's always right around the corner
All her friends are up on the west side,
Do you wanna go?
They've got songs in heavy rotation on the radio!
