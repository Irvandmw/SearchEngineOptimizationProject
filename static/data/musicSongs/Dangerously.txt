Lyrics:


This is gonna hurt
But I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off that love
It fucked my head up
There's no forgetting you

You've awoken me
But you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly
I've got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
I loved you dangerously

Usually I hold
The power with both
My hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now you're the train
And I'm tied to the track

You've awoken me
But you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly
I've got nothing left

'Cause I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know
There's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire
I'm gasoline

I love you, I love you, I love you

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh, baby, I loved you dangerously

Oh, I loved you dangerously
Oh, oh, I loved you dangerously
