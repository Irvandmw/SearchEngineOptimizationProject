Lyrics:


Tell me what we're doing here anyway
It seems like for too long we've been playing these games
When I reach out to touch you my hand starts to shake
'Cause it hurts to be this close but still so far away
It's like I'm in the shadow of his mistakes

But I've got a lifetime waiting for your heart to melt
'Cause baby can't you see it's me that you're damaging
I'm hoping in my heart, now I'm risking everything
So baby don't you leave me waiting in the wings

I know he hurt you but baby he ain't me
And I hope someday you'll find faith in me
I'm so desperate to touch you I'd do anything
Can't accept that my chances are slowly vanishing
As the lights go on and I take the stand
I gotta find the words to say

But I've got a lifetime waiting for your heart to melt
'Cause baby can't you see it's me that you're damaging
I'm hoping in my heart, now I'm risking everything
So baby don't you leave me waiting in the wings

But I've got a lifetime waiting for your heart to melt
'Cause baby can't you see it's me that you're damaging
I'm hoping in my heart, now I'm risking everything
So baby don't you leave me waiting in the wings

Ohhhh! ohhhh!

I'm hoping in my heart, now I'm risking everything
So baby don't you leave me waiting in the wings
