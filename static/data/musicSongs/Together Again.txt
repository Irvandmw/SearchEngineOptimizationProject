Lyrics:


Well, here we are after so many years
Together again, yes, we're together again
She's a superstar, ooh and it all gone far, yeah, yeah, yeah
Together again, we're together again

We've always held on to a little bit of each other
Together, together, oh
And we had to be more than friends
Because we're together again, yeah, yeah
Together, eh, eh... ooh, we're together

Together, forever, we're back together again
What a happy reunion, we're back together again

When I look into your eyes
I can see we were both so happy about it
And now we're together again, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, we're together again
And we were meant for each other
Ah, there ain't no doubt about it
Now we're together again, together, yeah

Together (we)
Forever (have come)
We're back together again (a long way, baby)
What a happy (we)
Reunion (have come)
We're back together again (a long way, baby)

Don't you know by now who you real love your heart?
Can you tell movies from start
You've tried the rest, now try the best
Oh yeah, let's put it to the test
And I love you, I love you, I love (I love you)
Ooh sugar, I love you so, yeah
Together (together)
Oh, we're together

Together, forever, we're back together again
What a happy reunion, we're back together again, oh yeah
Together, forever, we're back together again
What a happy reunion, we're back together again, oh, oh, oh
(Together) Together
(Forever) Together
(Together again) Together, together, oh yeah
(What a happy) Together
(Reunion) Together
(Together again) Together, together

I ain't, baby, no more, babe, together
I ain't going to weep no more, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Together, together, we're back together again, oh yeah
(Right here) Together
(Right now) Right now, right here
Together (right here)
Together, yeah (right now)
We're back together again (together again)
Together, together, together
