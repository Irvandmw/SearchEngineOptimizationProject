Lyrics:


Last night I drank too much
Don't know when enough's enough
Ended up on a roof downtown
Doing shots 'til the place shut down

Few missed calls on my phone
Don't know how I made it home
Woke up with a pounding head
All the sheets coming off my bed

This life got no escape
Go hard 'til I can't see straight
Sunlight burning my eyes
How the fuck am I still alive?

Oh, oh, oh
Man, I should be dead right now
Oh, oh, oh
Man, I should be dead right now
Dead right now
I should be dead

Last night meant nothing at all
I don't see it as a wake up call
Gonna do it all again tonight
Going out, getting myself right

This life got no escape
Go hard 'til I can't see straight
Sunlight burning my eyes
How the fuck am I still alive?

Oh, oh, oh
Man, I should be dead right now
Dead right now
I should be dead
Oh, oh, oh
Man, I should be dead right now
I should be dead right now
I should be dead

Running out of time
Running out of luck
I don't get it, what, can't you see?
Never giving up
Fill another cup
Gonna raise it up, toast to me!

Running out of time
Running out of luck
I don't get it, what, can't you see?
Never giving up
Fill another cup
Gonna raise it up, toast to me!

This life got no escape
Go hard 'til I can't see straight
Sunlight burning my eyes
How the fuck am I still alive?

Oh, oh, oh
Man, I should be dead right now
I should be dead right now
I should be dead
Oh, oh, oh
Man, I should be dead right now
I should be dead right now
I should be dead
Oh, oh, oh
Man, I should be dead right now
I should be dead right now
I should be dead
Oh, oh, oh
Man, I should be dead right now
I should be dead right now
I should be dead
