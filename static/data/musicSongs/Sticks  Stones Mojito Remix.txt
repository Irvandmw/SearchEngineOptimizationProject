Lyrics:


Shot down by your bullets
They shatter my faith and my bones
If you listen the words, they hurt, they creep
Right under my skin, they cut so deep

Can't you understand
I don't want battles, battles, battles
And if you lay them in my hand
I won't fight battles, battles, battles
Oh, tell me why
We work so hard to break these bones
Can we try
To lay down
These sticks and stones
Sticks and stones

We crash and fall together, so sad
We don't remember
Why we are tearing us apart
But I can feel the cracks, the cracks in my heart

Can't you understand
I don't want battles, battles, battles
And if you lay them in my hand
I won't fight battles, battles, battles
Oh, tell me why
We work so hard to break these bones
Can we try
To lay down
These sticks and stones
Sticks and stones
Sticks and stones
(Sticks and stones may break my bones, your words'll always hurt me)
Sticks and stones
(Sticks and stones may break my bones, your words'll always hurt me)

Why does it have to be so hard to surrender
When we got nothing left, nothing left to lose
Lose

Can't you understand
I don't want battles, battles, battles
And if you lay them in my hand
I won't fight battles, battles, battles
Oh, tell me why
We work so hard to break these bones
Can we try
To lay down
These sticks and stones
(Sticks and stones may break my bones, your words'll always hurt me)
Sticks and stones
(Sticks and stones may break my bones, your words'll always hurt me)
Sticks and stones
(Sticks and stones may break my bones, your words'll always hurt me)
Sticks and stones
(Sticks and stones may break my bones, your words'll always hurt me)

Sticks and stones may break my bones, your words'll always hurt me
