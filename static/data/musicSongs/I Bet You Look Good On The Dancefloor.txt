Lyrics:


Stop making the eyes at me,
I'll stop making the eyes at you.
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to

And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand 
And lighting a fuse might result in a bang b-b-bang-go

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or...
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984!

I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because it's sending me to despair,
Without a sound yeah you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair

That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand 
And lighting a fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-go

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or...
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984!

And no, there ain't no love, no Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets
Dirty dance floors, and dreams of naughtiness!

Well, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or...
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Said, from 1984!
