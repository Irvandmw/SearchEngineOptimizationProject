Lyrics:


I know the answers from the words of the prophet
I've seen the light through the fingers made of magic
I've seen an image of the future,
It's a vision and I know who you are

Go away can't you see you're not real
Open your eye some place far away
I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky
I've got my wings and I'm starting to fly

I met a poet tonight behind the masses
I sang a song about my many true addictions
I saw myself in a hole down below
And I know who you are

I'm alright though it's hard to feel
Open your eye some place far away
I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky
I've got my wings and I'm starting to fly

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

[2x]
Open your eyes
Look to the sky
Grab your wings
And then start to fly

[2x]
I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky
I've got my wings and I'm starting to fly

Yeah, oh, I'm starting to fly
Yeah, I'm starting to fly
Oh, I'm starting to fly
Yeah, I'm starting to fly, yeah

Starting to fly [3x]
