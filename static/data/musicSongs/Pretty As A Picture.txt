Lyrics:


You're as pretty as a picture
In your brand new evening gown
Within your eyes I see that starlight of old
With that smile a little bold
What a lovely lovely picture
You're my treasured work of art
And I'll always keep your picture
Locked in a room in my heart

You're as pretty as a picture
In your brand new evening gown
Within your eyes I see that starlight of old
With that smile a little bold
What a lovely lovely picture
You're my treasured work of art
And I'll always keep your picture
Locked in a room in my heart
