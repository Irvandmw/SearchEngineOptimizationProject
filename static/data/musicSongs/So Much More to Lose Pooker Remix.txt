Lyrics:


When you can smile, and you can cry
When there's no hope yet you find the will to try
Why should you fear, need to change
When people want you for who you are
And you can hurt so much it feels a burning scar
Why should you feel
Why should you feel the need to change

When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
There's always somebody waiting
To break your fall
To break your fall

When I can't see, I can't read
When I know love is living inside of me
Why should I feel the need to change
So I spend all my time
Looking for something else
But now it's clear to me
I've learnt my lesson oh so well
Why did I feel
Tell me why did I feel the need to change

When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
Just hold onto the branches [?]
Things we are
Just hold onto the branches [?]

When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
Just hold onto the branches [?]
Things we are
Things we are
Things we are
Things we are
