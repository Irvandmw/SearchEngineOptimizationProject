Lyrics:


Hold on
I thought that I could take it from here
Oh I thought that I was calm in the clear
Now it's getting harder
Hold on
I thought that I was doing so well
Oh like everything was under a spell
Now it's getting harder

I never loved you fully in the way I could
I fought the current running just the way you would
And now I'm in the creek
And it's getting harder
I'm like fallingwater

Go on
And tell me just what I'm supposed to say
As if it could be any other way
Oh it's getting louder
Go on
And tell me just how I could allow
All that's light to end up somehow
Where it's getting darker

I never loved you fully in the way I could
I fought the current running just the way you would
And now I'm stuck upstream
And it's getting harder
I'm like fallingwater

Fallingwater
Fallingwater

And I'm like fallingwater
Set me free
You were like fallingwater
Coming down on me

I never loved you fully in the way I could
I fought the current running just the way you would
And now I'm in the creek
I never gave you everything I wish I could
I should have seen it coming from the way you stood
But now I'm in the creek
And it's getting harder

And it was coming down on me
When I was standing in the creek
I'm like fallingwater
