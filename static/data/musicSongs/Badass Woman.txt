Lyrics:


I'm a badass woman (Ooh)
What's wrong with that?
Can't hold me back
Yeah, I'm a badass woman
Just made like that
But I'm proud of that
'Cause I'm a badass woman

Never second guess me
'Cause, baby, I'm the boss
Don't underestimate me
'Cause I'm the one in charge

I am smarter than you give me credit for
And I'm way stronger than I ever been before
I'm a force of nature that you can't ignore
You can't ignore, you can't ignore no more

I'm a badass woman (Ooh)
What's wrong with that?
Can't hold me back
Yeah, I'm a badass woman
Just made like that
But I'm proud of that
'Cause I'm a badass woman

Never saying sorry
For saying what's on my mind (On my mind)
And I don't need a body
To prove I'm worth your time (Time)

Oh, I am smarter than you give me credit for
And I'm way stronger than I ever been before
Oh, I'm a force of nature that you can't ignore
You can't ignore, you can't ignore no more

'Cause I'm a badass woman (Ooh)
What's wrong with that?
Can't hold me back
Yeah, I'm a badass woman (I'm bad)
Just made like that (Uh-huh)
But I'm proud of that (Yeah)
'Cause I'm a badass woman
'Cause I'm a badass woman

I am smarter than you give me credit for
And I'm way stronger than I ever been before
Oh, I'm a force of nature that you can't ignore
You can't ignore, you can't ignore no more

I'm a badass woman (Ooh)
What's wrong with that?
Can't hold me back (Oh-oh)
Yeah, I'm a badass woman (Ooh)
What's wrong with that?
Can't hold me back
Yeah, I'm a badass woman (Ooh)
Just made like that
But I'm proud of that
'Cause I'm a badass woman

I'm way smarter than you give me credit for
And I'm way stronger than I ever been before
Oh, I'm a force of nature that you can't ignore
You can't ignore, you can't ignore no more
'Cause I'm a badass woman
I'm a force of nature that you can't ignore
You can't ignore, you can't ignore no more
'Cause I'm a badass woman
