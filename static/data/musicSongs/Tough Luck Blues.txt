Lyrics:


It's too bad
Things are going so tough with me
It's too bad
Things are going so tough with me
I'm blue and disgusted
As any poor man could be

I used to have a car
And it was painted white and black
I used to have a car
And it was painted white and black
I couldn't keep up the payments
And the man, he took it back

I used to smoke cigars
The very best in town
But bad luck and trouble
Is bound to tear me down

It's too bad
Things are going so tough with me
I'm blue and disgusted
As any poor man could be

The woman that I'm lovin'
Is followed me all around
I can tell by her action
She's 'bout to put me down

It's too bad
Things are going so tough with me
You've heard my story
Peoples, what'ch you think at me?
