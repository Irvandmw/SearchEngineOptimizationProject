Lyrics:


Ever homeward, ever homeward, yearns the weary rover,
Ever homeward, ever homeward, till the journey's over.
Warm embraces and friendly faces, saying welcome home,
Let me lie there 'neath the sky there, never more to roam.
Ever homeward, ever homeward, yearns the weary rover.
Ever homeward, ever homeward, now the journey's over.

Wolne serce, lekkÄ dusza, mam teÅ¼ dom mÃ³j blisko,
Jak dzieÅ spÅynÄÅ rok, bo blisko jest juÅ¼ me ognisko.
ChoÄ juÅ¼ obce co tam bÄdzie, serce do was pÅynie,
To jest dom mÃ³j, o nim ÅniÅem, zawsze tam z oddali.

Ever homeward, ever homeward, yearns the weary rover.
Ever homeward, ever homeward, now the journey's over.
