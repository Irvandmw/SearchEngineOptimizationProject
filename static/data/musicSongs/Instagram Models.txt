Lyrics:


(Oh) Iâm facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble  
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) Iâm going for throttle
(Oh) Oh these instagram models
(Oh) Are serving nothing but trouble

Sheâs leading me on the round 
Thatâs perfect but closing down 
Iâm crying day you gone 
Ain't taking it no more 
Ain't taking it no more 

Sheâs so good at playing cards
But the minute she brings you joy
Sheâll shows you the door
Ain't taking it no more
Ain't taking it no more

(Oh) Iâm facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble  
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) Iâm going for throttle
(Oh) Oh these instagram models
(Oh) Are serving nothing but trouble

Sheâs sick of waiting on her roof (UNKNOWN)
Now so tired of waiting her turn
And I ain't tryna go home 
Ain't taking this no more
Ain't taking it no more 

And I never believed it would actually happen
Your body so tempting, my sweetest distraction
Lets get down on the floor
Canât take this no more
Canât take this no more

(Oh) Iâm facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble  
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) Iâm going for throttle
(Oh) Oh these instagram models
(Oh) Are serving nothing but trouble

Heeeeey hey hey aye!
Heeeeey hey hey aye!
