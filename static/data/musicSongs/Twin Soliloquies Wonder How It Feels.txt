Artist: Frank Sinatra Lyrics
Song Name: Twin Soliloquies (Wonder How It Feels)
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


(Wonder how I feel living on a hill top,)
(Looking on an ocean, beautiful and still,)
This is what I need, this is what I've longed for,
Someone young and smiling, climbing up my hill.
(We are not alike, probably I'd bore him)
(He's a cautious Frenchman, I'm a little hick)
Younger men than I, officers and doctors,
Probably pursue her, she could have her pick.
(Wonder why I feel jittery and jumpy,)
(I'm like a schoolgirl waiting before a dance)
Can I ask her now, I am like a schoolboy,
What will be her answer, do I have a chance?
