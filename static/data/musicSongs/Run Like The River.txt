Lyrics:


You're allowed to feel however you feel
You don't always have to hide your tears
Even if today doesn't go your way
I bet I'll get ya smilin' ear to ear

(Whoo!)
Everybody has their days
I know we gon' be OK
You don't have to be afraid

When the rain falls down I promise I won't run
Run like the river
When the rain falls down I promise I won't run
Run like the river

I believe in you, you know what to do
Be the hero that's like no one else
You've been here before, closin' every door
Happiness is what you owe yourself

(Whoo!)
Everybody has their days
I know we gon' be OK
You don't have to be afraid

When the rain falls down I promise I won't run
Run like the river
When the rain falls down I promise I won't run
Run like the river

(When the rain) When the rain falls down I won't run
Run like the river
(When the rain) When the rain falls down I won't run
Run like the river

When the rain falls down I promise (Hey, everybody) I won't run
Run like the river (Come on!)
When the (When the rain falls down) rain falls down I promise I won't run
Run like the river

When the rain falls down I promise I won't run
Run like the river
When the rain falls down I promise I won't run
Run like the river

(When the rain) When the rain falls down I won't run
Run like the river
(When the rain) When the rain falls down I won't run
Run like the river
