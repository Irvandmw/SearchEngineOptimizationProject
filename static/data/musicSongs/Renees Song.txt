Lyrics:


There's a song I like to sing
It says your name, I love the ring
So come here
So come here

I may be broken by my past
But I know my worst days, they won't last
If you come here (Just come here)
(Come here, come here)
So come here (Oh will you)
Come here?

Oh isn't it beautiful
Watching the cards unfold
Oh I want you to come here (I want you to come here)
Oh I want you to come here (Touching you, loving you)
(Touching you, loving you)
(I've been touching you, loving you)
(Touching you, loving you)
(I've been)

There's a wind up in the north
It tells us love's our only source
So come here (Just come here)
(Come here, come here)
So come here (Oh will you come here?)
Oh will you come here? (Just come here)
(Come here, come here)
Just come here (Oh will you)
Come here?

Oh isn't it beautiful
Watching the cards unfold
Oh I want you to come here (I want you to come here)
Oh I want you to come here
Watching you dance tonight
So free and full of life
Oh I want you to come here (I want you to come here)
Oh I want you to come here
