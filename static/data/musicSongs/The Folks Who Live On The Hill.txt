Lyrics:


Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high 
You and I, shiny and new 
Cottage that two can fill 
And we'll be pleased to be called 
The folks who live on the hill 

Someday we may be adding a wing or two 
A thing or two 
We will make changes as any family will 
But we will always be called 
The folks who live on the hill 

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green 
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen 
And when our kids grow up and leave us 
We'll sit and look at that same old view 
Just we two, Darby and Joan 
Who used to be Jack and Jill 
The folks who like to be called 
What they have always been called 
The folks who live on the hill
The folks who live on the hill
The folks who live on the hill
The folks who live on the hill.
