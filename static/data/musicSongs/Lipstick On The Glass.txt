Lyrics:


How did we get to my place?
After last night I'm looking for steps to trace
All I know is we made love all over my place
And that's all I can remember but my condo give the play by play

It started when I seen all of the bottles of PatrÃ³n
Empty, obvious that something crazy here went on, sex was everywhere
Whipped cream all over the counter, but she's nowhere to be found
I took a look around but the only thing I found was

Lipstick on the glass
Cause we drank, got drunk, that night we lived it up
Yeah that night we did it up
And now the only trace I found was
Lipstick on the glass
Shot after shot we got hot, sipping we pour it up
Now all I got left is the
Lipstick on the glass

I can still smell your perfume in my home, I can still taste the sweetness of your touch
I should ask the neighbours, maybe they know
I know they heard us loving on the night before
I'm tryna find out where you are, hope you not very far, I gotta find you girl

Where we can have another night with all these bottles of PatrÃ³n
Empty, obvious that something crazy here went on, sex was everywhere
Whipped cream all over the counter, but she's nowhere to be found
I took a look around, that's when I saw that you left

Lipstick on the glass
Cause we drank, got drunk, that night we lived it up
Yeah that night we did it up
And now the only trace I found was
Lipstick on the glass
Shot after shot we got hot, sipping we pour it up
Now all I got left is the
Lipstick on the glass

Left her lipstick on the glass
She left her lipstick on the glass
Saying this the best night she ever had, lipstick on my glass
Saying call her ASAP, she'll be ready

Lipstick on the glass
Cause we drank, got drunk, that night we lived it up
Yeah that night we did it up
And now the only trace I found was
Lipstick on the glass
Shot after shot we got hot, sipping we pour it up
Now all I got left is the
Lipstick on the glass
