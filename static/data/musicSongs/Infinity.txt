Lyrics:


Why you mad? Talkin' 'bout you're mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
Thatâs your bag, yup, thatâs too bad
Show is over, you ainât gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy, you actin' so corny like Fritos
Wouldnât have none of that without me though
Ainât none of my business, it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game you're a free throw
It's nothing that you donât already know

[Chorus:]
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
Thereâs an end to infinity
To infinity

How I say this? Fact that you still exist
No disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is
Truthfully Iâm through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Ainât no compliments (duh)
Ainât no being friends (duh)
Ainât no false pretense (duh)
Ainât no make amends (duh)
Ainât no come agains (duh)
Thatâs the story, ainât no happy ends

[Chorus]

Is it lack of ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt this on your own?
Why you tryin' to play like youâre so grown?
Everything you own, boy, you still owe

[Chorus]

You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
