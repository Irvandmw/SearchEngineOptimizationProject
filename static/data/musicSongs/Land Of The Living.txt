Lyrics:


They won't leave you behind
But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would be wise for you to be in the room next time
(To join the land of the living)
And what if you fall?
Ain't it the falling that's the best part?
They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck

Do what you want
Not what you need
We cast a vote here and everyone agreed
So here's a thought
Let's plant a seed
You're in a rut
Take this literature to read

Can you tell me is there anybody in my home?
All that I do is listen
Can you tell me is there anybody in my home?
To join the land of the living

They won't leave you behind
But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would be wise for you to be in the room next time
(To join the land of the living)
And what if you fall?
Ain't it the falling that's the best part?
They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck

Will you admit
You never tried
You let the fear in and then it multiplied
You are a ghost
Personified
You're in a rut
Think today you'll stay inside

Can you tell me is there anybody on the phone?
All that I do is listen
Can you tell me is there anybody on the phone?
To join the land of the living

They won't leave you behind
But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would be wise for you to be in the room next time
(To join the land of the living)
And what if you fall?
Ain't it the falling that's the best part?
They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck
(To join the land of the living)

They won't leave you behind
But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would be wise for you to be in the room next time
(To join the land of the living)
And what if you fall?
Ain't it the falling that's the best part?
They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck
(To join the land of the living)

They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck
