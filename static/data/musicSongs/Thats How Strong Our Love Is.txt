Lyrics:


They said we couldn't make it
They said it wouldn't last
But look who's talkin' now
We had the last laugh

Yeah, we seen some fire
And we felt some pain
We been through the toughest times
And we'd do it all again

It's you and me against the world
Yeah!

That's how strong our love is
That's how strong our love is
Gonna tell everybody it's true
Yes, I do
That's how strong our love is
That's how strong our love is
Gonna tell everybody 'bout you
Yes, I do

Nobody believed
That we'd last this long
Nobody believed it
But we proved them wrong

And all the trouble and strife
That life sometimes brings
If we can get through this
We can get through anything

It's you and me against the world
Yeah!

That's how strong our love is
That's how strong our love is
Gonna tell everybody it's true
Yes, I do
That's how strong our love is
There's nothing I wouldn't give
To spend my life with you
Yes, it's true

You could be a million miles away
But I know it's gonna be just fine yeah
Gonna be just fine (It's gonna be just fine)
I think about you night and day
But there's nothing gonna change my mind
Nothing's gonna change my mind (Nothing's gonna change my mind)

That's how strong our love is
That's how strong our love is
Gonna tell everybody it's true
Yes, I do
That's how strong our love is (That's how strong our love is)
That's how strong our love is
Gonna tell everybody 'bout you
Yes, I do

That's how strong our love is
That's how strong our love is, yeah (That's how strong our love is)
Gonna tell everybody 'bout you
Tell everybody 'bout you
