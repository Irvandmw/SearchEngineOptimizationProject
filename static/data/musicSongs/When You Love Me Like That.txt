Lyrics:


My beautiful lover
I still remember you
We used to be young once
I loved you even then
I wanted to tell you
But I was just a little girl
But now you are mine, and
It's like we both have been
On Fantasy Island, together once gain
As long as you're where I am
There's nowhere better in the world

Oh honey, hold me tight
Make me believe in love tonight
And in the morning 
Wake me up while you whisper
Sweet words that I love

You turn me up you turn me up 
When you love me like that
You make a believer I have no doubt 
When you love me like that
The things that you do with love
I could never give it up
I just couldn't give it up

The things that excite me
You seem to know them all
You really must like me
Cause every time you call
You never stop saying
The prettiest of pretty words
Honey honey sweet baby
You always know just what to say when I'm afraid
You take me and hold (honey) and chase the blues away
And then you tell me the sweetest things I've ever heard

Oh no one loves like you
I dream about us all night through
And in the morning when we rise
I know that look of love's there in your eyes
Lost there in your eyes

Turn me up you turn me up 
When you love me like that
You make a believer I have no doubt 
When you love me like that
The things that you do with love
I could never give it up

When you love when you love when you love 
When you love me like that 
Couldn't give it up boy
When you love me like that
Calling your name
Oh when you love when you love when you love 
When you love me like that
I could never never never never never
