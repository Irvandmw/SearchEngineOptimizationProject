Lyrics:


This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out 'cause I'm dying for company

I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it
To the next level, baby

If you want this good ish
Sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind
Tonight

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waiting for?

Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark

You notice what I'm wearing,
I notice when you're staring
You know that I can take it,
To the next level, baby

Hotter than the A-list,
Next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind
Tonight

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waiting for?

See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends

See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancing 'til the world ends
