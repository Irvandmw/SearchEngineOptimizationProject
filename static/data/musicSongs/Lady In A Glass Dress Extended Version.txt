Lyrics:


Lady in a glass dress, I can see right through you
You act like you don't want this, but you know that you do
Since he broke your heart girl, you say you'll never love again
And you won't let it stop girl, but we know in the end

You still dream, dream
You still dream, dream
Baby, I can make your dreams come true
Oh, oh, my lady in the glass dress, oh, oh

I'm telling you I want you but you saying you don't care
Begging you to stay with me but you staying right there, I... When will you try?
I swear you being selfish girl you know that this ain't fair
Tell me that you wanna be alone when you go to bed tonight, you close your eyes

Girl, you still dream, dream
You still dream, dream
Baby, I can make your dreams come true
Oh, oh, lady in the glass dress

I see right through you
I see right through you

You still dream, dream
You still dream, dream
Baby, I can make your dreams come true
Oh, oh, my lady in the glass dress, oh, oh
