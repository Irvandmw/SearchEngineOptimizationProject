Lyrics:


You I love
The kind of passion you fashion cannot be explained
You I love
You're so appealing the feeling cannot be contained
And when I touch you
There's no denying the flying I do in to space
You're just too much you
The simple case is your face is the face of faces

You I need
Not only merely I'm clearly a person bereft
Yes indeed
I'd draw the curtain for certain if you ever left
And if I stammer
Forgive my grammar
You got me winging no wonder I'm singing
It's you I love

You I need
Not only merely I'm clearly a person bereft
Yes indeed
I'd draw the curtain for certain if you ever left
And if I stammer
It's 'cause I dig glamour
You got me winging no wonder I'm singing
It's you I love
It's you I love
It's you I love
