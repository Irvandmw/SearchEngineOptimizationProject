Lyrics:


You think youâre smart
I know youâre not
You think youâve got it
Well I think not
Your Gucci bag
Donât look too real
So you know how it is
But do you know how it feels?

Today youâre standing tall
But I know your heels are high
Pretty scent, I know it ainât Chanel no. 5
Eye on the prize, dressed up for the kill
Do you know how it feels?
Do you know how it feels?

Youâre just a fake
Youâre unreal
Name your price, make the deal
And you donât care what you take
Youâre a fake
Youâre just a fake and a fraud
A wannabe in Dior
And you have no heart to break
Youâre a fake

You think youâre sharp
You think youâre hot
Your made up face
Donât hide your spots
You drive around in hired wheels
So you know how it is
But you donât know how it feels

I wouldnât look so proud
You havenât got it all
You havenât got the heart
You havenât got the balls
Lost in your lies
In it for the thrill
Do you know how it feels?
Do you know how it feels?

When youâre a fake
Youâre unreal
Name your price, make the deal
And you donât care what you take

Youâre a fake
Youâre just a fake and a fraud
A wannabe in Dior
And you have no heart to break
Youâre a fake

(Fake) you think youâre cool
(We know youâre not)
You think youâve got it
(But we say not)
You drive around
(In hired wheels)
So you know how it is
But, do you know how it feels?
Woh-oh-oh-oh
Do you know how it feels?

Youâre just a fake
Youâre unreal
Name your price, make the deal
And you donât care what you take
Youâre a fake
Youâre just a fake and a fraud
A wannabe in Dior
And you have no heart to break
Youâre a fake
