Lyrics:


Well, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand.
Lord, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand.
Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell,
When all your love's in vain.
All my love is in vain.

When the train pulled up to the station,
I looked her in the eye.
When the train pulled up to the station,
I looked her in the eye.
I was lonesome, I felt so lonesome,
And I could not help but cry.
All my love is in vain.

Well, the train it left the station
With two lights on behind.
Well, the train it left the station
With two lights on behind.
Well, the blue light was my blues,
The red light was my mind.
All my love is in vain.

Oh oh,
Oh, Willie Mae.
Oh oh oh oh oh,
Oh, Willie Mae.
Oh oh oh oh oh,
Oh vee oh woe.
All my love is in vain.
