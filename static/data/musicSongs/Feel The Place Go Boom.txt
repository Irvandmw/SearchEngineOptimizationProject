Lyrics:


Feel the place go boom!
Turn up the volume!
G-C-U! We run this room,
Let's move! Competitions going under,
Fear the 'lopes, Hear the thunder!

Let's ride, It's raining salt and light,
Let's show 'em the pride of the purple and white,
Get loud! Where's that canyon crowd?
It's time to rumble, Welcome to the jungle

Welcome, to the main event,
The moment you've all been waiting for,
We came to turn the heat up,
So turn that beat up,
...'n' Let's show 'em how we run this floor!

Hey! Can ya feel it? Yeah!
If ya with me, Lopes in the air!
Hey! Are ya with me? Yeah!
Then stand up and shout it like ya just don't care!

BOOM!
Turn up the volume!
G-C-U! We run this room,
Let's move! Competitions going under,
Fear the 'lopes, Hear the thunder!

Let's ride, It's raining salt and light,
Let's show 'em the pride of the purple and white,
Get loud! Where's that canyon crowd?
It's time to rumble, Welcome to the jungle

I Believe i can be a world changer, and with that faith,
I believe, we can rearrange it,
All together, If we stand up,
And stay strong,
We'll move mountains, and be history makers with our song
And we don't tread lightly,
'Lopes together, 'Cause tonight's the night we stand,
It's time to get this started,
Give it to me one more time if ya want it

Hey! Can ya feel it? Yeah!
If ya with me, Lopes in the air!
Hey! Are ya with me? Yeah!
Then stand up and shout it like ya just don't care!

BOOM!
Turn up the volume!
G-C-U! We run this room,
Let's move! Competitions going under,
Fear the 'lopes, Hear the thunder!

Let's ride, It's raining salt and light,
Let's show 'em the pride of the purple and white,
Get loud! Where's that canyon crowd?
It's time to rumble, Welcome to the jungle

Can you feel it? Grand Canyon! Get ready! Let's go!

Feel the place go boom!
Turn up the volume!
G-C-U! We run this room,
Let's move! Competitions going under,
Fear the 'lopes, Hear the thunder!

Let's ride, It's raining salt and light,
Let's show 'em the pride of the purple and white,
Get loud! Where's that canyon crowd?
It's time to rumble, Welcome to the jungle

Fear the 'lopes, Hear the thunder! [x4]
