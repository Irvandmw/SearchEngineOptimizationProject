Lyrics:


A cynical mind 
Wonât help you through the night 
And it canât hold you up 
When youâre too tired to fight 

Where you didnât have the strength 
To look after yourself 
You find all that you need 
For somebody else 

But love can move mountains 
Love can move mountains 
Love can move mountains, yes it can 
Love can move mountains 

That impossible task 
Youâre thinking of 
Is one you can complete 
When youâre driven by love 

And the strength that you find 
Wonât go slipping away 
Once it enters your soul 
Itâs reborn every day 

Love can move mountains...

So if youâre lucky enough to live 
To see love come your way 
Be thankful every day 
That it stays 
Oh that it stays 

A cynical mind 
Wonât help you through the night 
And it canât hold you up 
When youâre too tired to fight 

But love can move mountains...
