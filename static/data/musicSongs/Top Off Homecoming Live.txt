Check this out
After BeyoncÃ© perform
After she done the dance
Coachella gotta rename Coachella
The Beychella
New name alert
Beychella

If y'all know this one
I want y'all to sing a long
And bop and bop, bop
(B, put the fuck boy on notice)

I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room
I break the internet, top two and I ain't number two
My body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat
Fuck it up and then leave
Come back, fuck it up and leave again
Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik
In the hood, hollerin', "Free Meek"
Two deep, it's just me and JAY
Just posted in them courtside seats
Woo! I'm like "hol' up"
Woo! I might roll up
If they're tryna party with the queen
They gon' have to sign a non-disclosure

I took the top off the Maybach, yeah
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach
Ayy, I took the top off of my Maybach, bitch
I took the top off of my Maybach, bitc
