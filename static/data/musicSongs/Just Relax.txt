Lyrics:


Just relax, baby let's don't fight
Everything's gonna be alright
Honey won't you hear my plea
And cuddle up real close to me

I wanna hold you, real tight
So I can kiss you just right
So baby won't you please be
A little nicer to me
And don't be nervous at a time like this
Love is something that we don't wanna miss

While the moon shines so bright
I wanna love you tonight
I need a true love so bad
It's something I've never had
So don't be nervous at a time like this
Love is something that we don't wanna miss, uh huh

Well just relax, baby let's don't fight
Everything's gonna be alright
Honey won't you hear my plea
And cuddle up real close to me

I want to thrill to your touch
Because I love you so much
You oughta know how I care
So baby won't you be fair
And don't be nervous at a time like this
Love is something that we don't wanna miss
Just relax, uh huh
