Lyrics:


Ohhhhhhhh
Ooohhhhhhhh

I don't know
Where this road is gonna go
It's gonna go
I'll be just fine
Taking my time
I'll take it slow
I'll take it slow

Cuz I don't want to miss this moment
And I can get it back when its over

I'm gonna push pause
Yeah I'm gonna time out
Plenty of time to figure it out
I'm gonna push pause
I'm gonna time out
Call a time out
Gonna push
Ooohhhh
Gonna push
Ooohhh

I hope some day
I will look back and say
"I had it all"
"I had it all"
Less work more fun
Spending more time with the ones I love
Oooh
Singing oohhh

Cuz I don't want to miss this moment
And I cant get it back when its over

I'm gonna push pause
Yeah I'm gonna time out
Plenty of time to figure it out
I'm gonna push pause
I'm gonna time out
Call a time out
Gonna push
Ooohhhh
Gonna push
Ooohhh

Time goes by too fast
Gotta try to make it all last
Gotta try to make my life better
Try to slow down and keep it all together
Take it day by day
Find myself along the way
Find myself along the way
Yeah
Yeah

Gonna push pause
Calling time out
Plenty of time to figure it out
Gonna push pause
Calling time out
Time out

I'm gonna push pause
I'm calling time out
Plenty of time to figure it out
I'm gonna push pause
Calling time out
Call a time out
Time out
Gonna push
Ohhhhh
Gonna push
Oooohhhhh
Time out time out
Ooohhh
Time out time out
Ooohhh
Ooohhh
Ooooooh
Ooooooohhh
Oooooohhhh
