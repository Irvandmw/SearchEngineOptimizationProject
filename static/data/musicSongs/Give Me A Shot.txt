Lyrics:


Iâm here, weâre fine
But I donât see no reason for you to beat you down
âCause you donât even let me get close enough to you
To show my love
I could be the one if you give me some of your time

I know that I will prove you wrong
And you will give me all your trust
Donât be shutting me down
Give me a chance to make you my girl

Knew when I seen her
That I had to meet her
This girlâs out for me though
But Iâm not like those other guys

I wanna hit it baby, I wanna hit it
But Iâm not like those other guys
All you have to do is let me show you show you
Just give me one shot

[Chorus:]
Girl cause you
Girl weâre more than fools
But Iâm a winner, so girl we never lose
Iâm not a quitter
I treat way better
âCause Iâm just tryna get a shot with you baby
Iâm just tryna get a shot with you baby
Girl I wanna make this work
Baby let me steal the keys to your heart
Girl give me a shot

Iâm a team player
If you say wait then Iâll slow up
All I wanna do is keep you from losing
Give me a shot and youâll fall in love

Baby Iâll bring you a championship if you let me be your boy girl
Iâll take you away from the same old thing
All you gotta do is give me your heart

Knew when I seen her
That I had to meet her
This girlâs out for me though
But Iâm not like those other guys

I wanna hit it baby, I wanna hit it
But Iâm not like those other guys
All you have to do is let me show you show you
Just give me one shot

[Chorus:]
Girl cause you
Girl weâre more than fools
But Iâm a winner, so girl we never lose
Iâm not a quitter
I treat way better
âCause Iâm just tryna get a shot with you baby
Iâm just tryna get a shot with you baby
Girl I wanna make this work
Baby let me steal the keys to your heart
Girl give me a shot

All I see is you, Iâm watching you moving on the floor
If I get playing hard to get, makes me want you more
Why donât you give me a try? Come to my table
Iâll pour you some champagne baby, youâve heard of Angel
The drinks are flowing like a river
I love the way the dress holds the curves on your finger
Thereâs a few girls hating on you âcause they jealous
They ainât getting any attention off any fellows
So you do you, yea thatâs alright
Youâre the type of girl that will make me stay up all night
I canât stop staring, I canât quit
Just give me one shot or Iâll hit the target

[Chorus:]
Girl cause you
Girl weâre more than fools
But Iâm a winner, so girl we never lose
Iâm not a quitter
I treat way better
âCause Iâm just tryna get a shot with you baby
Iâm just tryna get a shot with you baby
Girl I wanna make this work
Baby let me steal the keys to your heart
Girl give me a shot
