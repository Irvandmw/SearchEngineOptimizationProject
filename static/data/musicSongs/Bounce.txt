Lyrics:


We come rushing through your stereo system, into your ear canal, like the alignment of the solar system.
Have you forgotten about the days when we just wanted to rock cause we like it that way, and no more hate, no more lies, no more politics.
So sick of fakes who cry over copied riffs.
This is the day that we rise and we conquer it.
Raise your mics to the sky like apocalypse.

Everyone bounce, show me what it's all about, don't stand just bounce.
'Cause we're takin over now.
It's TFK, we rock the party, and keep the party jumpin in an old school way.

Situation restless, like someone tryin to sneak up on the guest list.
Let's play for a team that's called "not to mess with", and check out the scenario, let the sound ya hear, control your stereo. Turn it up and let the people know, I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go.
This is the day that we rise and we conquer it, raise our mics to the sky like apocalypse.

Everyone bounce, show me what it's all about, don't stand just bounce.
'Cause we're takin over now.
It's TFK, we rock the party, and keep the party jumpin in an old school way.
Bounce, show me what it's all about, don't talk, just bounce.
Get up and let it all hang out,
If you find it hard to breathe, ya better just leave,
We 'bout to make it hotter than the third degree.

Let's break this mold, can't let this hold us, let's be soldiers, no longer let them control us.
Boys and girls, together we'll shake the world, if you believe then out it to the sky with me.
If you agree there is more to this than what we see and what we know.
Then bounce 'til ya lose control, and grab a partner.
We about to make this hotter, turn up the heat while we get started.

The time has come now shake up the dust until it settles the sand.
Bounce, bounce! (wake up n')
Bounce! (stand up n'), let your spirit fly

Everyone bounce, show me what it's all about, don't stand just bounce.
'Cause we're takin over now.
It's TFK, we rock the party, and keep the party jumpin in an old school way.
Bounce, show me what it's all about, don't talk, just bounce.
Get up and let it all hang out,
If you find it hard to breathe, ya better just leave,
We 'bout to make it hotter than the third degree.
