Lyrics:


Diggin' slowly, flowers growing, beautiful from inside me, overlooking mispresentation of my
findings, how we gonna' come back to this? How we ever gonna' make a match to this?  Let's lay
low, like a mattress. They'll be another one after this.  

You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside of me. You could never fill these shoes,
cause I refuse to lose, I'm just ordinary me. You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside
of me.  You could never fill these shoes, cause I refuse to lose, I'm just ordinary me.

Diggin' slowly, flowers growing, beautiful from inside me, overlooking mispresentation of my
findings, how we gonna' come back to this? How we ever gonna' make a match to this? Let's lay
low, like a mattress. They'll be another one after this.  

You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside of me. You could never fill these shoes,
cause I refuse to lose, I'm just ordinary me. You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside
of me. I'm prepared to let this go to let everybody know im just ordinary

Growin' up as an adolescent, so full of these questions, got me second guessin'. My mind with
the message, and the mention of my progression, class is in session. How long will we all keep
guessin'? When you've never been, it's so evident from your grumbling. Man, I wonder when
we'll talk, if you wanna talk, take the mask off. We can rock, shake it off, shake it off,
shake it off. 

One - you can't make me feel this way, Two-you won't make me run away, you can't understand my
chemistry, so laugh it makes me ordinary.

You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside of me. You could never fill these shoes,
cause I refuse to lose, I'm just ordinary me. You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside
of me. I'm prepared to let this go to let everybody know im just ordinary

One - you can't make me feel this way, Two-you won't make me run away, you can't understand my
chemistry, so laugh it makes me ordinary. One -you can't make me feel this way, Two-you won't
make me run away, you can't understand my chemistry, so laugh it makes me ordinary.
