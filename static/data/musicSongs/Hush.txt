Lyrics:


You're nothing but a guy I know
Just a friend of a friend for show
Your innocence distracted me
Couple drinks got me flirty

But if you had a girlfriend, I think that I would know
We may have had that one night, let's keep it on the low
Don't memorize my number or keep me in your phone
Your kiss I can't remember, but everybody knows

So hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush

They talkin' like we broke the law
It's just your lips, well they caught my fall
And I didn't know you keep her close
I guess this is how it goes

But if she was your girlfriend, I think that I would know
Yeah, we had that one night, shoulda kept it on the low
Don't memorize my number or keep me in your phone
Your kiss I can't remember, but everybody knows

Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush

Yo, real talk, I don't want none of it
Just stop, 'cause I ain't got time for this
One simple mistake in one night
Two bottles of wine just to feel right
But I guess I'm messin' with the wrong guy
And now his ex is textin' him like, "Why
Why you gotta be kissin' on my good friends?"
I went and told him, yo this has gotta end

But if she was your girlfriend, I think that I would know
Yeah we had that one night, shoulda kept it on the low
Don't memorize my number or keep me in your phone
Your kiss I can't remember, but everybody knows

Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush
Huh-huh, baby just hush
Huh-huh, baby just, mhmm
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Hush, hush, ain't nobody gotta know
Huh-huh, baby just hush
