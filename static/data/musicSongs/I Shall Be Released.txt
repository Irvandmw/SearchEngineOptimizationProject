Song Name: I Shall Be Released
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


They say every man can be replaced
Say every distance is not real
That I can remember every face
Every man who's put me here

I've seen my life go shinin'
From the west down to the east
And any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
Say every man must fall
That I swear I see my reflection
We're so high above this wall

I've seen my life go shinin'
From the west down to the east
And any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
And he swears he's not to blame
All day I long I hear him cryin' out
That he was framed
I've seen my life go shinin'
From the west down to the east
And any day now, any day now
I shall be released
And any day now, any day now
I shall be released
