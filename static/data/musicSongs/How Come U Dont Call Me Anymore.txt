Lyrics:


I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong
I always thought you'd be by my side mama, now you're gone

What I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore, yeah?
Oh, anymore?

(Listen...)
I still light the fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you're holding me tight
(OK, now, umm...)
Everybody said, everybody said that we should never part, ooh yeah
(I always said that we were kinda cute together myself)
Tell me baby, baby, baby, why, why'd you wanna go and break my heart? (Why'd you wanna do it, baby?)

All I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore, yeah?
(Why don't you call me girl?
Oh yeah, oh yeah)

Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me mama, girl you gotta try
Down on my knees, beggin' you please, please, oh
Why can't you call me sometime, baby?
It's just one lousy dime, baby...
Why can't you call me sometime?
Oh, no no

Why on Earth can't you just pick up the phone, yeah?
You know I don't like to be alone
Why, why must you torture me baby?
Why you gotta treat me so bad?
