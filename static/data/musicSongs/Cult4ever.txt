Lyrics:


I could love you like forever
You can be my nigga 'til the day we both die
You keep me alive forever
And I don't want nobody else, a nigga won't lie
I could love you like forever
You can be my nigga 'til the day we both die
'Cause you keep me alive forever
And I can't tell a lie, so I won't lie

(Ooh) You don't gotta be the one that got away
(Ooh) I be ridin' with the car don't got a brake
(Ooh) Baby, you don't wanna see me goin' ape
(Ooh) It's some things that you don't ever gotta say
You can't fit those Louis trunks up in them Porsches
Girl, I do not believe in divorce
We ain't ridin' if the car don't got a horse
Kill 'em now, baby, I don't got remorse

You can love me, touch me
Drug me, fuck me up
Love me, numb me
Hope we don't sober up, hey

I could love you like forever
You can be my nigga 'til the day we both die
You keep me alive forever
And I don't want nobody else, a nigga won't lie
I could love you like forever
You can be my nigga 'til the day we both die
'Cause you keep me alive forever
And I can't tell a lie, so I won't lie

(Ooh) Ridin' shotty, girl, that's how I meditate
(Ooh) I don't gotta keep the money in a safe
(Ooh) Need it now, don't nobody wanna wait
(Ooh) Had it boomin' and it's not the 808
You got me tryna give emotion a try
I've never been like an emotional guy
I'm busy now, I'm gettin' lost in the high
And we both can deny, but we both can't deny it

You can love me, touch me
Drug me, fuck me up
Love me, numb me
Hope we don't sober up, hey

I could love you like forever
You can have me 'til the day we both die
You keep me alive forever
This is no lie, see, it ain't no lie
I could love you like forever
You can have me 'til the day we both die
You keep me alive forever
And you don't even know, but it's never no lie

And we don't even need nobody else
And we don't even need nobody else
I can have you like forever
You can love me 'til the day we both die
