Lyrics:


Slowly but surely you leave
Your mark on me
Silently stealing away
My sanity

'Cause I've been watching you right from the start
Standing so near can you hear my heart
Crying

Everyday
I keep on waiting for a chance to
Give it away
The love I save to you
Hard as I try
I'm getting closer but I can't get through

Swimming this river of doubt
On my own
Trying to read your mind
Are you feeling alone?

Baby the sun shining light in your eyes
Gives a feeling, I hope, never dies
Baby

Everyday
I keep on waiting for a chance to
Give it away
The love I save to you
Hard as I try
I'm getting closer but I can't get through

So little baby blue
Give me a clue
Tell me you need me too
It's now or never

You are on my mind
Give me a sign
Show me you wanna be together
Now and forever

Everyday
I keep on waiting for a chance to
Give it away
The love I save to you
Hard as I try
I'm getting closer but I can't get through
...
