Lyrics:


It's been too long
Since I've held you close
Since I've kissed your nose
It's been too long
Life on the road
Was always good to me
But without my baby
It ain't no life at all

Heaven knows you've been through more than enough
So I won't take my time, yeah I'll just do it right

If you keep the light on
So I can find my way
Yes I can find my way
A way back to you
If you keep the light on
So I can find my way
Yes I can find my way
A way back to you (back to you)

I've been so blue
I've been so lonely
With no one to hold me
I've been so blue
So wait by your window
Underneath the moonlight
Just after midnight
I'll be coming for you

Heaven knows you've been through more than enough
So I won't waste your time, I'll just do it right

If you keep the light on
So I can find my way
Yes I can find my way
A way back to you, yeah
If you keep the light on
So I can find my way (find my way)
Yes I can find my way (find my way)
A way back to you (back to you)

Light on (find my way)
Find my way (find my way)
Find my way (find my way)
(Back to you)
I'm gonna find it (light on) (find my way)
Hey I'm gonna find my way (find my way) (find my way)
Hey I'm gonna find my way (find my way) (find my way)
Hey back to you, back to you (back to you)
I'm gonna find it (light on) (find my way)
Hey I'm gonna find my way (find my way) (find my way)
Hey I'm gonna find my way (find my way) (find my way)
Hey back to you, back to you (back to you)

If you keep the light on (you'll find, you'll find, you'll find)
So I can find my way-ay-ay (find my way)
Yes I can find my way (find my way)
A way back to you, back to you (back to you)
Baby keep the light on (you'll find, you'll find, you'll find)
So I can find my way (find my way)
I can find my way (find my way)
A way back to you (back to you)

If you keep the light on (you'll find, you'll find, you'll find)
So I can find my way (find my way)
(Yes I can find my way) (Find my way)
Find my way back to you (back to you)
Baby keep the light on (you'll find, you'll find, you'll find)
So I can find my way (find my way)
Yes I can find my way (find my way)
A way back to you (back to you)
