Lyrics:


Hold up, hold up
What you sayinâ babe?
I heard that your loveâs only a mile away
Movinâ slow, why am I wide awake?
All of this pain Iâm tryinâ to take away
Donât bother me
Donât even bother calling
Drinking tonight
Iâm an alcoholic
Now Iâm trying something new tonight
Where the fuck is my lighter?
Iâm tired of all this shit
I want a lighter
Throw my drink in the fire
Just let me pass out
I just wanna escape
Turn the light s off
I wanna black out
We are not one and the same
So where the fuck is my lighter?
Iâmma take off while I can
While Iâm running with the flame
In the night time, Iâmma come alive
When Iâm seeing a crazy face
But none of âem look the same
Iâmma let go
Just wanna let go
I hear what youâre sayinâ
Got a liquor plan
Killinâ my brain is suicide
Veins burning up
It feels like Iâm gonna die
Iâll take two shots
Fuck it if you watching
Give me the bottle
Iâmma down it
Iâmma run off with the Swisher
Where the fuck is my lighter?
Iâm tired of all this shit
I want a lighter
Throw my drink in the fire
Just let me pass out
I just wanna escape
Turn the light s off
I wanna black out
We are not one and the same
So where the fuck is my lighter?
