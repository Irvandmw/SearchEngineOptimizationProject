Lyrics:


Are you really real
Do you feel the same thing that I do girl
When I touch you girl

Am I just a fool
to think that you could ever love me like I love you
I really do

I walk in the room
I speak to you and tell you that I love you girl
It's a lonely world

Please don't walk away
There's so much I meant to say, thought you'd like to know
I love you so

Are you really mine
Am I just someone for you to pass the time away
Just another day

Are you really real
Do you feel the same thing that I do girl
When I touch you girl
