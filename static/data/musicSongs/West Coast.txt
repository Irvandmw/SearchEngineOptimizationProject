Lyrics:


One more day, we'll spend together
Lay your eyes, look up upon me for the better
Oh, I know I'm worse for weather
But my love, I won't give up
Spend my days cursin' my soul
Wishing I could paint my scars and make me whole
Oh, I know I could be better
But my love, I won't give up

I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most

(Ooh) (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey
(Ooh) (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'll change my ways if you would stay
All your tears that you have cried would go away
Oh, just grant me one more day
Oh, my love, please don't give up
See the devil at my door
I see the future of the ones that I've ignored
I guess I was born to be at war
And my love, I won't give up
So my love, please don't give up

I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most

(Ooh) (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey
(Ooh) (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey

(Ooh) (Hey, hey, hey, hey) (I feel it)
Oh (Hey, hey, hey, hey) (I feel it)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be (I feel it)
I'll be your West Coast, honey (I feel it)
(Ooh) (Hey, hey, hey, hey) (I feel it)
Oh (Hey, hey, hey, hey) (I feel it)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be (I feel it)
I'll be your West Coast, honey (I feel it)
