Lyrics:


Touch the ceilinâ, act like how ya feelinâ 
Gonna rock it âtill the wheels comes off 
And keep it reelinâ
No mistakinâ, people shakinâ
And soon weâre gonna break it
âTill the last one stands because they canât take it

Touch the ceilinâ, act like how ya feelinâ 
Gonna rock it âtill the wheels comes off 
And keep it reelinâ
No mistakinâ, people shakinâ
And soon weâre gonna break it
âTill the last one stands because they canât take it

The rush is like nothing
It gets your blood pumpinâ
When you flip the switch, it comes on 
Itâll trail you, derail you
Hammer and nail you
To the point where you need to explode

Letâs put the pedal to the floor 
Here it comes, lets go
Wind it up and let it go
Weâre gonna watch it blow

If you want it, then we got it
We wonât let up, âtill we get enough 
Adrenaline overload
If you need it, then we bleed it
Make some room, here comes the boom! 
Adrenaline overload

And we wonât let it off
Thereâs nothinâ that can stop it
Until weâre in the coffin
If you want it, we got it
So letâs get it started
Adrenaline overload

Touch the ceilinâ, act like how ya feelinâ 
Gonna rock it âtill the wheels comes off 
And keep it reelinâ
No mistakinâ, people shakinâ
And soon weâre gonna break it
âTill the last one stands because they canât take it

Touch the ceilinâ, act like how ya feelinâ 
Gonna rock it âtill the wheels comes off 
And keep it reelinâ
No mistakinâ, people shakinâ
And soon weâre gonna break it
âTill the last one stands because they canât take it

It will stop at nothinâ
To make you feel somethinâ
âTill you feel like thatâs what you need 
But proceed with caution
âCause you can get lost
And not everything is what it seems

Letâs put the pedal to the floor 
Here it comes, lets go
Wind it up and let it go
Weâre gonna watch it blow

If you want it, then we got it
We wonât let up, âtill we get enough 
Adrenaline overload
If you need it, then we bleed it
Make some room, here comes the boom! 
Adrenaline overload

And we wonât let it off
Thereâs nothinâ that can stop it
Until weâre in the coffin
If you want it, we got it
So letâs get it started
Adrenaline overload

If you want it, then we got it
We wonât let up, âtill we get enough 
Adrenaline overload
If you need it, then we bleed it
Make some room, here comes the boom! 
Adrenaline overload

And we wonât let it off
Thereâs nothinâ that can stop it
Until weâre in the coffin
If you want it, we got it
So letâs get it started
Adrenaline overload
