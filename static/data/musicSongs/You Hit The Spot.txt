Lyrics:


You are my destination
I have to call
'cause you have so much on the ball
Ah you hit the spot
Like the first embrace with a modest tide
Well you hit the spot
Like pipe and slippers by the fireside
Matter of factly don't know exactly what it is that you've got
But you hit the spot
You hit the spot
Like a balmy breeze on a night in May
You hit the spot
Like a cool mint julep on a sunny day
You hit the spot
In my estimation ....
