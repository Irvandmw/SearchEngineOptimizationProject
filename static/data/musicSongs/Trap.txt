Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, heya
(Fallen)

Only love a real nigga ever knew I trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was the trap, that's fact, that's fact
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was

Trap, she do licks, she the one I forget
She do coke, she do blow
She do dope, make a list
Miss the life, don't forget
Sober nights, make it lit
She the one, you the one, I'm the one, what a trip
I ain't never tellin' lies, cross my heart and hope to die
If this real is real forever, maybe never testify
Put the pedal to floor, look the devil in the eye
If you tell me that you love me, promise not to change your mind

We lost sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned on, will you turn on alarm
Wish you furs for the winter, wish you champagne on ice
Middle fingers to the police

Only love a real nigga ever knew I trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was the trap, that's fact, that's fact
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was

Trap, only thing we ever had to do was trap
I was breaking down bales and now switched it with rap
Shawty was the man, like damn nigga, what happend?
I'm keep chasing the money, as far as I ever see
Had to kick my double-cup, feel like it was killin' me
I was sittin' in the spot, ain't never missed a beat
If I'm feelin' in my heart, I'ma put it on a beat, like
Run down around here
Make sure you hold your whole clip filled
Know it was hard livin, tryin' survive this bullshit
I'm a part of my niggas, we all gon' get rich
Still remember sellin' 2-for-5
Now I have a million dollar ride
Still be havin' thoughts about the guy

Only love a real nigga ever knew was
We lost sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned on, will you turn on alarm
Wish you furs for the winter, wish you champagne on ice
Middle fingers to the police

Only love a real nigga ever knew I trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was the trap, that's fact, that's fact
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was
