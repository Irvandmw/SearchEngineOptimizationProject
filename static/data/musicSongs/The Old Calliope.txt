Lyrics:


My grandpa was a minstrel man
A minstrel man was he
And to tell the truth I guess I've got some minstrel blood in me

You can have all the harps in heaven
Blow all the horns here on the ground
But I find I still get my greatest thrill
Every time I hear this sound

I love to hear that old calliope
I love the melody of an old calliope
And when you hear the thrilling harmony
Gather round the minstrel's show's in town

It sounds so good
That old calliope
What is more heavenly
Than an old calliope
Here comes the band
Oh what a sight to see
Gather round the minstrel's show's in town

Banjos strumming
Folks are humming
Minstrel's coming
What a show what a show
[Both] It's the finest show I know

It's coming near [JL] Coming near coming near
That old calliope [JL] What a sight to see
Oh what a melody [JL] What a melody
Oh the old calliope [JL] Old calliope
[Both] So loud and clear
That thrilling harmony
Gather round the minstrel's show's in town

There's the interlocutor
And Mr. Bones so full of life
Who's that lady you were with last night
[JL] That was no lady that was my wife
[DM] Ha ha [JL] Ha Ha [DM] Ho ho [JL] Ho ho
[Both] What a show what a show what a show

Says the interlocutor
To Mr. Bones so full of pride
Why does a chicken cross the road
[JL] Why to get to the other side

I love to hear that old calliope
I love the melody of an old calliope
[JL] And when you hear that thrilling harmony
[Both] Gather round the minstrel's show's in town
