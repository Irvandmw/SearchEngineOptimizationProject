Expectations (expectations)
Can make you believe (can make you believe)
That what you desire (what you desire)
Is what you need
And I'm thinking
What if we just stop
Livin' in the moment?
And I'm thinking
And maybe we both will be
Way less disappointed

From all these e-e-e-e-e-expectations
E-e-e-e-e-expectations
So many e-e-e-e-e-expectations
E-e-e-e-e-expectations
Yeah

Expectations (expectations)
Babe, I know you don't mean (said I know you don't mean)
To make small situations (make small situations)
Bigger than they should be
Than they should be
And I'm thinking
What if we just stop
Living in the present?
And I'm thinking
And maybe we both will be
Way less disconnected

From all these e-e-e-e-e-expectations
E-e-e-e-e-expectations
So many e-e-e-e-e-expectations
E-e-e-e-e-expectations

How can I read your mind if I donât want to
How can I read your mind if I donât want to
How can I read your mind if I donât want to
How can I read your mind if I donât want to
So many e-e-e-e-e-expectations
