Lyrics:


Everything, everything, everything...

I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up
That girl comes without a warning
So addicting, I canât get enough
She gets dressed for work, grabs her keys then she leaves
Yeah that goodbye kiss kills me

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
Sheâs everything I wanna need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I canât help but think
There goes my everything

Everything, everything, everything...

Everytime weâre in a party
I still watch her from across the room
I ainât notice everybody
They canât even help but watch her too
Dressed up or dressed down
And she canât help but shine
I canât believe sheâs mine

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
Sheâs everything I wanna need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I canât help but think
There goes my everything

There goes my everything

Everything, everything, everything...

I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
Sheâs everything I wanna need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I canât help but think
There goes my everything

There goes my everything

Everything, everything, everything...
