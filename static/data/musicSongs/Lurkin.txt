[Chris Brown:]
He shake you from the east and he shake you from the west
He shake you from the north and then shake you from the south
Soundboy, dis a mashup the place
Oh, do dis
Yeah

Girl, I know all your secrets (Uh)
Put it down, you no regret
Girl, that pussy man ah lick it (Uh)
Mi not gon' listen to the "He said-she said"
Girl, I'm gon' drink from your water (Uh)
Mi ah go down in the deep end, baby
Mi ah gon' spend every dollar
Just bring your body here, bring your body here

Put it in my face, I'll be alright
Make your legs shake, guess I'm doing alright
Just give me a kiss, it's a late night
You can see it in my eyes

Baby, I've been lurkin', that's how she do
Put her down, down, down, down in my bed
Call it murder (Yeah)
Hold on, hold on
Girl, your body got me workin'
Yeah, that's how she do
Put her down, down, down, down in my bed (Ow!)
Oh, she gonna learn her lesson
Let her run, run, run 'round in my head

[Tory Lanez:]
It's going down, down, down, down in my bed
If I go down, down, down, I get you wet
You know you don't want to make me your bet
You know I'm gone and I'm making you sweat
I'm coming live from the V-I-P
She know what we do is B-I-G
Baby face gyal need to see ID
Before I kill that shit, D-I-E
She like deez and a good sex
She like straight out the hood sex
She gwan do it, gwan do it now
I get it waetter, then we could drown

[Chris Brown:]
Put it in my face, I'll be alright
Make your legs shake, guess I'm doing alright
Just give me a kiss, it's a late night
You can see it in my eyes

Baby, I've been lurking, that's how she do
Put her down, down, down, down in my bed
Call it murder (Yeah)
Hold on, hold on
Girl, your body got me working
Yeah, that's how she do
Put her down, down, down, down in my bed (Ow!)
Oh, she gonna learn her lesson
Let her run, run, run 'round in my head
