Lyrics:


Oh my god, were you looking at her butt?

You're such a good boy and let's keep it the way
You're going out with your guys tonight
And you can flirt, boy, shut the window displays
They'll get you drunk, misbehave alright? Alright!
Yeah, I let you walk the line 'cause you come home every time
And I won't never give you reasons not to
You're such a good boy and let's keep it the way
Yeah, let's keep it the way
Yeah, let's keep it the way

You can look, but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch (ah-ah)
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (her butt)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (ah-ah)
Dont touch! Don't even think about it!

I'll be your bad girl, when you came later tonight
I can treat you and feed your appetite
You wouldn't dare leave me home alone too long
And get me thinking something's really wrong
Yeah, I'll let it you draw my line, you'll be the captain every time
I'll let you think you're in control of this
You're such a good a boy and let's keep it the way
Yeah, let's keep it the way
Yeah, let's keep it the way

You can look, but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch (ah-ah ah oh)
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (her butt)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (ah-ah ah oh)
Don't touch! Don't even think about it!

I'm only saying baby
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (what?)

I saw you looking at her butt, it's a J E L L O
You say you get me another drink, but I saw you say hello
You think I'm blind, you think I'm deaf, and you think that I'm dumb
I ain't your Helen Keller, honey!
I'm your number one
Don't you forget it

You can look, but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (don't you forget it), you can look but you can't touch (punk)
(Don't you forget it)
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (don't you forget it)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (punk)
