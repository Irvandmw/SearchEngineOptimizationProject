Lyrics:


I don't need love, that shit is so, so petty
Don't you go tweet about it, we could speak about it
If you really, really with me

I'ma be in the gas stations, in the CVSs, gettin' givies
Yeah, and if you really my nigga
Word to mother, we gon' split it 50/50
Yeah, they call me a SoundCloud boy
They stealin' my sound now, boy
I feel like I'm really the King of my City
I got the crown now, boy
Two .38's on the side of me, lookin' like a cowboy, yeah
Niggas be actin' like bitches, I might as well just call you Tomboys
Don't play with me, .38 on me and I'm feelin' so, so special
Niggas is lucky, I'm busy gettin' money 'cause I really couldn't love you
Pull up in my hoodie on the scene, so, so scary
I prolly got more Mike Amiri jeans than Mike Amiri
Yeah, beasties are lurkin' in the bushes
Now when I open my eyes
I look in the skies, hopin' I make it to Heaven
You can have family ties or risk it to die, you can still be a dub
If you tellin' it, and even if it was my cousin
Nigga's a dub, fuck it, just knock off his melon

I swear I don't need love, that shit is so, so petty
Don't you go tweet about it, we could speak about it
If you really, really with me
Pull up in my hoodie on the scene, so, so scary
I prolly got more Mike Amiri jeans than Mike Amiri

Heard they wanna catch me lackin', oh, please
Yeah, they don't know I'm really OD
Niggas rattin', eatin' on cheese
Just free the real until they all free
Hoodie on, rockin' long sleeves, uh, uh
Richard Mille made my wrist bleed, hmm, hmm
Lamborghini car keys, vroom, vroom
I don't know why they actin' like they G'd up, hmm, hmm
Wipin' nigga nose like he sneezin', hmm
Go to Eliantte for Aquafina, huh, uh
Chain lookin' like a hockey puck, huh, like a freezer, huh
You told me never say never
And you told me you would never get me set up
But love is a set up already
Should have said "I love you" to a Bentley
I know niggas that ain't even graduate can't leave the country
They felons already
But fuck it, at least they know better
Any nigga could tell 'em, no tellin'
I done seen niggas tell on they brother
Them niggas was there for you when you were strugglin'
I done seen niggas love on they bitch
And go kiss her and hug her right after she suckin' dick
And you gotta watch out for niggas that's watchin' your money
Watch who you get money with
And don't you compete with your own gang
No, don't you go be on no funny shit
'Cause niggas will tell on they whole gang
'Cause they was jealous, so jealous, yeah
I was addicted to Balmain, I did every Amiri denim
I'm not a regular person, I threw away my Margielas
Got a closet with nothing but fly shit
Trendsetter from my hat to my sweater, yeah, yeah

I swear I don't need love, that shit is so, so petty
Don't you go tweet about it we could speak about it
If you really, really with me
Pull up in my hoodie on the scene, so, so scary
I prolly got more Mike Amiri jeans than Mike Amiri

Hoodie on, rockin' long sleeves, uh, uh
Richard Mille made my wrist bleed, uh, uh
Lamborghini car keys, vroom vroom
