Lyrics:
Lyrics:


They say men are such fools
And a woman must forgive them
I know I was wrong
Forgive me
Won't you give me one more chance

Take a broken heart
Make a broken heart smile again
I'm in love with you
Say you love me too
And take my arms
Take my lips
Take my tears away and love me
Come back to my arms
Believe me, if you leave me I will die

Take a broken heart
Make a broken heart smile again
I'm in love with you
Say you love me too, sweetheart
Come back to my arms
Believe me, if you leave me I will die

Take a broken heart
Make a broken heart smile again
I'm in love with you
Say you love me too, sweetheart
