Lyrics:


[Shane:]
As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

[Shane (All):]
What becomes of the broken hearted
Who have love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

[Mark (All):]
Fruits of love
Grow all around (all around)
But for me they come a-tumbling down (a-tumbling down)
Every day heart aches grow a little stronger
(Just a little stonger)
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows searching for light (searching for light)
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
(No comfort in sight)
Hopin' and prayin' for someone to care (someone to care)
Always movin' and going nowhere

[All:]
What becomes of the broken hearted
Who have love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please

[Shane:]
I'm searching though I don't succeed
(I don't succeed)
Someone's love there's a growing need
(Such a growing need)
All is lost there's no place for beginning
(No beginning)
All that's left is an unhappy ending
Unhappy ending

[Shane (All):]
Now what becomes of the broken hearted
Who have love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'l be looking every day
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who have love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Baby
Oh yeah
What becomes of the broken hearted
Who have love that's now departed
What becomes of the broken hearted
Who have love that's now departed
What becomes of the broken hearted
