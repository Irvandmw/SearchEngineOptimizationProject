Lyrics:


Smiling all along but I was fakin'
Each and every second I was breakin'
I said that I was numb but I was achin' in my bones
The panic in my heart is hard to breathe through
This the kinda thing they never teach you
I never thought I'd ever have to leave you on your own

Baby, take care of your heart
Every day that I'm not with you
If you're ever scared of the dark
Remember, I told you
Darling, I will never be far
Wherever you go, what you do
Baby, I was there from the start
Remember, I told you

Honestly it hurts too much to say this
So I will write it down and you can save it
And read it when I'm not around to say it for myself, yeah
Savor every moment 'cause they go fast
The fireworks are bright because they don't last
But promise me you'll walk along your own path, no one else's

Baby, take care of your heart
Every day that I'm not with you
If you're ever scared of the dark
Remember, I told you
Darling, I will never be far
Wherever you go, what you do
Baby, I was there from the start
Remember, I told you

When you bump your head
And then you lose your thread
Darlin', I'll be there
Remember, I told you
From when it's all just plain
To your wedding day
Even when the pictures fade
Remember, I told you

So, baby, take care of your heart
Every day that I'm not with you
If you're ever scared of the dark
Remember, I told you
Darling, I will never be far
Wherever you go what you do
Baby, I was there from the start
Remember, I told you

So, baby, take care of your heart
Every day that I'm not with you
If you're ever scared of the dark
Remember, I told you
Darling, I will never be far
Wherever you go what you do
Baby, I was there from the start
Remember, I told you
