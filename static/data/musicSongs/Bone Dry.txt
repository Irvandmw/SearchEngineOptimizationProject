Lyrics:


Bone, bone, bone, bone, bone

Bone dry, you know I'm bone dry
I won't try no more for the way you tore my heart
Bone dry, you know I'm bone dry
I wouldn't shed another tear, my dear, cause I'm bone dry

Coming home late, or not coming home at all
Ain't nothing but lies when you take the time to call
You're making it easy for me to say goodbye
The last you dry from calling bye byes

Bone dry, you know I'm bone dry
I won't try no more for the way you tore my heart
Bone dry, you know I'm bone dry
I wouldn't shed another tear, dear, cause I'm bone dry

Nasty things you did, keep my tears and you throw them
And now the feeling's going to kill me from going
You did everything you could to break my heart in too
I cried the blues long enough for you

Bone dry, you know I'm bone dry
I won't try no more for the way you tore my heart
Bone dry, you know I'm bone dry
I wouldn't shed another tear, my dear, cause I'm bone dry

I used to have a burning hot desire
All the tears I cried, done put out the fire
And your new love will see right through you
I guarantee you'll be crying too

Bone dry, you know I'm bone dry
I won't try no more for the way you tore my heart
Bone dry, you know I'm bone dry
I wouldn't shed another tear, my dear, cause I'm bone dry

Bone, bone, bone, bone, bone
