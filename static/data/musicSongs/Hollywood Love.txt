Lyrics:


Do you wanna hear a story about a girl?
This ain't no fairytale
21 and she already despises the world
Never try you'll never fail
And her mom didn't care
And her dad wasn't there
Unaware that his daughter might slip away
Do you wanna hear a story about a girl?

She didn't want to know, Oh
But she couldn't say no, Oh
Hollywood love
Hollywood love
Hollywood love you
If you gave her enough

Do you wanna hear what happened to our little girl?
The queen she'll never be
All alone never nobody cares in the world
Not a loss or tragedy
Every man that she meets
Pulls her hands to the sheets
To the streets she just keeps running back again
You don't wanna know what happened to our little girl

She didn't want to know, Oh
But she couldn't say no, Oh
Hollywood love
Hollywood love
Hollywood love you
If you gave her enough

She don't love you
She's above you
She can't cry anymore
No, she can't cry anymore

She didn't want to know, Oh
But she couldn't say no, Oh
Hollywood love
Hollywood love
Hollywood love you
If you gave her enough
Hollywood love
Hollywood love
Hollywood love you
If you gave her enough
