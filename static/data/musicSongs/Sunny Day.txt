Lyrics:


Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....(welcome to my sunny day)...

Block don't stop, always stay hot
No matter how the season scorch
I still remember when they took me away
Kept it on lock, then I got popped
Realized I had to stop
Then I took time to explore a better way

Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

I was born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
Saw my first 9 millimeter in the ghetto
I got my first kiss in the ghetto
Playin' hide go seek with the girls in the ghetto
I wrote my first hit in the ghetto
Yo Mona Lisa, can I get a date on Friday-ay-ay
It's hard for me to let go, life in the ghetto
The night they blast my cousin, whoa
I had to find a way out the ghetto
Picked up the guitar, started singin' in the ghetto
Haters used to hate in the ghetto
Said I would have never made it out the ghetto
I guess that's why my cousin sold the yayo
Even though Annie said the sun come out tomorrow
But the ghetto stay dark
I never thought I'd ever see the Billboard charts

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

Been a long day...
On my way to my holy place to pray...
Give thanks for every blessing given to me...
I know there's more to see...more to me...no more living in misery...
Cause this is how I visioned life to beee.....

Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go...
I just know, there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
