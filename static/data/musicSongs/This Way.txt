Lyrics:


[Khalid:]
You say I'm trippin', bullshit
You're the one to make me do shit
You're the one to make me feel it
The feeling of stupid
I was in your corner
When you were putting me through shit
Now you wanna leave
No, you leaving me was foolish

You left me this scar on my heart
And I left you a brand new car
How nice of you, the price of true love
True love is absolute

So what more can I say?
You make me this way
What more can I say?
You make me this way

[H.E.R.:]
Yeah, all of these excuses
Say I'm the one that made you ruthless
But you're the reason I'm crazy
And with you I feel useless
I let you have it
You took me for granted
Always wanna play the victim
When they don't know the truth is...

[Khalid & H.E.R.:]
You left me this scar on my heart
[H.E.R.:]
When I'd never take it that far (oh)
Why would you say that it was true love
If true love is absolute, what more can I say?

[Khalid & H.E.R. (H.E.R.)]
What more can I say?
You make me this way
(You make me this way)
What more can I say?
(What can I say?)
You make me this way

[H.E.R.:]
I tried to stay the night
You won't let me inside
Oh, you push me away
You'll never change
Just another fight
Between you and your pride
Oh, what more can I say?
What more can I?

[Khalid (H.E.R.):]
What more can I say? (Say)
You make me this way
(You make me this way)
What more can I say?
(What more?)
You make me this way (way)
(What, can I?)
