Lyrics:


I can't believe this moment's come
It's so incredible that we're alone
There's so much to be said and done
It's impossible not to be overcome

Will you forgive me if I feel this way
'Cause we've just met, tell me that's OK
So take this feeling, make it grow
Never let it, never let it go

(Don't let go of the things you believe in)
You give me something that I can believe in
(No, don't let go of this moment in time)
Go of this moment in time
(Don't let go of things that you're feeling)
I can't explain the things that I'm feeling
(No, don't let go)
No, I won't let go

Now would you mind if I bared my soul
(I bared my soul to you)
If I came right out and said you're beautiful
'Cause there's something here I can't explain
I feel I'm diving into driving rain

You get my senses running wild
I can't resist your sweet, sweet smile
So take this feeling make it grow
Never let it, never let it go

(Don't let go of the things you believe in)
You give me something that I can believe in
(No, don't let go of this moment in time)
Go of this moment in time
(Don't let go of things that you're feeling)
I can't explain the things that I'm feeling
(No, don't let go)
No, I won't let go

I've been waiting all my life
(All my life)
To make this moment feel so right
(Feel so right)
The feel of you just fills the night
So c'mon - let's just hold on tight

(Don't let go of the things you believe in)
You give me something that I can believe in
(No, don't let go of this moment in time)
Go of this moment in time
(Don't let go of things that you're feeling)
I can't explain the things that I'm feeling
(No, don't let go)
No, I won't let go

(Don't let go)
No, I won't let go
(No, don't let go)
No, I won't let go
