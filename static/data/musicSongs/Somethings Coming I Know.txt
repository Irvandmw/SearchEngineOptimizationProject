Lyrics:


You worn it out and man, it just don't fit you no more.
And don't you try to deceive me
You know that you can believe me
If you're man enough you're gonna hear the bitter truth
So, won't you come on?

Something's coming, I know
Something's coming, it shows
Something's coming, I know

You disappointing everyone just messin' around now
It's clear enough, you know, we're all running clean out of time
Don't want ever grieve you
Have bunch of us bereave you
And if you're man enough you're gonna hear the bitter truth
So, won't you come on?

Something's coming, I know
Something's coming, it shows
Something's coming, I know, believe me now
Something's rounding the bend
Something always comes in the end
Something's coming, I know,

And when your children ask about your life
And all the memories you might make tonight
You forsake tonight
Nothing last forever
