(Rippa on the beat, bitch)
Trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
Trap, trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
Trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin' (Let me hear it)
Uh, ooh

Trap, trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
When you hit my phone, leave them drugs in your stomach
And if mine jump behind, then, baby, I'm runnin'
Baby, I'm bomin', tell me if you comin'
Call me if you really wanna get high
You ain't gettin' nowhere with them other guys
They don't ever hold you down, they don't get you fly
Red bottoms, she feel like she in the sky
Got the trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
Trap, trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
Trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
(Oh baby, I don't wanna hear nothin')

'Cause I really got the dopest of the dopest
It make them hoes focus, she ridin' 'round hopeless, like
Where the dopeman? I really need the dopeman
Please don't take this pill without water, you might choke, ma'am
When I say I'm outside, she say the door open
Walk up in the crib, in the bed, I get to pokin'
She get to screamin', her kids gonna wake up
I think it's the drugs she be takin' 'cause the

Trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
Trap, trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin' (Hear nothin')

When you hit my phone, leave them drugs in your stomach
And if mine jump behind, then, baby, I'm runnin'
Baby, I'm bomin', tell me if you comin'
Call me if you really wanna get high
You ain't gettin' nowhere with them other guys (No)
They don't ever hold you down, they don't get you fly
Red bottoms, she feel like she in the sky
Got the trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
Trap, trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
Trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'

I don't wanna hear a damn thing 'bout no money (No)
All a nigga tryna say is why you run from me? (Why you runnin'?)
Hunt for me
Every time the night come, grip the 40 and Bible
She text me and say that pussy on arrival
Told the promoters put that pussy on the rider
Fuck around and catch your girl, I'm a sniper
Haha, her lil' nose, I'ma wipe her (Haha)
Yeah, I caught her like a sniper (Yeah, I caught her)
Yeah, red, red bottoms on the right one (Red bottoms on the right one)

Call me if you really wanna get high
You ain't gettin' nowhere with them other guys (No)
They don't ever hold you down, they don't get you fly
Red bottoms, she feel like she in the sky
Got the trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
Trap, trap back jumpin', I don't wanna hear nothin'
