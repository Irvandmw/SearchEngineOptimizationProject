Lyrics:


If you're in the mood for something different and new
There's a pants suit we have on sale and it's just made for you
-Oh no, what will the neighbors say?
Don't worry lady, they're gonna love it

There's a miniskirt that hardly covers your thighs
If you just pull your tummy in I'm sure it's just your size
- Oh no, what will my husband say?
Don't worry lady, he's gonna love it

I know just what to do
And before I'm through
You'll be dressed right in fashion
- Do me a favor, don't do me favors please
I won't expose any part of you but your knees
It isn't very hard to become a Mod
All you need is passion
- I've got passion to get rid of you
We have furs for fun in orange, purple and red
There's a wig on a mannikin that should be on your head
- Oh no, not even if it's free
Don't worry lady
- Oh please, people will laugh at me
Don't worry lady, they're gonna love it
They're gonna love it
