Lyrics:


Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land
Tell old Pharaoh to let my people go

When Israel was in Egypt land
Let my people go
Oppressed so hard they could not stand
Let my people go

So the lord said, "Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land
Tell old Pharaoh to let my people go."

So Moses went to Egypt land
Let my people go
He made old Pharaoh understand
Let my people go

Yes, the Lord said, "Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land.
Tell old Pharaoh to let my people go."

Thus spoke the Lord," bold Moses said
Let my people go
"If not, I'll smite your firstborns dead."
Let my people go

God, the Lord said, "Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land
Tell old Pharaoh to let my people go."

Way down in Egypt land
Tell old Pharaoh to let my people go
