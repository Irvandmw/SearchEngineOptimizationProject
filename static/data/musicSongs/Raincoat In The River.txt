Lyrics:


I'm gonna throw my raincoat in the river
Gonna toss my umbrella in the sea
The sun's gonna sine like never before
Ain't gonna rain, gonna rain no more
Now my baby's comin' back to me

Oh can't you see my raincoat in the river
Floatin' down, forever out of sight
For every drop of rain that fell on my face
I know we'll share another sweet embrace
Now she'll be back in my arms tonight

Now the rain's been drippin', drip drop a drippin'
every day you've been away
Now the rain is stoppin' no more drip drip droppin'
You're back to stay, that's why I say

I'm gonna throw my raincoat in the river
Gonna toss my umbrella in the sea
The sun's gonna sine like never before
Ain't gonna rain, gonna rain no more
Now my baby's comin' back to me

Now the rain's been drippin', drip drop a drippin'
every day you've been away
Now the rain is stoppin' no more drip drip droppin'
You're back to stay, that's why I say

I'm gonna throw my raincoat in the river
Gonna toss my umbrella in the sea
The sun's gonna sine like never before
Ain't gonna rain, gonna rain no more
Now my baby's comin' back to me woh, oh yeah
Now my baby's comin' back to me
