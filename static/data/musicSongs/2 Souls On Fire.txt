Lyrics:


[Bebe Rexha:]
Desire, two souls on fire
Desire, two souls on fire

[Quavo:]
You got me out here looking foolish
Look like a dog, I'm drooling
[Bebe Rexha:]
Close your mouth boy and just prove it
And you know just the way to do it
[Quavo (Bebe Rexha):]
You gon' make me bring the bad girl, believe me (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
You gon' make me pop some tags, fashion season (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Bebe Rexha:]
You gon' make me do those moves to stop your breathing (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you losing faith, I'll make you believe it

[Quavo (Bebe Rexha):]
Got me feeling some type of way (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got a chain on my heart and it's spinning in diamonds

[Bebe Rexha (Quavo):]
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
(Feel some type of way)
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire

[Quavo:]
We can go out to the islands on privates
We can drive the latest cars, no mileage
[Bebe Rexha:]
We can do whatever you like, just be quiet
If you don't break my heart, I'll let you inside it

[Quavo (Bebe Rexha):]
Got me feeling some type of way (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got a chain on my heart and it's spinning in diamonds
(And that chain around your heart got me blinded)

[Bebe Rexha (Quavo):]
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
(Feel some type of way)
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire

[Quavo (Bebe Rexha):]
Do I make you feel some type of way? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Both:]
Got a chain around my heart and it's spinning in diamonds
[Bebe Rexha:]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And that chain around your heart got me blinded

[Bebe Rexha (Quavo):]
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
(Feel some type of way)
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
(Do I make you feel some type of way?)
