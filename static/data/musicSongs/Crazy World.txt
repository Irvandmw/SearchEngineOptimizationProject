Lyrics:


My little girl
I read your fantasy
You wanna be able to fly you wanna cross the sea

My little girl
I know just how you feel
You wanna be making a difference head over heels

[Chorus:]
This is a crazy world
we are living in
Youâre such a clever girl
and you know how to win
anything you need is just imagination

Donât get me wrong
I wish you everything
and every fame and fortune tomorrow could bring
You will become more than a rich mans wife
Cause you are demanding some sense to the meaning of life

[Chorus:]
This is a crazy world
we are living in
Youâre such a clever girl
and you know how to win
anything you need is just imagination

[Release:]
Underneath the makeup thereâs a fragile face
crying for someone to embrace
right beyond the big screen thereâs a burning soul
forever longing to be held
