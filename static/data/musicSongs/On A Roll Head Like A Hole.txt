Lyrics:


Oh, honey, I'll do anything for you
Oh, honey, just tell me what you want me to
Oh, honey, kiss me up against the wall
Oh, honey, don't think anything, just have it all

Yeah, I can't take it, so don't you fake it
I know your love's my destiny
Yeah I can't take take it, please demonstrate it
'Cause I'm going down in history

Hey, yeah, whoa, ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals
Hey, yeah, whoa, ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals

I'm stoked on ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve
So full of ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve

Oh, honey, let's get in through the door
Oh, honey, not concerned who sees us ripping up the floor
Oh, honey, we'll go dancing wherever you choose
Oh, honey, you know we just can't lose

Yeah, I can't take it, so don't you fake it
I know your love's my destiny
Yeah, I can't take take it, please demonstrate it
'Cause I'm going down in history

Hey, yeah, whoa, ho, I'm on a roll
Riding so high, achieving my goals
Hey, yeah, whoa, ho, I'm on a roll
Riding so high, achieving my goals

I'm stoked on ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve
So full of ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve
