Lyrics:


Look at me
You think that I'm tryin' to fight ya
But I'll always be on your side, yeah
Oh oh oh
You know me
Why you always on defense then?
Making me feel like you're fenced in
Oh oh oh

How many times do I have to convince you
That I'll always be on your team?
You're runnin' your mouth and you're talking about me
But things aren't always what they seem

So whenever you're losin'
I'll celebrate ya
Appreciate ya
I'll get you up on your feet
Whenever you're winning
I'll give you strength, boy
And I'll cheer your name, girl
'Cause I'll always be on your, I'll always be on your team
Yeah, I'll always be on your team

Look at me
Babe, you know that I'm no angel
I know I'm a lot to handle
Oh oh oh, yeah
But you know me
When I love you, I love you harder
With all of my, all of my heart, yeah
Oh oh oh

So whenever you're losing (losing)
I'll celebrate ya (I'll celebrate)
Appreciate ya (appreciate ya)
I'll get you up on your feet
Whenever you're winning (winning)
I'll give you strength, girl
And I'll cheer your name, boy
'Cause I'll always be on your, I'll always be on your team
Your team (oh yeah)
Your team (oh yeah)
Yeah, I'll always be on your team (oh yeah)
Your team (oh yeah)

How many times do I have to convince you
That I'll always be on your team?

So whenever you're losing (losing)
I'll celebrate ya
Appreciate ya (appreciate ya)
I'll get you up on your feet
Whenever you're winning
I'll give you strength, boy
And I'll cheer your name, girl
'Cause I'll always be on your, I'll always be on your team (oh yeah)
Yeah, I'll always be on your team (oh yeah)
And I'll always be on your, I'll always be on your team (oh yeah)
Yeah, I'll always be on your team
I'll always be
'Cause I'll always be on your, oh, I'll always be on your team
Yeah, I'll always be on your team
