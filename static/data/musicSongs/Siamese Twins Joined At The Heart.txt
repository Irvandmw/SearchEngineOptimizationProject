Lyrics:


I find you in my arms, this is how it begins
And we are so close, like Siamese twins
Though you're separate from me, and we're often apart
Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart

Joined at the heart
Joined at the heart
Joined at the heart

You don't look like me it's true and I don't look like you
As we lead separate lives our secret still survives
Only we know our special affection
Only we know our secret connection

Now you're back in my arms, at the end of the day
And like Siamese twins, with each other we'll stay
Though you're separate from me, and we're often apart
Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart

Joined at the heart
Joined at the heart

Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart
