Lyrics:


Well I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feelin' that somethin' ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wonderin' why I get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

Well I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm wonderin' what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep the smile from my face
And I'm wanderin' all around the place
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

Well you started out with nothin'
And you found out that you're somethin' man
And you're friends they all come callin'
Slap you on the back and say...

I'm tryin' to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
If I could I'd go to sleep on the floor
But I don't think I can take anymore
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

Well I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feelin' that somethin' ain't right
If I could I'd go to sleep on the floor
But I don't think I could take anymore
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
