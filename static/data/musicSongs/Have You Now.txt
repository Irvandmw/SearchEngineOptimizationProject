Lyrics:


I'm not okay without you
I die each day without you
My body aches without you around, around, around

I must've been a wild one, honey I know
With every other guy I should've said no
I really could've used your loving before

But I'm glad I have you now (have you now)
I'm happy that you're my own (that you're mine)
Don't let me down
Stay with me for life (life)
I'm glad I have you now (have you now)
I've waited all this time (all this time)
So don't let me down
Stay with me for life (life)
I'm glad I have you now

I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm)
I have you now
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm)

I lose all faith without you
Not sure I'm safe without you
I make mistakes without you around, around, around, aye

I must've been a wild one, honey I know
With every other guy I should've said no
I really could've used your loving before (your loving before)

But I'm glad I have you now (have you now)
I'm happy that you're my own (all mine babe)
Don't let me down
Stay with me for life (stay with me for life)
I'm glad I have you now (have you now)
I've waited all this time (all this time)
So don't let me down (don't let me down)
Stay with me for life (life)
I'm glad I have you now

I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm) (hey)
I have you (mmm)
I have you now
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm) (I have you)
I have you (mmm) (I have you)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm) (I have you)
I have you (mmm) (I have you)
I have you (mmm)

I must've been a wild one, honey I know
With every other guy I should've said no
I really could've used your loving before, before, say
I must've been a wild one, honey I know
With every other guy I should've said no (I should've said no)
I really could've used your loving before, before (mmm, mmm)

I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm)
I have you now
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm) (yeah, I said I have you baby)
I have you (mmm) (oh)

I have you (mmm) (I must've been a wild one honey)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm) (With every other guy I should've said no)
I have you (mmm) (I really could've used your loving before)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm) (Before, oh)
I have you (mmm) (I must've been a wild one honey)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm) (With every other guy I should've said no)
I have you (mmm) (I really could've used your loving before)
I have you (mmm)
I have you (mmm)
But I'm glad I have you now
