Lyrics:


[Brian:]
I been walking around
Inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost
Of yesterday
Feels like I'm barely breathing

[Chorus:]
I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin<
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

[Howie:]
I've been losin days
The shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun

[Nick:]
But I-I'm goin crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone

[Repeat Chorus]

[AJ:]
Oh no
I thought you were the only one girl
But now I think I was wrong
Cause life goes on
Na na na na na...

[Brian:]
I've been walking around inside a haze

[Nick:]
Oh I...

[Repeat Chorus]

[Nick:]
In a downpour feel the rain
Feel the rain

[AJ:]
I wanna feel the rain
