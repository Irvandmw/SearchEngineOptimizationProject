Lyrics:


I know a secret place to go...
nothing to fool me.. my heart's still close
rising up to the air, just without any care
yeah I'm watching the birds
they don't know how it hurts
to be loving you...
and to feel this kind of blue

I'm talking to myself try to break the silence
I'm going crazy and I promised that I'll wait for you
staring through the candle light
I no longer see your eyes
and I promise that I'll wait for you

I thought that I saw you in my room
but that was the curtain 
playing with the moon
when my hand on the ground
I've been fooling around
yeah I'm watching the birds
they don't know how it hurts
to be loving you...
and to feel this kind of blue

I'm talking to myself try to break the silence
I'm going crazy and I promised that I will wait for you
staring through the candle light
I no longer see your eyes
and I promise that I'll wait for you

The picture of you is frozen in blue...

I'm talking to myself try to break the silence
I'm going crazy and I promise that I will wait for you
staring through the candle light
I no longer see your eyes
That I'll wait for you
That I'll wait for you
