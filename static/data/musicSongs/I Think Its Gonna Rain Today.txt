Lyrics:


Broken windows, empty hallways
Pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey
Human kindness, ah, it's overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrow's dressed in the latest style
With frozen smiles to chase love away
Human kindness, ah, it's overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet, think I'll kick it down the street
That's a way to treat a friend

Right before me, the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness, ah, it's overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet, think I'll kick it down the street
That's a way to treat a friend

Right before me, the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness, ah, it's overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

I think it's going to rain today
I think it's going to rain today
Mmmm....
