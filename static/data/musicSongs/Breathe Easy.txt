Lyrics:


Cruel to the eye
I see the way he makes you smile
Cruel to the eye
Watching him hold what used to be mine

Why did I lie?
What did I walk away to find
Oh, why, oh, why?

I can't breathe easy
Can't sleep at night
'Til you're by my side
No, I can't breathe easy
I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me
There's no air

Curse me inside
For every word that caused you to cry
Curse me inside
I won't forget, no, I won't, baby, I
Don't know why (don't know why)
I left the one I was looking to find
Oh, why, oh, why, why?

I can't breathe easy
Can't sleep at night
'Til you're by my side
No, I can't breathe easy
I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me
There's no air

Out of my mind
Nothing makes sense anymore
I want you back in my life
That's all I'm breathing for

Can't sleep at night
'Til you're by my side
I can't breathe easy
I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me
There's no air
There's no air
