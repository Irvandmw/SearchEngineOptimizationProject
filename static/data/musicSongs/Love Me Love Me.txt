Lyrics:


Love me, love me
Love me with all your heart
Kiss me dear while I hold you tight
Make this evening a magic night
Love me, love me

Promise me we'll never part
You can make all my dreams come true
If you'll love me as I love you

Darling I love you, I love you
More than you ever could know
Daytimes I spent dreaming of you
Nightimes telling you so
Yours is the softness of spring to me
Your is the beauty of fall
Heaven is mine when you cling to me
You I adore overall

(Love me. love me)
(Love me with all your heart)
Kiss me dear while I hold you tight
I'll make this evening a magic night
(Love me, love me)
(Promise we'll never part)
You can make all my dreams come true
If you'll love me as I love you
If you'll love me as I love you
If you'll love me as I love you
