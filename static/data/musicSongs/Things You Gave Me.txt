Lyrics:


You gave me so many things to remember you by
Like a heart full of emptiness like tears in my eyes
When my heartaches all have gone
It will be because you gave me so much leavin' alone

I've got everything I'll need to remember you
I've got all the things you gave me
And you gave me quite a few
Got a heart full of emptiness, got tears in my eyes
I got wall to wall sadness, I can walk on while I cry

You gave me so many things to remember you by
Like a heart full of emptiness like tears in my eyes
When my heartaches all have gone
It will be because you gave me so much leavin' alone

But I wish you hadn't give me this solitude
It's a gift that keeps on givin' after you've gone
Gone, gone, gone, when my heartaches all have gone
It will be because you gave me so much leavin' alone
