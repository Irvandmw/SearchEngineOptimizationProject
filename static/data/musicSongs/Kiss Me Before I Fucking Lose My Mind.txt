Lyrics:


I
Should have told
You how I really feel
A little in advance

Then I
Would've had some time
To go and work it out
I think I've lost my chance

For the last 3 years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you'd figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face

Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you'd ever say "goodbye"
If I didn't say it first

I'm done
Playing these games
I can't believe what I'm about to say
I won't tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I
Fucking lose my
Mind

No
No more nights
Drinking to my loneliness
Up till 2 AM

No
No more waiting
Pacing round the bar
Hoping that you might walk in

For the last 3 years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you'd figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face

Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you'd ever say "goodbye"
If I didn't say it first

I'm done
Playing these games
I can't believe what I'm about to say
No I won't tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I
Fucking lose my mind

Oooo...

I'm done
Playing these games
I can't believe what I'm about to say
'Cause I would rather die
Than feeling this inside
Tricks played on my mind
No I would rather die
Than just tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I
Fucking lose my
Mind
