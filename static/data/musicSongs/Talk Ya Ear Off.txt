Lyrics:


[Verse 1]
I got what you want, waaant
Girl I want you, so grab a couple a friends
And let's go out
And if youâre nasty Iâm nasty too,
Iâve got a whole section already reserved for you
So bring your pretty ass over, to me

[Chorus]
I say, Iâm gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
I wanna talk ya ear off, girl
Got another rhythm leading to the floor,
Iâm gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Donât talk my ear off
Will you follow me to the floor,

[Verse 2]
Girl I got your heart
Heart! I know what to do, baby
Just sit that pretty thing on my lap, on my lap,
That big oh booty
Iâm telling the truth, baby
Itâs only you that I gotta have
So bring your pretty ass over, to me

[Chorus]
I say, Iâm gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
I wanna talk ya ear off, girl
Got another rhythm leading to the floor,
Iâm gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Donât talk my ear off
Will you follow me to the floor,

You know it, you know it baby

[Chorus]
I say, Iâm gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
I wanna talk ya ear off, girl
Got another rhythm leading to the floor,
Iâm gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Gonna talk ya ear off, girl
Donât talk my ear off
Will you follow me to the floor
