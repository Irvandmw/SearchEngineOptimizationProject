Lyrics:


I know you think I'm crazy, cryin' out lazy
Winning days are through
Am I mistaken, have you been taking
More than you can use

And by the way, the loser babe is you

I hear you think I'm used, overworked and abused
If what you say is true
Why'd ya do me, I thought ya knew me
I've never been your fool

And by the way, the loser babe is you

It's a losers game, playing to win
It's all over before you begin
It's another day when you clear it away
It's just a lonely rendevouz with an old friend

And by the way the loser babe is you

It's a losers game, playing to win
It's all over before you begin
It's another day when you clear it away
It's just a lonely rendevouz with an old friend

I never meant any harm, I don't want to alarm you
You broke the only rule
Am I mistaken, have you been taking
More than you can use

And by the way the loser babe is you
By the way the loser babe is you
By the way the loser babe is you
