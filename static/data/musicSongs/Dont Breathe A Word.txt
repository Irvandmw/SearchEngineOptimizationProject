Lyrics:


Please don't go tellin' her that I love her
I just don't want her to discover
I know she'd only think it's all too absurd
It's a secret, don't breathe a word

If only she knew what I've been wishin'
I'd be in a very bad position
I'd have the saddest tale of woe ever heard
It's a secret, don't breathe a word

I've been tryin' to figure out a new technique
My new plan is a smooth plan
But my technique is a little bit weak

As long as she doesn't suspect a thing
She'll be receptive when I spring
My big secret, don't breathe a word

About love, about love
About love, about love
About love
