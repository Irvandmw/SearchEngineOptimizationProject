Lyrics:


Hello my dear, not mad the stars are bright
And if I have my way, they'll all be yours tonight
So while the moon is high, just let me hold you close till our shadows get into the light
My heart never lies

I dare you, dare you, to trust me
I dare you, dare you, to trust me

Empty spaces filled of your worry mind
Don't let the fear keep us from running wild, we'll be alright
Just let me hold you close to all of your ghost in the fire
My heart never lies

I dare you, dare you to trust me
I dare you, dare you to trust me

Don't you worry about, you'll never be without my love, my love
Don't you worry about, you'll never have to doubt my love, oooh my love

I dare you, dare you to trust me
I dare you, dare you to trust me
I dare you, dare you to trust me, yeah
I dare you, dare you to trust me
