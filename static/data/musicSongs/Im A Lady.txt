Lyrics:


I talk with a mouth full
But I couldn't be sweeter
Yep, I'm a cutie in my own way
I won't play, follow the leader

And I don't look like them (But I ain't worried about it)
I don't talk like them (But I ain't worried about it)
But I know I'm a gem
I ain't worried about it, I ain't worried about it
'Cause I'm a lady

'Cause I'm a lady
Come on! I'm a, I'm a lady

All my girls, show them you're a lady
Tell the world, say you're proud to be a lady

I know I laugh too loud
And I might cry too much
To all those judgy eyes
I got a whole lotta love

'Cause I don't roll like them (But I ain't worried about it)
I don't move like them (But I ain't worried about it)
I know I'm a gem
But I ain't worried about it, I ain't worried about it
'Cause I'm a lady

'Cause I'm a lady
Yeah, I'm a, 'cause I'm a lady

All my girls, show them you're a lady
Tell the world, say that you're proud to be a lady
All my girls, show them you're a lady
Tell the world, say you're proud to be a lady

And I'm pretty, I'm pretty cute and I'm pretty smart
And when I break it down, it's a work of art
And if you feel the same, can you participate?
I wanna see you shake, I wanna hear you say

Say I'm pretty, I'm pretty cute and I'm pretty smart
And when I break it down, it's a work of art
And if you feel the same, can you participate?
I wanna see you shake, I wanna hear you say

And I don't look like them
I don't talk like them
I know I'm a gem
I ain't worried about it, I ain't worried about it
'Cause I'm a lady

I don't roll like them (But I ain't worried about it)
I don't move like them (But I ain't worried about it)
I know I'm a gem
But I ain't worried about it, I ain't worried about it
'Cause I'm a lady

(Yeah) 'cause I'm a lady
(Hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
I'm a, I'm a lady

All my girls, show them you're a lady
Tell the world, say that you're proud to be a lady
All my girls, show them you're a lady
Tell the world, say that you're proud to be a lady
