Lyrics:


I was off the perky like yesterday
I told all my brothers we gon get this cake
Back to fuckin hoes it's another day Tell me how rockin I don't play
Bronem pulled up, shoot, he made your block hot I be in the crib with Gucci flipflops
Moved cribs to just to trap out a new spot

I'm finna bust at you like fuckin b dot
I just fuck them then I pass em ooh 2 tone rings and Gucci links too
Ooh Ridin deep slidin with a fuckin tool
I see you yeah we got money too
Me and all my niggas all my niggas rock stars (skrrt, skrrt)
Me and all my niggas drip hard (too hard)
Nigga JD ridin from the start (from the start)

Ask yo bitch yeah lil mosey is a star
I got bands I'm cashin out
I bust down 30 in my mouth
I did this my self
Can't hand it
Niggas lame askin for a band out
Bad bitch to the room with we poppin rose
I just dropped sum lean just because my throat ache
I know you a hoo I can't fuck no way
And I got the front end it hit today

I'm finna bust at you like fuckin b dot
I just fuck them then I pass em ooh 2 tone rings and Gucci links too
Ooh Ridin deep slidin with a fuckin tool
I see you yeah we got money too
Me and all my niggas all my niggas rock stars (skrrt, skrrt)
Me and all my niggas drip hard (too hard)
Nigga JD ridin from the start (from the start)
