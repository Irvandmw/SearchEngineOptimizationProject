Lyrics:


I'm counting wallpaper roses all around the room
Wallpaper roses painted with gloom
I've been so heartsick and lonely watching the door
Crying my heart out pacing the floor
I'm counting wallpaper roses over and over again
I've counted two thousand six hundred and ten
You are the only one come back and bring the sun
And make my wallpaper roses bloom again
I'm counting wallpaper roses over and over again...
And make my wallpaper roses bloom again
