Lyrics:
Lyrics:


My dreams are blue
My schemes are blue
Everything I look at
Seems to turn to blue
Except the sky above
As gray as it can be
That follows me
An' my broken hearted song
Marchin' along to the blues

The traffic lights shine overhead
They're the deepest blue
Instead of green an' red
Especially on the corner
Where we used to meet
I hear the beat
Of a broken hearted song
marchin' along to the blues

[Instrumental Interlude]

You promised me
You would never make me cry
But look whatcha did
When you said goodbye
The moon is blue
The stars are blue
Ever since they heard the news
That we were through
They can't believe
That after making you my own
I'd be alone
With a broken hearted song
Marchin' along to the blues

[Instrumental Interlude]

Oh, look whatcha did
When you said goodbye
The moon is blue
The stars are blue
Ever since they heard the news
That we were through
They can't believe
That after making you my own
I'd be alone
With a broken hearted song
Marchin' along to the blues

With a broken hearted song
Marchin' along to the blues
