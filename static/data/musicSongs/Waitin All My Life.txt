Lyrics:


Hey, hey, hey
Mmm, na-na-na-na
Aye!

I've been waitin', waitin'
I've been waitin' for all my life
I've been waitin', yes I've been waitin'
I've been waitin' for all my life (I've been)

When I, when I was younger thought that love was overrated, woah
But now I, I can't help it know I'm so infatuated, yeah
Uh

And I can't believe this feeling I've got
Whatever you do well don't ever stop
My heart, you got it pouring like champagne
I'm feeling tipsy off of the thought of the moment when you take your clothes off
And I'm down, because it feels like...

I've been waitin', waitin'
I've been waitin' for all my life
I've been waitin', yes I've been waitin'
I've been waitin' for all my life (I've been)

And my momma, momma told me "take your time and just be patient, woah
Because love will find you with a kiss that makes you so intoxicated", yeah-aye

You get to me emotionally
Then you break it down so sexually
My love, you got it pouring like champagne
I'm feeling tipsy off of the thought of the moment when you take your clothes off
And I'm down, because it feels like...

I've been waitin', waitin'
I've been waitin' for all my life
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
I've been waitin' for all my life (I've been waitin')

Hey, hey
Yes I've been, I've been waitin'
Yes I've been, I've been waitin' all my life
I've been, I've been waitin'
Yes I've been, I've been waitin'
I've been, I've been waitin' for all my life
Yeah

You get to me emotionally
Then you break it down so effortlessly
My love, you got it pouring like champagne
I'm feeling tipsy off of the thought of the moment when you take your clothes off
And I'm down, because it feels like...

I've been waitin', waitin'
I've been waitin' all my life
I've been I've been waitin', waitin'
I've been waitin' all my life (I've been waitin')

I've been, I've been waitin'
Yes I've been, I've been waitin'
I've been, I've been waitin' all my life
I've been waitin'
I've been, I've been waitin' (hey, hey)
I've been, I've been waitin' all my life (ye-yeah)
I've been waitin'
I've been, I've been waitin' (hey, hey, woo!)
I've been, I've been waitin' all my life
I've been waitin' (I've been waitin')
I've been, I've been waitin' (yeah I've been waitin')
I've been, I've been waitin' (I've been waitin' all my...)
