Lyrics:


I put up my hair
Let's get out of here
I got nowhere
Nowhere to go tonight
I'm shaking now
I can't control myself
Gotta get out
And find that grey light

There's no turning back
Gotta go where nobody else went
Time alone is time well spent

I wanna be
All I wanna be
Free to fly
Free to fly
And I wanna see
All I wanna see
You free to fly
Away

Ready to go
Gotta fly outta here
'Cause that's all I know
No more drowning in tears
This isn't the start
Gotta leave what's behind
Who would've find
Gotta find the real light

And there's no turning back
Gotta go where nobody else went
The time alone is time well spent

I wanna be
I wanna be
Free to fly
Free to fly
I wanna see
I wanna see
You free to fly

It's not much longer
Time's running faster
Than you are
So let's make this last
Don't look to the past
Find there's love

I wanna be
All I wanna be
Free to fly
I wanna see
All I wanna see
You free to fly
I wanna be
I wanna be
Free to fly
Free to fly
I wanna see
All I wanna see
You free to fly
I wanna be
All I wanna be
Free to fly
Free to fly
I wanna see
All I wanna see
You free to fly
Away
