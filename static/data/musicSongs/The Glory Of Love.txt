Lyrics:


You've got to give a little,take a little.
And let your poor heart to break a little.
That's the story of.
That's the glory of love.

You've got to laugh a little,cry a little.
Until the clouds roll by a little.
That's the story of.
That's the glory of love.

As long,as there's the two of us.
We,ve got the world and all it's charms.
And when the world is through with us.
We've got each others arms

You've got to win a little,lose a little.
And always have to blues a little.
That's the story of.
That's the glory of love.

As long,as there's the two of us.
We,ve got the world and all it's charms.
And when the world is through with us.
We've got each others arms

You've got to win a little,lose a little.
And always have to blues a little.
That's the story of.
That's the glory of love.
