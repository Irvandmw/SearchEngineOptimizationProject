(Talkin' it and doin' it are different stories)
(For real, for real)

I blow money on my bitch
Hey kitty kitty
Bad bitch, my city
Ain't bad, it's a dead end
I fuckin' admit it
Can't wait to hit it
Money, I'm gon' get it

I'm so terrifâic, that's the way I'm livin'
That's the way you're hearin' it?
Always be givin'
Better decision
Flooded my wrist
You ain't gon' get missed
Hit it with a slam dunk
That pussy clean

When I pop that Perc and fuck that bitch
Make her go (Yeah, yeah)
In the sheets, call the hotel lobby
Tell 'em we need clean sheets
Knock that pussy out, I kill it
Tell it rest in peace
And if it smell like water, fuck it
I'll kiss it to sleep

I'm the realest, feel like 2pac
Call me Makaveli
It really ain't shit 3 broke nigga could tell me
I'm walkin' around with a chopper, it heavy
Pop the lil' boy, sound like confetti
Shot the lil' boy, now he in Heaven
I only like girls, so my mama don't worry
She hate on my clothes, 'cause she said I look girly
And fuckin' these bitches, I know y'all ain't worried
Don't play that position, you gon' miss your jersey
She was a good girl, now she turning
Want a rich nigga? Gotta earn him (Yeah)

Want a rich nigga? Gotta earn
And I'm straighter than a damn perm
Want a millionaire? Then wait your turn
(Yeah)

Talking it and doing it are different stories
I be doing it, not talking it, that's mandatory
Countin' up blue faces, watching a lil' Rick and Morty
Just chillin', I'm still the richest nigga in the buildin'
New car got stars in the ceiling
Amiri, my jeans, rip in the denim
New gun, his head rip when it hit him
Fuck her, then leave him not sentimental
Pussy good, I'ma go in raw when I hit nigga
Go ahead, suck it through the drawers for nigga

And take my body case if I get it
Walk hard with the Actavis, I'm sippin'
I still got Molly in my system
I still got Xanny's on my mental
It's been a couple years since I quit 'em
I don't wanna relapse, but I may relapse
That feeling, I miss it
I mean, Percs are cool, but I think I'm
Getting sick of 'em

When I pop that Perc and fuck that bitch
Make her go (Yeah, yeah)
In the sheets, call the hotel lobby
Tell 'em we need clean sheets
Knock that pussy out, I kill it
Tell it rest in peace
And if it smell like water, fuck it
I'll kiss it to sleep
