Lyrics:


Have you seen my Mississippi dreamboat
Long and lean with half-closed eyes
She's got men swarming all around her
Just like flies

When you see my Mississippi dreamboat
You'll agree that she walks by
There goes one gorgeous hunk of woman my o my

She wears rhinestone bracelets (she wears rhinestone bracelets)
Red fox stole (red fox stole)
Tight black satin (tight black satin)
And walks with a roll (and walks with a roll)
Everything swaying (everything swaying)
Out of control

I'm a fool for Mississippi dreamboat
Just a fool each night at sea
'cause so far I have only seen her
In my dreams

She wears rhinestone bracelets (she wears rhinestone bracelets)
Red fox stole (red fox stole)
Tight black satin (tight black satin)
And walks with a roll (and walks with a roll)
Everything swaying (everything swaying)
Out of control

I'm a fool for Mississippi dreamboat
Just a fool each night at sea
'cause so far I have only seen her
In my dreams
(Mississippi dreamboat)
In my dreams
(Mississippi dreamboat)
In my dreams
(Mississippi dreamboat)
