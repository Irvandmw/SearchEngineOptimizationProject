Lyrics:


Got the top down, can't stop me now
Let's burn down a one-way highway
We both know where it goes
And I love it when you're here beside me

Just you and I, life's rushin' by
Baby we're alive

Let's hit a high
Let's, light up the sky
Let's, burn like a fire
Oh-oh-oh
Let's hit a home run
I love when you come
Let's get the job done
Oh-oh-oh
Take my hand and don't say a word
Let the universe do all the work
Kiss me like it's the last night on earth

Don't look back, been and done that
Let's go where they'll never find us
No one needs to know, where we're gonna go
Gonna leave it all, all behind us

Just you and I, life rushin' by
Baby we're alive

Let's hit a high
Let's, light up the sky
Let's, burn like a fire
Oh-oh-oh
Let's hit a home run
I love when you come
Let's get the job done
Oh-oh-oh
Take my hand and don't say a word
Let the universe do all the work
Kiss me like it's the last night on earth

Light up the sky
Let's burn like a fire!

Let's hit a high
Let's, light up the sky
Let's, burn like a fire
Oh-oh-oh
Let's hit a home run
I love when you come
Let's get the job done
Oh-oh-oh
Take my hand and don't say a word
Let the universe do all the work
Kiss me like it's the last night on earth

Light up the sky
Let's burn like a fire!
