Lyrics:


Yeah
That sounds kinda nice
Ow!
I like that
Uh-huh

It's time for us to take our flight, oh yeah
Just grab my hand and hold on tight, oh yeah

Come on, take a second
Take a ride with me
Listen to the breakdown
And you're feeling free
Come on, everybody
'Cause we're digging deep
Uh-huh

Come on, take a second
Take a ride with me
Listen to the breakdown
And you're feeling free
Come on, everybody
'Cause we're digging deep

Red hot lipstick
It turns me on, oh yeah
Red hot lipstick
Just check out my song, oh yeah
Mwah!

Red hot lipstick
Red hot lipstick
I like that

Red hot lipstick (hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot)
Red hot lipstick (hot, hot, hot, hot, lipstick)

Come on, take a second
Take a ride with me
Listen to the breakdown
And you're feeling free
Come on, everybody
'Cause we're digging deep
Mwah!

Hot... lipstick

Red hot lipstick
It turns me on, oh yeah
Red hot lipstick
Just check out my song, oh yeah

[Noterock:]
Something 'bout you got me lifted
Got me twisted
All emotional
You're hips are gifted
Red hot girl with red hot lipstick
Ask her to dance?
Huh, I insisted
(I like that)
Yeah, I figured you would
Lipstick on my neck
We up to no good
Don't say nothing
Just move to the beat
Before I know it
I'm in the passenger seat

Come on, take a second
Take a ride with me
Listen to the breakdown
And you're feeling free
Come on, everybody
'Cause we're digging deep
Uh-huh

Come on, take a second
Take a ride with me
Listen to the breakdown
And you're feeling free
Come on, everybody
'Cause we're digging deep

Red hot lipstick
It turns me on, oh yeah
Red hot lipstick
Just check out my song, oh yeah
Red hot lipstick
It turns me on, oh yeah
Red hot lipstick
Just check out my song, oh yeah
