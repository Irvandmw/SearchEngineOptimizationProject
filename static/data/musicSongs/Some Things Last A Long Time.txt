Lyrics:


Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright, bright as ever

Red is strong, but blue is true
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
I think about you often, often

I canât forget all the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

Itâs funny, but itâs true
And itâs true, but itâs not funny

Time comes and goes
All the while I still think about you
Some things last a long time

Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright, bright as ever

Things that we did are we forget
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time
