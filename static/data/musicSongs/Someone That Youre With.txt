Lyrics:


I reside in 209
You're in 208
You moved in last Friday night
And I just couldn't wait

So I tried to call across the hall
To ask you out someday
But a lineup formed outside your door
And I was way too late

Well, I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want
I'm sitting here in second place

Because somewhere
The one I wanna be with's with somebody else
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with
I wanna be that someone that you're with

And I can talk about it all day long
'Til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with
I've got to be that someone that you're with

And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there
With him somewhere
And just about to kiss
God, I wanna be that someone that you're with

Well, I hear your favorite songs
You sing along with everyday
And I borrow things that I don't need
For conversation sake

Last night I heard your key
It hit your lock at 4 AM
Instead of being out with me
You must be out with them

Well, I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want
I'm sitting here in second place

Because somewhere
The one I wanna be with's with somebody else
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with
I wanna be that someone that you're with

And I can talk about it all day long
'Til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with
I've got to be that someone that you're with

And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there
With him somewhere
And just about to kiss
God, I wanna be that someone that you're with

Well, somewhere
The one I wanna be with's with somebody else
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with

And I can talk about it all day long
'Til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with
I've got to be that someone that you're with

And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there
With him somewhere
And just about to kiss
God, I've got to be that someone thatâ
I wanna be that someone thatâ
I've got to be that someone that you're with
