Lyrics:


Back in the day we were just kids
Pawnshop guitars and big ideas
Moving paint cans and setting up amps
Two car garage ready to jam

We butchered Sweet Home and Smoke On The Water
Thought we were cool couldnât get any hotterâ¨
When the pretty girls on the block would come watch us play
We could hear em say

[Chorus:]
Yeah Yeah Yeah oh Yeah
We could hear em say
Yeah Yeah Yeah oh Yeah

Those good ol days turned into nightsâ¨
From smokey bars to our name in lightsâ¨
From a van to a bus playing sold out showsâ¨
A million miles down a million more to goâ¨
Having more fun than the law should allowâ¨
Twenty years later you can still hear the crowd scream
Let us hear ya sing

[Chorus:]
Yeah Yeah Yeah oh Yeah
Let us hear ya singâ¨
Yeah Yeah Yeah oh Yeah

To the crew setting up and tearing it down
Busting there butts on our little playground
Thank you boys for another great show
And to all the fans we want you know

Will never forget cause we know itâs trueâ¨
We wouldnât be here if it wasnât for youâ¨
Before we leave tonight tonight to rock another town
Come on and sing it loud

[Chorus:]
Yeah Yeah Yeah oh Yeah
Come on and sing it loud
Yeah Yeah Yeah oh Yeah

And Monday morning when ya go to work
You can say ya got the t-shirtâ¨
Yeah
