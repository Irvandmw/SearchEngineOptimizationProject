[Ariana Grande (Pharrell Williams):]
His melodies wash up on your mind just like seashells
To remember that we're all golden as well
Arturo Sandoval and the story that he tells
(Reminds me)

[Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams:]
Of El Dorado
Of El Dorado
Of El Dorado
Of El Dorado

[Ariana Grande (Pharrell Williams):]
His melodies wash up on your mind just like seashells
To remember that we're all golden as well
Arturo Sandoval and the story that he tells
(Reminds me)

[Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams:]
Of El Dorado
Of El Dorado
Of El Dorado
Of El Dorado

[Ariana Grande (Pharrell Williams):]
His melodies wash up on your mind just like seashells
To remember that we're all golden as well
Arturo Sandoval and the story that he tells
Reminds me

[Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams:]
Of El Dorado
Of El Dorado
Of El Dorado
Of El Dorado
