Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You make me strong
You make me weak
You lift me off my feet
You give me hope
When all my dreams
Seem like they're out of reach
You make me understand
The way the perfect love
Should be
You take me to a place
So high
I never wanna leave

Sometimes I think
Of all the things
I should have said
I hope it's not too late
I wanna make you understand

If the world crashes down over me
I know that my life is complete
'Cause I've held you
In my arms all night
'Cause I can't imagine
Life without you by my side

You whisper in my ear the words
"Just hold me close tonight"
And when the pain is holding me
Your touch just sets me free

Sometimes I think
Of all the things
I should have said
I hope it's not too late
I wanna make you understand

If the world crashes down over me
I know that my life is complete
'Cause I've held you
In my arms all night
'Cause I can't imagine
Life without you by my side

If the world crashes down over me
I know that my life is complete
'Cause I've held you
In my arms all night
'Cause I can't imagine
Life without you by my side
