Lyrics:


Mr Ruskin come and paint my picture
Weâre losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now whoâs your best friend?
Can you introduce me?
See I canât seem to even let you breathe

When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mindâs eye
Please let me forget that Iâm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me

Come and show me if you can
See I know youâre me
But I canât seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
Itâs psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick

When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mindâs eye
Please let me forget that Iâm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me
