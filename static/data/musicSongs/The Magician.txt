Lyrics:


I met a magician
He did magical things
He said he could turn any heart
That was sad in to one that sings

I told the magician
What had happened to me
My sweetheart and I had a quarrel
And now I was blue as could be

He asked me to close my eyes
Waved his wand in the air
I looked and to my surprise
My sweetheart was there

We kissed in the moonlight
Stars were twinkling above
I suddenly knew this was no magic trick
Just the magic of love

(He asked me to close my eyes)
(Waved his wand in the air)
(I looked and to my surprise)
(My sweetheart was there)

We kissed in the moonlight
Stars were twinkling above
I suddenly knew Thais was no magic trick
Just the magic of love
Just the magic of love
