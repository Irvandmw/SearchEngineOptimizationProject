Lyrics:


Now I stared at you
From across the room
Until both my eyes were faded

I was in a rush
I was out of luck
Now I'm so glad I waited

Well, you were almost there
Almost mine
They say love ain't fair
But I'm doing fine

'Cause I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it's you that I've waited for
And I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for

And it ain't gonna stop
No, it just won't stop

Now you were fire by night
But when the morning light comes
Comfortable as rain on Sunday

And I'm a lucky soul
That holds your hand so tight
Hope you hear this one day

Don't fool yourself
This is my truth

I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it's you that I've waited for
I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for

And it ain't gonna stop
It just won't stop

You take this hand
You take this heart
Stir my bones
From a thousand miles apart

Feels so cold without you
Like it's ten shades of winter
And I need the sun
No no

And I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it's you I've waited for
I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for

I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it's you that I've waited for
That I've waited for
I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for

And it ain't gonna stop
It just won't stop

Just won't stop
It just won't stop
No no no no

I swear it's you
I swear it's you
