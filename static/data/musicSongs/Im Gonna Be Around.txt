Lyrics:


It's been so long since we took the time
to share words from deep inside us
We're in our own world spinning our wheels
but you know how I feel

since the first time I took your hand
my love for you has just been growing
You always seem to understand 
You know how I am

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna love you til the end
I'm gonna be your very true friend
I wanna share your ups and downs
I'm gonna be around

When you're alone cause I'm away
don't be sad don't be afraid
I'm gonna turn my thoughts to you
like I always do

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna love you til the end
I'm gonna be your very true friend...

Catch you when you fall
Hold you when you're down
Sharing every moment
I wanna show you all I do
I believe I've found a miracle
in you

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna love you til the end
I'm gonna be your very true friend...
