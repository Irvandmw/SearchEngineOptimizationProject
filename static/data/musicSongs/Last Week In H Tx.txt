Lyrics:


MCV bitch
Aye, yeah, Stalli, summer '17, aye, yeah yeah

Okay, last week we was eatin' peanut butter jelly
Then I hit a lick, now we countin' Benja-mellys
Met him in the telly
Doing whatever he let me
I got love for my nigga like I'm Tionne off of Belly
Everybody thinkin' bad bitches got it easy
Well not the young ones on the grind gettin' greazy
Last week I had to make a hunnid dollas stretch
Every muthafuckin' night I was eatin' cheese eggs
Bitches tell stories 'cause these whores don't know me
See me by myself and got to trippin wit' yo' homie
I bet if you touch me, you go missin' like you Dory
Bitch that's why yo' nigga wanna kick it wit' the horsey

Uh-oh
I ain't never ran from a hoe
But I never let a bitch get a stain on my clothes (no-o)
Ridin' with my hands in the air
Got yo' nigga on the side with his fingers on my ooh-yeah yeah
Just bought a fifth of the Henn'
Pocket full of white man, named Benjamin
Looking for a hot boy with some fine friends
And yo' baby daddy wanna be my boyfriend

Bitch I'm from Texas, rock all the best shit
And I walk slow for them eyes tryna catch this
[?], make yo' whole clique lose it
Boy I know you wanna come kick it out in Houston
Bitch I'm from Texas
(Aye, aye H-town... H-town... H-town)
Bitch I'm from Texas
(7-1-3...2-8-1...8-3-2)

Okay, last week shit was kinda bad
I be goin' missin' when I'm tryna get a bag
I ain't got no time for no nigga tryna nag
'Cause I'm in love wit' my money like my name Mr. Krabs
And I got the winnin' ticket
Middle finger to them niggas and them bitches
You was wishin' that I'd stay slippin', throwin' all them peelings
You was dissin'
You ain't see the vision, like you eyes was Christian
Tryna curse me, I just pray to God they keep the devil off
Stalli don't bend or fold for no hoe
Don't give convo to those I don't know
Niggas try to play me close to get my info
Only time I disclose is when I disrobe
Never gave a fuck
Never gave a damn
And I'ma keep grindin' til these hoes know who I am
And I will come and take you for a hold of my hand
And bitch I bet not catch you lookin' at my fuckin' man
And when I'm with my crew, just be cool
Unless you wanna see some real bitches act a fool
And when I walk by
Niggas just sty
They only make 'em like this on the southside

Bitch I'm from Texas, rock all the best shit
And I walk slow for them eyes tryna catch this
[?], make yo' whole clique lose it
Boy I know you wanna come kick it out in Houston
Bitch I'm from Texas
(Aye, aye H-town... H-town... H-town)
Bitch I'm from Texas
(7-1-3...2-8-1...8-3-2)

Sippin' on mimosa, while he lick on my pinocha (ahh!)
Collar round his neck that say "Stallion" 'cause I own him
Haters never see me, I ain't hangin' where it's local
Drink my henny outta China
Black and boujee like I'm Oprah
Stallion for president
Snatchin' all the brethren
Foot up in a rap bitch ass without no lubricant
She's borin', I ain't hearing it
Who the fuck is hypin' this?
Something off about her like she missin' some ingredients (Urgh)
I'm sexual, no deviant
I like my man obedient
Don't want it missionary 'cause that's boring I need freaky shit
Walk up in the house and bust a pipe, get it leakin' shit
All up on my booty while you do me on some pinky shit
Yes I got big breasts, so I like to say shit wit' my chest
And I'm not sayin' I'm not humble, I just feel like I'm the best
Who's my competition? It's like all y'all that same bitch
And y'all be beefin', I'm a vegan
Stupid bitches make me itch
And I keep me a full set
I keep some ice around my neck
I keep a box around yo' nigga 'cause I keep his ass in check
Now I'm done wit' bein' broke
So don't get mad if I ain't spoke
Bitch I'm chillin out in Houston come and see me if you want
Ahh
