Lyrics:


Now some people are sayin' that I'm crazy
'Cause my real name is just Jesse James
Well I left them half rocked, hard knocked in Black Rock County
Just to ride on that New Delhi train

Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
Ridin' on that New Delhi line
Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
And left my love behind, left my love behind

I'm just a country boy without angels
I'm just a country boy without gold
And I've been to Silver City below the rainbow
Where they say I pillaged and I killed and I stole
Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
Ridin' on that New Delhi line
Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
And left my life behind, left my life behind

Well they say I killed a man named Smiley Dearden
Say I killed him with one of my guns
And I know that I did what I had not ought to
But I went on the run from what I'd done

Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
Ridin' on that New Delhi line
Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
And left my love behind, left my love behind

Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
Ridin' on that New Delhi line
Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
And left my life behind, left my life behind

Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
Ridin' on that New Delhi line
Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
And left my love behind, left my love behind

Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
Ridin' on that New Delhi line
Ridin' on that New Delhi freight train
And left my life behind, left my life behind
