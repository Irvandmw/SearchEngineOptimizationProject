Lyrics:


Do ya... do you think about me?
And do ya... do you feel the same way? Yeah
And do ya... do you remember how it felt?
'Cause I do. So listen to me, baby.

And I'm not tryna ruin your happiness,
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one for ya?
And I'm not tryna ruin your happiness, baby,
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one? Yeah

And do ya... do you think about me at all?
And do you... do you feel the same way?
Oh, tell me, babe.
And do ya... do you remember how it felt?
'Cause I do. So listen to me now. Oh oh

And I'm not tryna ruin your happiness,
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one for ya?
And I'm not tryna ruin your happiness, baby,
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one?

Do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever cross your mind?
Whoa oh oh

And I'm not tryna ruin your happiness,
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one for ya?
And I don't wanna, I don't wanna ruin your happiness, baby,
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one? Yeah

Oh Oh
Do I ever, said I, do I ever, said I, Do I?
Do I ever, said I, do I ever, said I? Oh oh oh oh
Do I ever... do I ever cross your mind?
Not tryna ruin your happiness at all.
