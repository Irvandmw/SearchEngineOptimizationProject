Lyrics:


Who's your little who-zis
Ah, your little turtle dove
Who's your little who-zis
Who do you love

Who's the little what's-it
That your dreaming of
Who's your little who-zis
Who do you love

Tell me who has you a-flutter
Whenever they're passing by
Melt your heart like butter
Oh me, oh my

Say, when you get the blue-zis
Who you thinking of
Ah, who's your little who-zis
Well, who do you love

Tell me who has you a-flutter
Whenever they're passing by
Well, melt your heart like butter
Oh me, oh my

Say, when you get the blue-zis
Who you thinking of
Ah, who's your little who-zis
Who do you love
