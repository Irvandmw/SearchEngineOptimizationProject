Lyrics:


I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me

Say it in a whisper
That baby it donât get much better
Would I like to see you again?

You name the day
And I will pick the city
Weâll fly away
Til then, call me when you miss me
If youâre asking if Iâd really like to see you again
I say, oh just say when

Tell me that you feel it
This you and me together
No one would believe me
Even I cannot believe it

You kiss me like you mean it
Oh baby, it donât get much better
Would I like to see you again?

Darling just say when

You name the day
And I will pick the city
Weâll fly away
Til then, call me when you miss me
If youâre asking if Iâd really like to see you again
I say ohâ¦just say when

Two different worlds
I thought theyâd keep us apart
Iâm ignoring my head
Follow my heart

Oh you pick the day, darling
And I will pick the city
Weâll fly away
Till then, call me when you miss me
I am willing to wait
Cause I just gotta see you again
Donât ask, no. just say when

Just say when

I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me
