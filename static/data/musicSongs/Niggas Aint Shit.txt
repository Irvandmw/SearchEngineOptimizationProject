Lyrics:


Man
This happened one, two, three times too much
These dumb ass niggas

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause

You can say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassin'
Can't pay tax, shoulda' wrote a book, coulda' made a bag
But he broke and he still waitin' 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doin' too much, relax a bit
Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Shoulda' known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Baby, you ain't shit, eat a laxative

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause

That's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so
Logical thinkin' is just something that you lack, so
What you even mad for? Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole
I'm not your mommy, nigga
Find a new hobby, nigga
Until your phone get picked up
Your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car
Or call your fuckin' mom
You should have paid my rent
Go get a fucking job

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
