Lyrics:


When you came along, oh happy was I
When you went away, I thought I would die
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
You know how much I need your touch
Maybe I love you a little too much
Oh baby, don't leave me this way

I thought you said our love was true
That you love me and I love you
But now you're gone and I am blue
Oh, what am I gonna do?

I just can't see why you wanted to go
You knew all along it would hurt me so
Oh baby, don't leave me this way

I thought you said our love was true
That you love me and I love you
But now you're gone and I am blue
Oh, what am I gonna do?

I just can't see why you wanted to go
You knew all along it would hurt me so
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
