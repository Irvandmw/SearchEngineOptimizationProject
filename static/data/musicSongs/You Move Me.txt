Lyrics:


I've been treated good, oh, and I've been treated bad
I've had better loving that anybody's ever had
But I've never been moved the way that you move me, baby
Oh, you move me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Happiness has found me now (happiness)
Ooh, and I've found myself in you, you give me more each day
There ain't nothing that I'd rather do than be moved by you, baby
The way that you move me, oh, you move me

Ain't not enough tears to cry (tears)
I will cry, ooh, baby I love you
There ain't not enough kisses to kiss you the way that I would kiss you
There's just not enough pride (pride) inside of me, baby
Oh, I want to make you see that if there is no use

Surely (surely)
Surely, baby (surely, baby)
Surely (surely)
There just ain't no need

Had my shell of loneliness
Well, and I've had my time to cry (yes, you had)
You'll feel this live in my next live too, boy
You are my one and only desire
But I ain't never been moved, baby, the way that you move me

There's not enough time (time) on the world (world)
To say, to say the way I love you ain't not enough joy (joy)
In this whole wide world to express myself if you will stay
Would you stay, baby, if you stay

Stay, baby, baby, baby, baby, would you stay?
Would you stay, aha, hey, baby
Stay with me, stay, stay with me, baby

I wonder would you stay now?
Would you stay, would you stay, yeah (stay with me baby, stay with me baby, you move me)
Now, I had a licky funky now, yeah (stay with me baby, stay with me baby, you move me)
This funky is funky now, this evenness meets this evenness

Said it's funky now, funky now, yeah, ah
This funky is funky now, this evenness meets this evenness
Said it's funky now, ooh ooh, ooh, yeah
Stay, baby, every baby

Stay baby, stay baby, stay baby, stay, yeah
