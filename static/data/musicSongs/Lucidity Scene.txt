Lyrics:


[Kai:] What'd you wanna be when you grew up?
[Thomas:] Honestly, a musician
[Kai:] What?
[Thomas:] I know man crazy right
[Kai:] Nah, what's crazy is original music hasn't been created since Earth
[Thomas:] I know man. Lucidity
[Kai:] What?
[Thomas:] Back then people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness.
Shit we took for granted was obvious: water, food supply.
It's insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise. I guess that's what I'm looking for
[Kai:] What, being able to make music?
[Thomas:] Not just that. If the laws are abolished following the migration - we're free dude
[Kai:] We're not slaves Thomas
[Thomas:] We aren't? You can't do anything outside the cause, not really.
That's why we watch the same movies and listen to the same music.
I mean don't get me wrong the catalogue is incredible, but we need... I don't know
[Thalia:] Something more?
[Thomas:] Yeah, somethin' more
