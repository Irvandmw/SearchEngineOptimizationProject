Lyrics:


They keep tryin but they can't stop us
Cause we got a love that keeps rising up
And yeah they fight it but we just proceed
To be who we are baby you and me

Life turns around, round and round
It goes ooh it's a mixed up world and that's for sure
We gonna get by on our own side by side
Love's all we need to be free
I gotchu, you got me

(In the mix)
(In the mix)

We keep it inspiring even though they set limits for us to follow
Won't let 'em break us, it's all so shadowy
Never stop striving and we gonna keep climbing up
Nah, we won't cower, we stayin' strong now
With super powers

Life turns around, round and round
It goes ooh it's a mixed up world and that's for sure
We gonna get by on our own side by side
Love's all we need to be free
I gotchu, you got me

Life turns around, round and round
It goes ooh it's a mixed up world and that's for sure
We gonna get by on our own side by side
Love's all we need to be free
I gotchu, you got me
