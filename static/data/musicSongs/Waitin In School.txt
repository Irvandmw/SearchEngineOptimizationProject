Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I been a-waitin' in school all day long
A-waitin' on the bell to ring so I can go home
Throw my books on the table, pick up the telephone
"Hello, baby, let's get somethin' goin'"

Headin' down to the drugstore to get a soda pop
Throw a nickel in the jukebox, then we start to rock
My school gal baby, gonna tell ya some news
You sure look good in them baby-doll shoes

Well, it's a-one, two, a-pull off my shoes
Three, four, get out on the floor
Five, six, come get your kicks
Down on the corner of Lincoln and a-forty-six

Yeah!

[Instrumental break]

I've been a-waitin' in school all day long
A-waitin' on the bell to ring so I could go home
Throw my books on the table, pick up the telephone
"Hello, baby, let's get somethin' goin'"

Headin' down to the drugstore to get a soda pop
Throw a nickel in the jukebox, then we start to rock
My school gal baby, gonna tell ya some news
You sure look good in them baby-doll shoes

Well, it's a-one, two, a-pull off my shoes
Three, four, get out on the floor
Five, six, come get your kicks
Down on the corner of Lincoln and a-forty-six

[Spoken:]
Yeah!
Well, let's go now!!

Well, it's a-one, two, a-pull off my shoes
Three, four, get out on the floor
Five, six, come get your kicks
Down on the corner of Lincoln and a-forty-six

You gotta move, start rockin' baby
A rockin', rockin' baby
Gonna rock all night, rock all night
Just wait 'n' see

Yeah!
