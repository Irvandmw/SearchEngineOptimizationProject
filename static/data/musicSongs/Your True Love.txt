Lyrics:


True love (your love)
True love (your love)
True love baby that's what you give me
True love (your love)
True love (your love)
True love baby that's what you give me

Well God made the world and he made it round
I got my baby and I'm glad I found
Her love was meant for me
And my baby she'll always be

She gives me true love (your love)
True love (your love)
True love baby that's what you give me

True love (your love)
Aw, true love (your love)
True love baby that's what you give me

Well the big and little, young and old
They all need somethin' to have and hold
When I found you I found out
You gave me loving I can't forget
You give me true love (your love)
Aw, true love (your love)
True love baby that's what you give me
Oh yeah, true love baby that's what you give me
