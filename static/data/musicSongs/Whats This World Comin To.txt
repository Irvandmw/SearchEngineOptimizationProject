Lyrics:


Why can't folks get along with one another
'Cause Jesus said you got to love your brother
Lord I seem to notice all the evil in the air
No one seems to really give a damn if it is there
Oh, what's this world comin' to
Hope for love, come on through, come on through
People finally get them together
Makin' life - Ooh - a whole lot better
Yeah, yeah
Some folks got a lot, and some are hungry
Well I said some folks have to live from day to day
Rich folks spendin' time just countin' money
Poor folks really ain't got much to say
What's this world comin' to
Hope for love, come on through, come on through
I said now people finally get them together
Makin' life - Ooh - a whole lot better
Yeah, yeah
What's this world
Comin' to
What's this world
Comin' to
What's this world
Comin' to
What's this world
Comin' to
What's this world
Comin' to
What's this world
Comin' to
Oh people got to get their thing together
Be no time to lose just time to die
All of us can make this world a better place to be
All of us can see how good it feels to be free
Woah, what's this world comin' to
Hope for love, come on through, me and you
People got to get it together
Makin' life - Ooh - A whole lot better
