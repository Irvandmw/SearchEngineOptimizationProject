Lyrics:


Thy people will be my people my love . . . 

Whither thou goest, I will go. 
Wherever thou lodgest, I will lodge. 
Thy people will be my people my love, 
Whither thou goest, I will go! 

For as in that story, long ago, 
The same sweet love story, now is so, 
Thy people shall be my people my love, 
Whither thou goest, I will go! 

Whither thou goest I will go, 

Wherever thou lodgest, I will lodge, 
Thy people will be my people my love, 
Whither thou goest I will go. . . 

For as in that story long ago, 
The same sweet love story now is so, 
Thy people shall be my people my love, 
Whither thou goest, I will go 

I will go . . .
