Lyrics:


I've been stuck here in the middle
Of the truth and feelin' alright
An abusive man can't catch him with his hands
He has a force of an eager mind
So you lie for your baby
So he got so many secrets to hide
But you can't do it for yourself now
Ain't that what bruises the pride

I was living
Preserving your name
All the time
Leaving mine in shame
And what you did will always remain

I'm still stuck in here in the middle
Of the truth and an easy time
Lord as he is it's too hard to hear
But I'm just trying to live my life
When you can't hide it anymore
Just to keep them all feeling good
The truth is so unpopular
Almost worth enduring the hurt

I was living
Preserving your name
All the time
Leaving mine in shame
And what you did will always remain

He'll say "if you love me then you'll do it"
And he'll find ya if you got those daddy issues
And if you kick my ass no one will ever have a clue
Just look at you
You look so strong baby
Hey and you'll always carry on
Cause the show must go on
No one will ever know
Cause he got ya
Ain't that truly alone
The long home
Yes
