Lyrics:


We're here in Mexico City, having a good time,
We're here in Mexico City, making all these rhymes,
We'll eat some beans and rice and stuff and make it all so great,
We'll eat some tacos, do you have chipotle here?

We're here in Mexico city
Making all these tunes

We're here in Mexico city
We wish you were here too
