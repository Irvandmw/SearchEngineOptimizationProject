Lyrics:


Your kiss, your touch, your hold
You know I want you all
The darkness in my soul tells me to let you go

And I need you tonight
But I'm blinded by lights
So I gotta learn to live without you

So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love

So please, New York (New York, New York)
Mend my broken heart tonight (New York, New York)
Cause I left the one I love
New York, take me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy

She never sleeps at night
Some nice you name her twice
Without you, I'm alive
But my heart is cold as ice

And I need you tonight
But I'm blinded by lights
So I gotta learn to live without you

So please, New York (New York, New York)
Mend my broken heart tonight (New York, New York)
Cause I left the one I love
New York, take me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy

I ran away from home
I ran to follow my dream
I ran away from he
Would he do this to me?
I needed a way out
I needed to figure how to get you here with me
Maybe you are my dream, oh

So please, New York (New York, New York)
Mend my broken heart tonight (New York, New York)
Cause I left the one I love
New York, take me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy
