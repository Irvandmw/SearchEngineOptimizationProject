Lyrics:


He was peekinâ through the window
We invited him on in
We gave him a drink and he said with a wink
âI needed that, my friendâ
He said itâs time to take a break
So let the good times begin
Cause there is music
And party till the end
Everybody was rockinâ and rollinâ on Christmas Day

Way too soon he said he had to leave
Had a long long way to go
The said
Well Iâm flying tonight
The forecast is heavy snow
And I swear I saw that red-nosed reindeer
He looked me right between the eyes
So he snapped the reins and heard in a flash
And disappeared in the sky
Everybody was rockinâ and rollinâ on Christmas Day

Even Santaâs reindeer was dancing on a boundless sleigh
When I see the jingle bells
They jingle all the way
Everybody was rockinâ and rollinâ on Christmas Day

Some people say that you donât believe me
But I as seen in you
I met the man and shook his hand
And every word I say is true

Everybody was rockinâ and rollinâ on Christmas Day

Even Santaâs reindeer was dancing on a boundless sleigh
When you see the jingle bells
I said jingle all the way
Everybody was rockinâ and rollinâ on Christmas Day
Everybody was rockinâ and rollinâ on Christmas Day
Everybody was rockinâ and rollinâ
Just canât seem to control it
Everybody was rockinâ and rollinâ on Christmas Day
