Lyrics:


Mhm, yeah, mhm, ooh
I'm just tryna' lean with you, baby
Can I just see my baby?
Can you walk it out? Can we?

I'm just tryna' lean with' you lately, can I just see my baby?
Can you walk it out? Can we talk it out?
I been wondering what's new
That's why I hit you often, I'm not clingy, I just feel for you

Heard you wanna ride for me
But is you gon' slide for me?
Bad lil' shawty she walk in the room, I be there from 5 to 3
Haven't seen you since I moved
You turned to a masterpiece
Takin' your heart, might actually
Twistin' the lock, got the master key
Whatchu tryna do baby?
We got bands, run through baby
Are you tryna come with' a young G?
Bike could ride, honestly
I'll show you what you wanna be, come fuck with' me (yeah)

I'm just tryna' be with you, baby
Can I just see my baby?
Can you walk it out?
Can we?
I'm just tryna' be with' you lately, can I just see my baby?
Can you walk it out? Can we talk it out?
I been wondering what's new
That's why I hit you often, I'm not clingy I just feel for you

Let her know when she fuckin' with' me
That my old hoes mean nothing to me
Pass to my bro, got a new one for me
Just YSL, Gucci, she got it from me
Whatchu' wanna be? I put my rings on
Hop in my whip, yeah
I'm right down the street (uh huh)
Whatchu' tryna do baby?
We got bands run through baby
Are you tryna come with' a young G?
Bike could ride, honestly
I'll show you what you wanna be, come fuck with' me (yeah)

I'm just tryna' lean with you, baby
Can I just see my baby?
Can you walk it out? Can we?
