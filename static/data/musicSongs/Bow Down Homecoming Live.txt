Lyrics:


Coachella
Thank ya'll so much for having us once again
I'm so honored to be on this stage tonight
And this next song is for all of my queens
Do we have any beautiful queens in the house tonight?
I want you to sing along if you know the lyrics
It's called Bow Down

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches

Bow down, bow bow bow down
Bow down, bow bow bow down
Bow down, bow bow bow down
I'm so crown, bow bow bow down
H-town

I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I'm coming down dripping candy on the ground
Coming down dripping candy on the ground
