Lyrics:


Iâve been counting days and
Iâve been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I donât want to jinx my luck
Iâve left it all behind me
And Iâve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Iâll pray for you and me and hope Iâm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Dreaming of you baby
Iâve been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
âCause Iâve been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I donât want to jinx my luck
Iâve left it all behind me
And Iâve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Iâll pray for you and me and hope Iâm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if youâve seen one
Iâd like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Iâll pray for you and me and hope Iâm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Iâll pray for you and me and hope Iâm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
