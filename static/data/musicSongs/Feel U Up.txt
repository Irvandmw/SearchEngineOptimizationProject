Lyrics:


I've been diggin' you for such a long time
You don't even know that I'm alive
Something 'bout the way you walk just really blows my mind
Sorry but I'm sick of all this jive
Ok?

Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

Something 'bout your body baby really get me hot
I'm sweating girl and it's all because of you
I don't want your credit cards or anything you got
Feel you up is all I wanna do
What do you say?

Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

I ain't looking for a one night stand
I only wanna feel you up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel you up
Physical attraction babe
It's what it's all about
Hot and cold reaction
Feel you up
Turn you out

Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

What's the verdict? I don't like suspense
How can you resist my burning touch?
Something 'bout the way you walk just really blows my mind
I never wanted anything so much
Ok?

Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

I've been diggin' on you (for such a long time)
I've been diggin' on you (I've been diggin' on you)
(I've been diggin' on you)

Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

I ain't looking for a one night stand
I only wanna feel you up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel you up

Feel you up sugar sugar
Sugar sugar

Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

Let me touch your body baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
