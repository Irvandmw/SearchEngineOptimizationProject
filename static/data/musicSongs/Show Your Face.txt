Lyrics:


Come on everybody straight to the place around me
And if you have Bacardi (?) what I'm preaching babe it's harmony (?)
So if you want to be my girl
You better show your face around my world
Woah ooh whoa ooh oh
And show your face to me

Come on all you people come and dance to these sounds tonight
And if the music overwhelms you then you know it's gonna be alright
So if you want to be my girl
You better show your face around my world
Woah ooh whoa ooh oh
And show your face to me

So let the funeral (?) know that the word is out
And if you hear what I'm saying then come on and shout with me
Cause every time I see your smiling face
The place, the bass, the music sets you free
So if you want to be my girl
You better show your face around my world
Woah ooh whoa ooh oh
And show your face to me
Woah ooh whoa ooh oh
And show your face to me

Haven't you ever listened to the tapes? 
We're guaranteed a record deal!
Our stuff is that good!
