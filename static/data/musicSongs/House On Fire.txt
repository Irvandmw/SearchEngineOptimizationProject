Lyrics:


I don't like to wait too long, to wait too long, wait too long
Bring it on and bring it strong, bring it baby

I feel the pain and it feels good,
I know it would
Your heart burns slow,
I feel the pain and I cry out, I cry out

I need you, I need you

Babe, I want to drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
I'm going on up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning

I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire

I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire

So take me to the heavens now
As we burn down, as we are found
Take me to the heavens now
My heart screams out

I need you, I need you

Babe, I want to drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
I'm going on up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning

I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire

I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire

Love me to the beat of a drum, to the beat of a drum yeah
Love me till the walls cave in yeah
Love me to the beat of a drum, to the beat of a drum yeah
Love me. I don't wanna save it.

Baby, I want to drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
I'm going on up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning

I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire

I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
Baby, I'm a house on fire
