Lyrics:


Dime quien es
No me puedes mentir
Te has enamorado de el
No lo quieres decir

Donde fue que te hizo sentir
Dime que te pudo dar
Que yo no te di 

Que puedo hacer se todo 
es terminado
Que puedo hacer se has 
me abandonado 

Falta tanto amor
entre tu y yo
Ya me has olvidado 

Falta tanto amor
entre tu y yo
Otro has encontrado

Falta tanto amor
entre tu y yo
Ya me has olvidado 

Falta tanto amor
entre tu y yo
Otro has encontrado

Dime quien es
ya no puedes fingir
esas lagrimas que caen no son para mi

Adonde fue que te hizo sentir
Dime que te pudo dar
Que yo no te di

Que puedo hacer
si ya lo has decidido
que puedo hacer
si todo esta perdido 

Falta tanto amor
entre tu y yo
Ya me has olvidado 

Falta tanto amor
entre tu y yo
Otro has encontrado

Falta tanto amor
entre tu y yo
Ya me has olvidado 

Falta tanto amor
entre tu y yo
Otro has encontrado
So much love lost
Tell me who he is
You can't lie to me
You are in love with him
You don't want to say

Where was it that he made you feel
Tell me what he gave you 
That I didn't give you

What can I do if everything 
has ended?
What can I do if you have 
abandoned me?

So much love lost
Between you and me
You've already forgotten me

So much love lost
Between you and me
That another has found

So much love lost
Between you and me
You've already forgotten me

So much love lost
Between you and me
That another has found

Tell me who he is
Now you can't pretend
These tears that fall are not for me

Where was it that he made you feel?
Tell me what he gave you 
That I didn't give you

What can I do - if you've already decided?
What can I do - 
if everything is lost?

So much love lost
Between you and me
You've already forgotten me

So much love lost
Between you and me
That another has found

So much love lost
Between you and me
You've already forgotten me

So much love lost
Between you and me
That another has found
