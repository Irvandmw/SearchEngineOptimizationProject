[Young Scooter:]
I get money, rite
Fuckin hoes, rite
Designer clothes, rite
Rite, rite
Hold it with the left, hit it with the right
You got a plug, rite
Forin whips, rite
Keep it G, rite

Freebands, rite
Young Scooter, rite
All these damb plays, now I got my set rite
Projects changed my whole life
Water whip everything is clean, goin get it rite
Sold a thousand pounds, sware I count the money rite
Police to the left, you know I turn right
Your life kinda boring, girl, I can make it rite
Young Scooter, and I got it rite

I get money, rite
Fuckin hoes, rite
Designer clothes, rite
Rite, rite
Hold it with the left, hit it with the right
You got a plug, rite
Forin whips, rite
Keep it G, rite

[Future:]
Walking with them bands, shoe game rite
Draped up in the Luie, yeah, you guessed rite
Dodgen all the cops, they can't see me, out of site
I just went platnom, make it rain all night
Move it to the left, put the money to the right
Freebands, Freebands, bitch, get it rite
Gucci on your face, I can get you so rite
Turn you to a star, baby girl, overnight

[Young Scooter:]
I get money, rite
Fuckin hoes, rite
Designer clothes, rite
Rite, rite
Hold it with the left, hit it with the right
You got a plug, rite
Forin whips, rite
Keep it G, rite

Wrist is froze, rite

15 real, 15 dummies, a hundred bands, rite
Whip game crazy, my finesse game rite
Fewch done got it rite, Corn done got it rite
Lewis on the left, Belly's on the right
Closet full of saggers, 50 bands in each pocket
Take off like a rocket, watch me, young shit

I get money, rite
Fuckin hoes, rite
Designer clothes, rite
Rite, rite
Hold it with the left, hit it with the right
You got a plug, rite
Forin whips, rite
Keep it G, rite
