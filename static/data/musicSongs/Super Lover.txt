Lyrics:


Oh oh, oh oh. Oh!
Your super lover.
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh!
Your super lover.

Black lights and designer blues
With my tattoos of I-love-yous.
I just put on these dancing shoes
To prove my love for you.

Iâm livinâ it up,
Secretly he notices Iâm playinâ it up
For him
Playinâ it up.
Iâm livinâ it up,
Dancinâ on the tables as the DJâs
Spinninâ it up
For me
Spinninâ it up
For me

When the sun goes down
And the care ends up
Itâs time for the show-oh-oh-oh
Playinâ you to the scene,
Make cake for the queen.
Iâm on a role-oh-oh-oh
Stare in my direction.
Iâm craving your attention
So nowâ¦

Go back to the beat.
Get up on your feet.
Gonna be your super lover.
Right back to the beat.
Get up on your feet.
Iâma be your super lover.
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh!
Your super lover.
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh!
Your super lover.

Too hot for the masses,
Sheâs on fire.
Think Iâm gonna let her burn.
Champagne in the glasses,
Flip the bottle, baby.
Come ânâ take your turn.
Sheâs on my radar.
Catch ya later
Cuz she knows
When I push the fader
She ainât leaving me alone.

Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

Iâm livinâ it up.
Dancinâ on the tables
Mister DJ spinninâ it up
With you.
Spinninâ it up
For you.

When the sun goes down
And the care ends up
Itâs time for the show-oh-oh-oh
Playinâ you to the scene,
Make cake for the queen.
Iâm on a role-oh-oh-oh
Stare in my direction.
Iâm craving your attention
So nowâ¦

Go back to the beat.
Get up on your feet.
Gonna be your super lover.
Right back to the beat
Get up on your feet
Iâma be your super lover.

Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh!
Your super lover.
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh!
Your super lover.

(Câmon, say it.)
Eh, eh, eh!
Look at that girl.
Look at that girl.
Look at thatâeh, eh, eh!
Look at that girl.
Look at that girl.
Hold up, hold up.
Take me where you get to know them.
Hold up, hold up.
Cuz theyâre trynna get my clothes off.

When the sun goes down
And the care is up
Itâs time for the show-oh-oh-oh
Playinâ you to the scene,
Make cake for the queen.
Iâm on a role-oh-oh-oh
Stare in my direction.
Iâm craving your attention.
So nowâ¦

Go back to the beat.
Get up on your feet.
Gonna be your super lover.
Right back to the beat.
Get up on your feet.
Iâma be your super lover.

Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh!
Your super lover. (Oh oh, oh oh-oh)
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh!

Your super lover. (Oh oh, oh oh-oh)
Oh oh, oh oh. Oh-oh!
Your super lover. (Oh oh, oh oh-oh)
