Lyrics:


There goes my baby goin' for a ride
Yeah, there goes my baby goin' for a ride
Well, I know she's lonesome if I'm not by her side

She's always talkin' on that telephone
Awww, she's always talkin' on that telephone
Well, she must be lonely 'cause she's at home alone

Well, time's a wastin' talkin' bout this gal
I love her so much, but I'll get along somehow

Yeah, we used to fight, and she'd call me a dirty dog
Awww, we used to fight, and she'd call me a dirty dog
Well, talkin' to that woman is like talkin' to a hollow log

Yeah!

There goes my baby goin' for a ride
Awww honey, there goes my baby goin' for a ride
Yeah, I know she's lonesome cause I'm not by her side

Well, my time's a wastin' talkin' 'bout this gal
I love her so much, but I'll get along somehow

Well, there goes my baby goin' for a ride
Awww, there goes my baby goin' for a ride
Yeah, I know she's lonesome cause I'm not by her side
Yeah, well I know she's lonesome if I'm not by her side
