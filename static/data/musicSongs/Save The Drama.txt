Lyrics:


[Chris Brown:]
Gun shots, we lots
Hennessy, I don't really like scotch
At the don when I'm talking to the dutch
And the man with the pockets like fam you up
Dippers and the wait notes
Black man says he's hit a lick, better keep your face down
Get loud when that kick sound
You miss it, don't count up
No tops, no tops
Go to collect, we in Paris when we shop
You gotta give the man props
Your girl love a man lots
Fuck it, I'm on that pussy like a rumpa
If I tag her, gotta have her have a bumper
All that pussy, got it for ya like a drug
And I know she got that wagon from her mama

Call it a homicide how she do
The guys in Jamaica, man jealous
Make me terrified
I can tell you skilled cause you using your melody
Oh, no no no no
Light another blunt then we gon' light up the floor
Smoking all that ganja you can smell through the door
Sex tape never, 'less she let me record
And I know where your head's at
Got your attitude from your mama
And I don't wanna set back
Just do me a favor and save the drama

[Tracy T:]
Get the baddest bitch and treat it like the worst
Popping the Henny, tripping if you pop the pussy first
We gon' fuck, I'm gon' fuck or we gon' fall in love
I will get 'em once, fucking, fucking with the plug
Bitches texting, I'm a dog fetching
Bitch I'm on, no flexing, fuck a 100 besties
See that's just for that extra Range, she'd to forget them
Your body's under my belt, just to make it official
I forget that he mission, never forget the pistol
Thinking all the way in, killing and leave the victims
I got trust issues, I might think you tripping
Really I be tripping, rolling with all the spitting
West is, this the gang, bitch you better catch it
'Fore you be over tested, rather pull up in a Bentley
Used to pull up in Chevys, I'm the kind that can get enough
I'm the kind that can get the paper cause I can't get enough nigga

[Chris Brown:]
Call it a homicide how she do
The guys in Jamaica, man jealous
Make me terrified
I can tell you skilled cause you using your melody
Oh, no no no no
Light another blunt then we gon' light up the floor
Smoking all that ganja you can smell through the door
Sex tape never, 'less she let me record
And I know where your head's at
Got your attitude from your mama
And I don't wanna set back
Just do me a favor and save the drama

[Kevin Gates:]
Big boy's girl, big boy's girl, he be pum pum, like the jay's girl
I done made love in the strangest places, I'm a real plug, move things on the daily
Like the mon in the morn' opposite, smoke the ganj and we poof everyday
I'm a rider, she a rider, I know the black man right on sight
Hit the high notes like Mariah
I done feel the bitch when the vibe is right
I'mma grow, I'mma get you high tonight
Balling up, whip the pussy, mine tonight
I can see you want me, pull you closely, song on silent, ignore the phone ring
Keep your hands on me, just get it, frisk my waistband, ass and titties
Keep me Miss Gates, don't do digits, my phone bling, just been 2 million
Maybach, low key, big ladies hit me, it's 36 Coupe, I'm whipping
Hair on trap, that's 3 more chickens, new boo game on fleek, room glistening
Chris be get me it through chickens, raps on lap, big shit I did it
Head to the back, lot of taps on chilling, matter of fact, big racks I get it
When the game on, they stop tripping, bullshit make a real nigga lose interest

[Chris Brown:]
Oh, no no no no
Light another blunt then we gon' light up the floor
Smoking all that ganja you can smell through the door
Sex tape never, 'less she let me record
And I know where your head's at
Got your attitude from your mama
And I don't wanna set back
Just do me a favor and save the drama
