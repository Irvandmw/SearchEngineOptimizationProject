Lyrics:


(Lips)

I'm feeling so nostalgic, nostalgic
Your lips are something magic, magic
I just wanna feel 'em one more time

I heard you got a new man, new man
Girl, why'd you go and do that, do that
Give that boy a little kiss goodbye

What I wouldn't give to feel those lips again
Feel them on my skin again
Why aren't you here with me now?
What I wouldn't do to hear them whispering
Goosebumps on my skin again
Why aren't you here with me now?
Why aren't you here with me now?

(Lips)

I know I'm always busy, busy
Non-stop city to city
You weren't ready for that high speed life

But it gets lonely on the tour bus, tour bus
And there's room here for the two of us, two of us
Just in case you ever change your mind

What I wouldn't give to feel those lips again
Feel them on my skin again
Why aren't you here with me now?
What I wouldn't do to hear them whispering
Goosebumps on my skin again
Why aren't you here with me now?
Why aren't you here with me now?

(Lips)

It's 3 am
Scrolling through the photos that you sent back then
Reading our old messages, remembering
And all I wanna do right now is call you
But I know that I can't call you
God, I wish that I could call you

What I wouldn't give to feel those lips again
Feel them on my skin again
Why aren't you here with me now?
What I wouldn't do to hear them whispering
Goosebumps on my skin again
Why aren't you here with me now?
Why aren't you here with me now?
(Lips)
Why aren't you here with me now?
(Lips)
Why aren't you here with me now?
