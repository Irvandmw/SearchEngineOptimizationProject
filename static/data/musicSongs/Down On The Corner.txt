Lyrics:


Early in the evening just about supper time
Over by the courthouse theyâre starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playing
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky, thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playing
Bring a nickel, tap your feet.

Down on the corner, out in the street,
Willy and the Poorboys are playing
Bring a nickel, tap your feet.

You donât need a penny just to hang around
But if youâve got a nickel, wonât you lay your money down?
Over on the corner thereâs a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playing
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playing
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playing
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Tap your feet
Willy and the Poorboys are playing
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
