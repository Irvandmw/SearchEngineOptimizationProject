Lyrics:


How I love to hear the organ
In the chapel in the moonlight
While we're strolling down the aisle
Where roses entwine

How I love to hear you whisper
In the chapel in the moonlight
That the lovelight in your eyes
Forever will shine

Til the roses turn to ashes
Til the organ turns to rust
If you never come I'll still be there
Til the moonlight turns to dust

How I love to hear the choir
In the chapel in the moonlight
As they sing "Oh Promise Me"
Forever be mine

(Til the roses turn to ashes)
Til the organ turns to rust
(If you never come I'll still be there)
Til the moonlight turns to dust

How I love to hear the choir
In the chapel in the moonlight
As they sing "Oh Promise Me"
Forever be mine
In the chapel in the moonlight
