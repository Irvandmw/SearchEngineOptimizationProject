Lyrics:


When you said goodbye I made up a lie told every one that I knew
Our love was not real so I played a field and that I never loved you
I put up a front and walked down the street foragin' a smile at the time
And nobody knows I'm missin' you so it's drivin' me out of my mind

The middle of the night is when I cry
The middle of the day is when I lie
Tell everyone that I'm doing fine
But the middle of the night is my cryin' time

All of our friends ask where I've been they haven't seen me around
I just give a wink and I'm hopin' they think I've been out paintin' the town
Sometimes it seems alone in my dreams I'm holdin' you once again
When I awake it's so hard to take and that's when the teardrops begin

Oh the middle of the night is when I cry...
I put up a front and walked down the street...

The middle of the nigh is my cryin' time
The middle of the day is my lyin' time
I tell everyone that I'm doing fine
But the middle of the night is my cryin' time
(The middle of the nigh is his cryin' time)
The middle of the nigh is my cryin' time
The middle of the nigh is my cryin' time
