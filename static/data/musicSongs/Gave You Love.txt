Lyrics:


This here is expensive linen
Table wear with the Versace in it
I'm in able care but I'm barely livin'
Oh, yeah, I'm a millionaire so excuse the stares
I'm gettin' high
Let's play a game of truth
Maybe it's something that I can't handle
When's the last time that the shit hit the roof?
And I was the only one takin' the blame for it?
I guess it's my fault 'cause I shoulda knew
You not the queen to my throne, how the fuck you ride in my coupe?
I keep sayin' I'm grown, but it takes two
I guess I'll read it in the mornin' on that front page news
That bullshit

Oh, hold on
W-Wait a minute
I told you I was a simple man
But you lost one
That pushed the limit
You might never get it back again, oh, woah

Girl, before you came along
I was comfortable with just doing my thing
I had a million girls before
You walked through the door, look how you made me change
I did all of this for you
You were never true
Girl, you know you shady
I never thought I'd see the day
Give my heart away
Now I'm getting faded

I gave you love, you gave me nothing
What more you want?
At first you wanted me to leave
Now you don't
Sick of the back and forth
The gas about to blow up
Girl, you ain't listening
Shut up with all that bitching
It's all in your mind, so

Get your mind right
Oh
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Get it right
Uh, get your mind right
Oh, woah
What? Yeah, get your mind right

It's lonesome when I'm not in it
But we'll never be the same again
Now the love's gone and you ain't feel it
Guess I just don't know how to pretend
Oh, woah

Girl, before you came along
I was comfortable with just doing my thing
I had a million girls before
You walked through the door, look how you made me change
I did all of this for you
You were never true
Girl, you know you shady
I never thought I'd see the day
Give my heart away
Now I'm getting faded

I gave you love, you gave me nothing
What more you want?
At first you wanted me to leave
Now you don't
Sick of the back and forth
The gas about to blow up
Girl, you ain't listening
Shut up with all that bitching
It's all in your mind, so

Get your mind right
Oh
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Get it right
Uh, get your mind right
Oh, woah
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Get your mind right
Oh
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Get it right
Uh, get your mind right
Oh, woah
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Baby
