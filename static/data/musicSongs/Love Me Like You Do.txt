Lyrics:


Love me like you do
Love me like you do
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby
Teach me, teach me, teach me
Show me, show me, show me
The way to your heart

Oh, my baby, baby
I'm begging, lady, lady
Put me in the middle
That's where I'm 'a start

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
Our bodies touching while you

Love me like you do
Love me like you do
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby
Let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, let me
Be all you desire

Pretty baby, baby
I'm begging lady, lady
Take me to the top now
And I'll take you higher

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
Kissing on your neck while you

Love me like you do
Love me like you do
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

Alright, OK
Right there, that way
'Cause when you love me, I can feel it
And when your heart beats, I can hear it

Be quiet, don't say a word
Don't say none, girl, I'm all yours
Love me like you do but let me go first
Listen to these words right here

Love me like you do,
Love me like it's new
Love me like you love me,
Like there's nothing left to lose

We'll hop up in a Benz,
If you're tryna cruise
Hop up in the bed,
Baby, if you're tryna snooze

Louis V. shoes, look at me, do it
Got a lot of secrets, baby, can you guess clues?
And if you had a choice I know what you'd choose
You'd choose me, right?

Love me like you do
Love me like you do
Like you do
Love me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Love me tight and don't let go

What am I to do do do?
Love me like you do, you do
Like you do
Love me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Love me tight and don't let go

No no no no, no no no no no no no no no no, yeah.

Love me like you do, do, do, do, do
Love me like you do, do, do, do, do, do, do...
Huh. Yeah.
