Lyrics:


The stars may deceive you, may vanish and leave you
Be smart, only trust your heart
The breeze softly sighing
In truth, may be lying
Be smart, only trust your heart

The warmth of her kisses
May teach you what bliss is
But this is a faithless lover's heart
Only trust your heart, not the firelight
That comes from the starlight
Be smart, only trust your heart

The warmth of her kisses
May teach you what bliss is
But this is a faithless lover's heart
Only trust your heart, not the firelight
That comes from the starlight
Be smart, only trust your heart
