Lyrics:


I love you (I love you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I love you too (and I love you)
Baby will you call me the moment you get there?
Hey baby, um-hum

And I love you (I love you)
And I love you too (I love you)
And I love you (and I love you)
Baby will you (call me)
Call me (the moment)
The moment (you get there)
You get there? yeah, yeah, baby, yeah

My dearest, my dearest of all darling (ah-ooo)
I know, I know, I know, I know weâve got to part (ah-ooo)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
It really doesnât hurt me that bad yeah (ah-ooo)
Because youâre takinâ me with you
And Iâm keepinâ you right-a here in my heart

Itâs all because I love you (I love you)
Woo-hoo, and I love you (I love you)
And I love you too (and I love you)
Baby will you call me the moment you get there, baby?
Will you do that? Will you do that for me now?

Oh-oh-oh-oh, call me (call me)
Call me the hour (the hour)
Call me the minute (the minute)
The second that you get there (call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, baby)
Baby (call me)
Call me the hour (the hour)
Call me the moment you get there? (donât forget,donât forget about me baby)
No donât forget about me baby (baby)
I love you (baby)
Call me (call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, baby)
Call me baby (call me)
Call me the hour (the hour)
Call me the minute, the moment, the second (call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, baby)
Yeah, call me baby (the minute)
Call me the minute just (second)
Second, moment, hour
