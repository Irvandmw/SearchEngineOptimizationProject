Lyrics:


[Chamillionaire talking]
Chamillitary mayne (Fire Drill) Chamillitary mayne (Fire Drill)
you already know who it is Major(Fire Drill) Payne
cuz I stay bringing the majors pain, (Mo Fire)
hold up right now class is in session (Mo Fire)
so what we need to do is run a fire drill
real drill quick y'all know the routine, (Fire Drill) 
stop drop now roll (Fire Drill) stop drop now roll

[Verse]
...Chamillitary boy I run this, Aye

They told me Koopa you da best and then I said I know
it's the Mixtape Messiah Show so here it go part 4
revenge is a dish that is best served cold
so I walked into the kitchen and made 'em turn off the stove (woo)
how the heck you askin me whether or not I'm the real
I been terrorising y'all before I ever gotta deal (real)
backyard a little bigger than a soccer field
I been on so many beaches I forgot how socks should feel (ha)
album coming put the king on ya gift list (yeah)
rip ya pink slip cuz I'm too sick to be dismissed (yeah)
F what you think I know I'm lyrically gifted
like a kid that opened up a rap booklet on Christmas
you win and den you lose and they just say that's life
till you pull out that Ferrari den they say (that's nice) Screwed
they say Chamillionaire fell off and I just said that's right
I was standing on my money and fell 15 flights
