Lyrics:


(Little lovely one, little lovely one, little lovely one)
Little lovely one won't you tell me I'm the one
Won't you tell me I'm the one for you
Don't you realize you got me hypnotized
And everybody knows it but you
When you're walking down the street a-scuffling your feet
Don't you know you look so fine
You're such a living dream like peaches and cream
I can't get you off of my mind

Little lovely one won't you tell me I'm the one
Tell me I'm the one for sure
You don't answer your phone
I'm gonna follow you home
Be a knock on your door

When you're walking down the street a-scuffling your feet
Don't you know you look so fine
You're such a living dream like peaches and cream
I can't get you off of my mind

Little lovely one won't you tell me I'm the one
Won't you tell me I'm the one for you
If you don't answer your phone
I'm gonna follow you home
There's gonna be a knock at your door
Gonna be a knock at your door
There's gonna be a knock at your door
