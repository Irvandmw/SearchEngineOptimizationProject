Lyrics:


Can you handle 'em, handle 'em, handle my curves?
Can you handle 'em, handle my curves? (baby)
I said can you handle 'em, handle 'em, handle my curves?
Baby can you handle my curves?
Listen up gentlemen

Yo, tell me have you ever been with a thick girl?
Do you wanna go for them stick girls?
Well let me show you baby, it's a big world
I got a treat for you (Happy Birthday!)
I got something you can grab ahold of
There ain't nothing you should be afraid of
We can call it something, more than love
Baby, I got a treat for you

'Cause I look good, look good (look good, look good)
Even with my clothes on the floor
I look good, look good (look good, look good)
So don't you wanna call me yours?

'Cause I got curves and I know how to use 'em
I got curves with no plan to lose 'em
'Cause I love who I am
So are you the man, the man who can handle my curves?

Can you handle 'em, handle 'em, handle my curves?
Can you handle 'em, handle my curves?
I said can you handle 'em, handle 'em, handle my curves?
Baby, can you handle my curves?

You wanna love 'em? (Yeah)
You wanna hug 'em (Uh-huh)
You wanna name 'em (Yup)
You tryna claim 'em (Yeah)
And if you're man enough for my lady lumps
Then I got a treat for you!

'Cause I look good, look good (look good, look good) (I look good)
Even with my clothes on the floor (yeah baby)
I look good, look good (look good, look good)
So don't you wanna call me yours?

'Cause I got curves and I know how to use 'em (Uh-huh)
I got curves with no plan to lose 'em (Woo!)
'Cause I love who I am
So are you the man, the man who can handle my curves?
'Cause I got curves from my top to my bottom (Aye)
I got curves and I'm proud that I got 'em (Yeah)
'Cause I love who I am
So are you the man, the man who can handle my curves?

Yo (Can you handle 'em, handle 'em, handle my curves?)
I'm about to spit bars, and also knowledge (Can you handle 'em, handle my curves?)
Oh, so pay attention (So can you handle 'em, handle 'em, handle my curves? Baby can you handle my curves?)

Do you remember Marilyn Monroe had all that curvy love?
We put her ass up on the pedestal but now we just judge
And I ain't here to preach
I ain't really pissed
I'm looking for a man who can appreciate this
I got curves

I got curves and I know how to use 'em
I got curves with no plan to lose 'em
'Cause I love who I am
So are you the man, the man who can handle my curves?
'Cause I got curves from my top to my bottom
I got curves and I'm proud that I got 'em
'Cause I love who I am
So are you the man, the man who can handle my curves?

The man who can handle my curves (Can you handle 'em, handle 'em, handle my curves?)
I said the man who can handle my curves (Can you handle 'em, handle my curves?)
'Cause I love who I am, so are you the man, the man who can handle my curves?
(Can you handle 'em, handle 'em, handle my curves? The man who can handle my curves)
