Lyrics:


Oh ohh [x3]
Oh oh

Young love, close the chapter, there's no ever after
Fell fast, ended faster, yeah

Oh ohh

Late night conversations, led to complications
Now my heart is in my hands

Oh ohh

But you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames
And I just keep on asking myself

How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway

Oh ohh

Heartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway

Oh ohh

All your screaming whispers, slip right through my fingers
But these memories linger on

Oh ohh

Eyes closed, all I see is good times disappearing
And I'm trying to hold on

Oh ohh

Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames
I just keep on asking myself

How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway

Oh ohh

Heartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway

Oh ohh

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh... [x3]

Castaway

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh... [x3]

Castaway

How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway

How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway

Oh ohh

Heartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway

Oh ohh

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh... [x3]
Castaway, castaway

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh... [x3]
Castaway, castaway
