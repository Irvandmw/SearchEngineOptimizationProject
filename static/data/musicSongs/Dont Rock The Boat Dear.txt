Lyrics:


[MW] Don't rock the boat dear
[MW] Keep our love afloat dear
[MW] Strike that happy note dear
[MW] We're not lost at sea

[DM] Keep our love ready
[DM] And never high or heady
[DM] Always keep it steady
[DM] The way it ought to be

[Both] Even though we're out in deep water
[Both] We must save the future for sons and daughters
[MW] Don't rock the ship dear
[DM] Here's a little tip dear
[MW] Make each trip a pip dear
[Both] Just for the likes of you and me

[DM] Don't rock the yacht dear
[MW] Don't you go to pot dear
[DM] This year is a hot year
[DM] We're not lost at sea

[MW] Don't rock the scow now
[DM] Charm me off the bow now
[MW] Love me here and now
[Both] Wow the way it ought to be

[DM] Even though we're out in deep water
[MW] We must save the future for sons and daughters
[DM] Don't rock the sloop dear
[MW] Don't be nincompoop dear
[DM] Lovers loop the loop dear
[Both] It was made for us

[MW] Don't rock the craft dear
[DM] We're not on a raft dear
[MW] Love before and aft [Both] dear
[Both] Don't rock the boat dear
[DM] Keep our love afloat dear
[MW] Strike that happy note dear [Both] dear
[Both] Just for the likes of you and me
