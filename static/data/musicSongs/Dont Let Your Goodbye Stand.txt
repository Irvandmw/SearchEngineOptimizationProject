Lyrics:


If you're changing can't include me
It was a matter of time I fear
'Cause I hear most regularly
Like the turning of the year
The young men gettin' older
Grow sincere much to dry
I'll understand if I can't hold you
I won't share the tears I'll cry

Would you steal from a dyin' man
Love from an outstretched hand
Upsets no prior plan
Believe in me

Don't let your goodbye stand
Don't let your goodbye stand
Don't let your goodbye stand

You can have the better of me
It's your game and it's your rules
I'll concede to labels gladly
As your warm affection cools
Don't put me out to pasture
Mend your lyin' eyes to me
And it's true it just won't last
If borrowed time is what you need

Would you steal from a dyin' man
Love from an outstretched hand
Upsets no prior plan
Believe in me

Don't let your goodbye stand
Don't let your goodbye stand
Don't let your goodbye stand

Would you steal from a dyin' man
Love from an outstretched hand
Upsets no prior plan
Believe in me

Don't let your goodbye stand
Don't let your goodbye stand
Don't let your goodbye stand
