Lyrics:


Everything you got in my head
Had melted in my heart like butter on bread
And I, I'm so weak for you
What should I do?
I linger on every word you say
I meditate on them as I fall asleep
And I dream of me and you
It's all that I do

The size of my heart
Grew larger with you
The circles on these maps
The planes that I flew
Time isn't a problem
When you're already through
I could find someone closer
But they aren't you

Plates start to shatter and I start to weep
Cause baby you live so far away from me
And what, what should I do? Which road leads to you?
Calling your name and wondering if you
Can hear me with all the trains that pass through
But no, you're too far to hear my calls

The size of my heart
Grew larger with you
The circles on these maps
The planes that I flew
Time isn't a problem
When you're already through
I could find someone closer
But they aren't you

Please forgive me, you don't know how sorry I am
Never was one to play games but why don't you understand
This sadness, they say is a gift but they lied
Can't help but to feel its a curse in my eyes

The size of my heart
Grew larger with you
The circles on these maps
The planes that I flew
Time isn't a problem
When you're already through
I could find someone closer, boy
But my heart longs for you
