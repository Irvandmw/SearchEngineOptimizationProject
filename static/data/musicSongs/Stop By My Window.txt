Lyrics:


You can find the street I live on
Just take a walk on a sunny day
Pass a house where the window's shinin'
Listen well and you'll hear me say
Come on in

Stop by my window
Keep knockin' at my door
Stop by my window
And you'll here me say
It's a perfect day
So why don't you stay with me

You can find the love I'm feeling
It's for the girl who will walk my way
Here I am got a funny feeling
I can tell you'll be here today
And you will

Stop by my window
Keep knockin' at my door
Stop by my window
And you'll here me say
It's a perfect day
So why don't you stay with me

What a day for window shopping
You're the girl at my window stopping
I can tell, soon you'll be dropping around
And I can be found
If you'll just

Stop by my window
Keep knockin' at my door
Stop by my window
Keep knockin' at my door
Stop by my window
Keep knockin' at my door
