Lyrics:


If you're looking for a new love
Here I am
If you're searching for a true love
Well here I am
Oh I'll hold you day and night
No I'll never let you out of my sight
If you're looking for a true love
Here I am

Have you ever been lonely
Have you ever, ever felt real blue
Does your heart need that someone
Who is kind, faithful and true

If you're looking for that someone
Here I am
If you're searching for an only one
Well here I am
Oh I've never shared a true love
And I've never, ever had a real love
If you're looking for a good love
Here I am
Mmmm, here I am
