Lyrics:


You're quite a creature, you're one of a kind
You can't resist this temptation
But you're mistaken if you think I'm blind
Cause I can see that you're a waste of time

Don't you cry no crocodile tears
Cause I don't fool so easy
I know that lying look in your eyes
I've seen it for years in your crocodile tears
Hmm

You turn them on just to get your way
Huh, a tear for every occasion
Well turn about, surely be fair play
A little hurtin' in you would make my day

Don't you cry no crocodile tears
Cause I don't fool so easy, honey
I know that lying look in your eyes
I've seen it for years in your crocodile tears

I had a habit of forgiving you
But hearts and habits get broken, yeah
And now I've done a little weeping too
So you can cry a river babe, we'll still be through

Don't you cry no crocodile tears
Cause I don't fool so easy
I know that lying look in your eyes
I've seen it for years through your crocodile tears
Crocodile tears

Don't need those crocodile tears, baby
Don't want your crocodile tears
