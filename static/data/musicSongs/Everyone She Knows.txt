Lyrics:


Everyone she knows is getting married
All the girls who used to get around
Cut their hair up to their shoulders
Spend all their Sundays sober now

And everyone she knows is having babies
They got tired of fighting with the clock
And their mama's always asking
If she's ever gonna have one

She's bored with all the boys
And the men are too damn old
She's sick of summer love
But the winter's just too cold
She's a Marilyn in blue jeans
With a touch of Jackie O
She's stuck between 17
And everyone she knows
Everyone she knows

Everyone she knows is buying houses
Even though their husbands don't come home
Don't call their exes up to fix it
If they do, they don't admit it
No, no, no

Everyone she knows is getting healthy
She still smokes a couple when she drinks
But the bars are getting harder
They don't ever card her

She's bored with all the boys
The men are too damn old
She's sick of summer love
But the winter's just too cold
She's a Marilyn in blue jeans
With a touch of Jackie O
She's stuck between 17
And everyone she knows
Everyone she knows

She goes out on Saturday night
She comes home late, she don't have to fight
Then she thinks ain't got it all, but I got it alright
And for a minute she's glad that she ain't like
Everyone she knows

She's bored with all the boys
The men are too damn old
She's sick of summer love
But the winter's just too cold
She's a Marilyn in blue jeans
With a touch of Jackie O
She's stuck between 17
And everyone she knows
Everyone she knows
Everyone she knows
Everyone she knows
Everyone she knows
