Lyrics:


(We got London on the track)
Okay
(I'm in London, got my beat from London)

You know I ain't never have shit (Okay)
Now I'm somewhere in a meeting getting my ass kissed
By a white man, 'cause his daughter fuck with my adlibs
I done dropped dick in her friend, I'm like, "My bad sis"
That nigga act like he too good, even for a bad bitch

I'ma buy a Lambo 'fore this album hit the fans, bitch
Tell the valet park my shit at the front
I'ma hit the gas bitch
I just did five shows, three days
Came back with that bag bitch
Pockets holding 45K and a fo'-five, so I sag bitch
If a fat bitch know how to get some money I'll fuck a fat bitch
Got a show coming up in London and got London on the track bitch
I give a fan a high-five at the airport, she did a backflip
I just went platinum and I'm coming back like

I don't think that they know Baby
I don't think that they know Baby
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go

Who said they can fuck with Baby?
Who said they can fuck with Baby?
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go

Man, fuck Baby
That lil' nigga in there
She really selling pussy, she act like she selling swimwear
A couple thousand to ya name, act like a millionaire
But I don't knock your hustle
Get it out the mud, I been there
Man, I'm so tired of niggas talking about who broke
Like we ain't all come from the bottom
We came up, I give 'em hope
And way before a nigga signed and made a rhyme
I was providing for my side
I had em' low and they had 'em high
You shopped with me, you ain't gotta lie

Now a nigga legit, huh
Fifty-thousand just to walk through
And do my one-two on yo bitch, huh
And bougie hoes didn't wanna fuck with me
Now I got em' all on my dick now
Like Lil Baby, fo' pockets all full
The money can't fit now
Man, I pull up, niggas hollering

I don't think that they know Baby
I don't think that they know Baby
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go

Who said they can fuck with Baby?
Who said they can fuck with Baby?
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
There he go

You know I ain't never have shit (Okay)
Now I'm somewhere in a meeting getting my ass kissed
By a white man, 'cause his daughter fuck with my adlibs
I done dropped dick in her friend, I'm like, "My bad sis"
That nigga act like he too good, even for a bad bitch
