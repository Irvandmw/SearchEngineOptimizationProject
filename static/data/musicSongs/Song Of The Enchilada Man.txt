Lyrics:


[CM] Enchilada
I've got a guy
All over town with a song goes the enchilada man
Come gather round for the song of the enchilada man
And for a treat good eat there's nothing better than
Enchiladas so nice and hot
Enchiladas I got I got

(Enchiladas) So nice and hot
Enchiladas [CM] I got I got

[CM] ? enchilada gal
[CM] ? enchilada gal
[CM] Don't take a piece of the stuff I make like no one can
[CM] Enchiladas I got I got
How do you make 'em
[CM] First you take-a chili pepper then a little spice throw a little salt in
That's nice
[CM] Then a bit of tobasco and a ? and lots of hot mustard is good for you

[CM] A little chili pepper still like mad tickle and taste now
Not bad
[CM] Little bit of tobasco maybe a cold
Little gasoline-o [CM] Oh that's for the stove
[CM] Enchiladas so nice and hot
[CM] Enchiladas [JL] I got I got
[JL] My name is Don Fernand I'm the enchilada king
[JL] I'll have you all understand I'm really quite a thing
[JL] I make cheese if you please that is positively eh
[JL] And for a treat try the meat that is absolutely ugh
[JL] After you buy it and try it you'll say it's simply eh
[JL] Enchiladas I don't know
[JL] Enchiladas oh hello
[JL] Little boy without a peso
[JL] There's no reason for your sorrow
[JL] All you have to do is say so
[JL] Enchiladas so nice and hot
[JL] Enchiladas I got I got

Aim with your live and laughter
It's your happiness he's after
[DM&CM] If you are happy we are too
[JL] I'm with you
[JL] Enchilada [DM&CM] All over town with a song of the enchilada man
[JL] Enchilada [DM&CM] Come gather round for the song of the enchilada man
[JL] Enchilada [DM&CM] Nobody else in the world sings the way we can
[JL] Enchilada [DM&CM] So nice and hot
[JL] Enchilada [DM&CM] I got I got
[All] Enchilada enchilada enchilada
[All] We got we got
