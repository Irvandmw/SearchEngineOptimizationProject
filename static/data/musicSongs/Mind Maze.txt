Lyrics:


I'm losing all direction
Slipping into quicksand
I've shattered the illusion
Seen behind the curtain
I'm disenchanted

Dancing on a wire
Juggling desire
Every hit gets harder
When you're fighting without armour
I'm disheartened

Do I start over?
Rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

It's a mind maze
All these heart games
Caught in a cage
A complex catch
Am I a common folk?
Will I beat it all?
I'm gonna feed myself and get out of my own way

Used to be so sparkling
But now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me
Now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive

Will I find salvation?
Some kind of moderation
Spinning all these plates is
Gonna be a challenge
A delicate balance

So do I start over?
Rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

It's a mind maze
All these heart games
Caught in a cage
A complex catch
Am I a common folk?
Will I beat it all?
I'm gonna feed myself and get out of my own way

Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way

So I start over
Re-rediscover
I submit to your, your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
No
