Lyrics:


Sing to me, Mr. C., sing to me 
the song that I've been waiting to hear, 
just for me, Mr. C., just for me, 
and everybody else will disappear... 

Say it isn't so, say it isn't so 
everyone is sayin' you don't love me 
say it isn't so! 

Everywhere I go  
everyone I know  
whispers that you're growin' tired of me  
say it isn't so! 

People say that you  
found somebody new  
and it won't be long before you leave me  
say it isn't true! 

Say that everything is still OK  
that's all I want to know  
and what they're sayin' 
say it isn't so! 

[instrumental break]

...and it won't be long before you leave me  
say it isn't true! 

Say that everything is still OK  
that's all I want to know  
and what they're sayin' 
say it isn't so! 

Blue skies, smilin' at me 
Nothin' but blue skies do I see 
Blue birds singin' a song  
Nothin' but blue birds all day long! 

Never saw the sun shinin' so bright 
Never say things goin' so right 
Noticin' the days hurryin' by 
When you're in love, my, my how they fly! 

Blue days, all of them gone 
Nothin' but blue skies from now on! 

[instrumental break]

Never saw the sun shinin' so bright 
Never say things goin' so right 
Noticin' the days hurryin' by 
When you're in love, my, my how they fly! 

Blue days, all of them gone 
Nothin' but blue skies from now on! 

Maybe I should have saved  
those left-over dreams 
funny, but here's that rainy day! 

Here's that rainy day  
they told me about  
and I laughed at the thought  
that it might turn out this way!  

Where is that worn-out wish  
that I threw aside, 
after it brought my lover near?  

Funny how love becomes  
a cold rainy day  
funny, that rainy day is here!  

[instrumental break]

Funny how love becomes  
a cold rainy day  
funny...  
that rainy day is here!
