Lyrics:


You Turn Me On, You Turn Me On
You Turn Me On, You Turn Me On
You Turn Me On, You Turn Me On

Yes Most Be This Wine
Girl I Swear That I
I Feel That I Need To Tell You I Love You
Sex Is Seeing You Glans
And The Way You Dance
And The Way You Whisper To Me

Love You Know What I Want
I Don't Even Need To Try To High
The Way You Turn Me On

Oww Baila Baila SeÃ±orita
Oww Mueve Mueve Que Me Excita
Oww Baila Baila SeÃ±orita
Oww Mueve Mueve Que Me Excita

Been Around This World
Loved A Million Girls
None Of Them Have Moved Me Like You
The Rhythm In Your Frame
Makes Me Saying Your Name
Can You Hear Me

Love You Know What I Want
I Don't Even Need To Try To High
The Way You Turn Me On

Oww Baila Baila SeÃ±orita
Oww Mueve Mueve Que Me Excita
Oww Baila Baila SeÃ±orita
Oww Mueve Mueve Que Me Excita

And I Start Sweating Can't Help It
Suena La Alarma
Come To The Rescue Right Now
Baby You're Body's On Fire

Sweating Can't Help It
Suena La Alarma
There's No Saving We Know
Baby Your Body's On Fire

Oww Baila Baila SeÃ±orita
Oww Mueve Mueve Que Me Excita
Oww Baila Baila SeÃ±orita
Oww Mueve Mueve Que Me Excita

You Turn Me On (Oww Baila Baila SeÃ±orita)
You Turn Me On (Oww Mueve Mueve Que Me Excita)
You Turn Me On (Oww Baila Baila SeÃ±orita)
You Turn Me On (Oww Mueve Mueve Que Me Excita)
You Turn Me On
You Turn Me On
You Turn Me On
