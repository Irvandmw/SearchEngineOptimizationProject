Lyrics:


Someone is waiting,
Waiting to walk from the shadow of lonely,
In to the sun...
It takes a moment to happen,
Fortune may smile on you,
Only a moment,
And there is the one!

High on a hilltop or in the heart of town,
A touch of the dreamer, won't let you down,
If not tomorrow, then someday,

Somehow in time you'll discover that someone,
Waiting (waiting...)
Waiting, like me!

High on a hilltop or in the heart of town,
A touch of the dreamer, won't let you down,
If not tomorrow, then someday,
Somehow in time you'll discover that someone,
Waiting (waiting...)
Like me!
