Lyrics:


I just can't tell how much I love you
You know that I will tell you true
You're my baby, don't mean maybe
That's why I love you like I do

When you touch me, my hearts on fire
You kiss me and my lips are too
You're my baby, don't mean maybe
That's why I love you like I do

I never thought this would happen
Little girl, no not to me
But now you've set my heart tappin'
Everyone can plainly see

Now that we'll always be together
I'll never ever make you blue
You're my baby, don't mean maybe
That's why I love you like I do

I never thought this would happen
Little girl, no not to me
But now you've set my heart tappin'
Everyone can plainly see

When you touch me, my hearts on fire
You kiss me and my lips are too
You're my baby, don't mean maybe
That's why I love you like I do

You're my baby, don't mean maybe
That's why I love you like I do
You're my baby, I don't mean maybe
That's why I love you like I do
