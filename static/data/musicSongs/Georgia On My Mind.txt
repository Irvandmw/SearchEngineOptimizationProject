Song Name: Georgia On My Mind
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Georgia, woh Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
I said Georgia, woh Georgia, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear like moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, I said Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Woh yeah Georgia, I said Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
I said an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
