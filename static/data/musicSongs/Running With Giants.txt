Lyrics:


I can be stupid
But not outrageous 
I can be sickness
But not contagious
I can be empty
But I'm not nameless
It's the way that you love me
The way that you love me
I can be patient
But I'm not waiting
I can be shook up
But I'm not shaken
I can be angry
But I'm not jaded
It's the way that you love me
The way that you love me 

I am not alone here
I'm not on my own here
I am not alone here
I'm not on my own (cause I am)

Running with giants
Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance 
So I can just let go
I've been running with giants
Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go

I can be outraged
But not a traitor
I can be distant
But I'm no stranger
I am a target but without danger
It's the way that you love me
The way that you love me
I can be strong
But not without weakness
I can be helpless
But not defeated
I can be cut deep
But I'm not bleeding
It's the way that you love me
The way that you love me

I am not alone here
I'm not on my own here
I am not alone
I'm not in my own (cause I am)

Running with giants
Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go
I've been running with giants
Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go

And I feel the pressure of ten men
When the floor cracks and the walls start moving in
I feel the strength that's from within
Kickin' down the doors and walls
We're coming in

And I feel the pressure of ten men
When the floor cracks and the walls start moving in
I feel the strength that's from within
Kickin' down the doors and walls
We're coming in

Running with giants
Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance 
So I can just let go
I've been running with giants
Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance 
So I can just let go
