Lyrics:


[Dua Lipa:]
Feel your eyes,
They all over me
Don't be shy,
Take control of me
Get the vibe
It's gonna be lit tonight

[Sean Paul:]
Baby girl, you a carry ten ton a phatness,
Gimme some of that
Mixed with the badness,
Look how she hot
Shaped like goddess, but a not just that,
It's a good piece of mentals under the cap

Hot piece of frame and mi love how you trod
Watching every step of the pepper the way you got
Stayin' in my brain, memory cyah detach
Mainly my aim is to give you this love

Hypnotic the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie, baby, you
Beam me up like Scotty, baby girl
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie, baby, you
Move so hypnotic

[Dua Lipa & Sean Paul:]
No lie
Girl, we never miss
Feel your eyes,
They're all over me
Don't be shy,
Take control of me
Get the vibe
It's gonna be lit tonight
Girl, we never miss, girl, we never miss
No lie

Hypnotized,
Pull another one
It's alright,
I know what you want
Get the vibe
It's gonna be lit tonight
Girl, we never miss, girl, we never miss
No lie

Feels how we do it
No lie
It's always how we do it
No lie
Feels how we do it
It's gonna be lit tonight
No lie

Feels how we do it
No lie
It's always how we do it
No lie
Feels how we do it
It's gonna be lit tonight
No lie

[Sean Paul:]
I'm so lit, so lit, my girl
So let me see you roll it, roll it, my girl
Me love it when you bend and fold it
Now let me bone it
And let me own it, my girl
Give you all the style that I have mastered
Hoist you up, baby girl, that's my word
Give you the good lovin' that is preferred
You deserve it, so don't be scared

It's hypnotic the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie, baby, you
Beam me up like Scotty, baby girl
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie, baby, you
Move so hypnotic

[Dua Lipa & Sean Paul:]
No lie
Girl, never miss
Feel your eyes,
They're all over me
Don't be shy,
Take control of me
Get the vibe
It's gonna be lit tonight
Girl, we never miss, girl, we never miss
No lie

Hypnotized,
Pull another one
It's alright,
