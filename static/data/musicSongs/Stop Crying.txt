Lyrics:


They say they do it, like I do it with no mask on
Nigga, get the fuck outta line, you getting blast on
Jesus let the weak roam the Earth without a purpose.
Iâll stomp ya fucking head til itâs under the surface
Now I need you to get it through ya bloodclot head
âFore I put a bullet through ya bloodclot dreads
These niggas ain't made of the same shit Iâm made of
I Double click for my man if he needs a favour
I let a nigga slide he came back and almost shot me
And he was thinking I was scared, nah nigga not me
You donât understand I was raised by the vultures
Still laughing like hyenas in the crib full of roaches
Call grandmami mommy cause mommy already dead
Daddy been missinâ since I was a little kid
Now who dared go there playinâ games with the orphan
They know my pedigree test me Iâmma off âem

[Hook (x2)]
Stop the bloodclot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Donât cry, dry ya eyes
Donât cry, dry ya eyes

That first body drop, we just getting started, death come in threeâs
Ar15, M16, semi-automatic, murder machine
Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade enter flesh itâs an emergency
Ya love leak, heart open call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the alter
See, Iâm at an advantage I donât care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontinâ when then patience start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds know, now Iâm half crazy
What is that a tear I see forming in ya eye
Why are you so frightened weâre all gonna die
You can say a prayer when Iâm coming like the reaper
Staring through that sight on the top of my heater

[Hook]
