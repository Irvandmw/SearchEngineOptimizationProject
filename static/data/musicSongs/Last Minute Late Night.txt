Lyrics:


I know it's late to be callin', whatcha doin' right now?
I couldn't wait, til tomorrow, to get to takin you out.
I gotta see you girl ASAP, I gotta get you right here next to me.
Getcha right here next to me.

On a last minute, late night, date night, me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn.
Little midnight, kissin and red wine sippin, and listenin to the crickets singin love songs.
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes, hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong. 
On a last minute, late night, date night, me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Oh girl come on. Come on, come on.

I'm on my way, in a hurry, I'll be there in five.
It's ok, don't you worry, I know your lookin so fine.
In that bulldog t-shirt, hair pulled back. 
You know I love it when you lookin like that.
You know I love it when you lookin like that.

On a last minute, late night, date night, me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn.
Little midnight, kissin and red wine sippin, and listenin to the crickets singin love songs.
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes, hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong. 
On a last minute, late night, date night, me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Oh girl come on. Come on, come on.

Girl, I, know, this, might sound crazy, but, I, can't, help, it, when I'm crazy for you baby, ain't playin when I'm sayin

We're having a last minute, late night, date night, me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn.
Little midnight, kissin and red wine sippin, and listenin to the crickets singin love songs.
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes, hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong. 
On a last minute, late night, date night, me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Oh girl come on. Come on, come on.
Oh girl come on.
Oh girl come on.
On a last minute, late night, date night, me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn.
