Lyrics:


Today when I awoke
The morning blues hung over me
So, I looked it straight in the eye
I jumped into the shower
For 'bout an hour
Aw it was fine
Yeah, it helps me all the time
It's soothing to my mind
Just to see those blues
Go slipping down the drain
Now I usually have my breakfast
Which consists of tasty spam
Yeah, I could eat it all day long
But I only love one brand
And I can't find it way out here
So, I have to take a pass
And settle for some hash
What a drag and you're not here
Oh, sweet sweet spam
