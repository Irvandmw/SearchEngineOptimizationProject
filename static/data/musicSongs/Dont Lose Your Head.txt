Lyrics:


Don't lose your head.
Don't lose your head.
Don't lose your head.
(Don't lose your head.)
No, don't lose your head.
(Don't lose your head.)

Hear what I say:
Don't lose your way.

Remember: love's stronger.
Remember: love walks tall.

Don't lose your heart.
(Don't lose your heart.)
No, don't lose your heart.
(Don't lose your heart.)

(Hear what I say:)
Hear what I say:
(Don't lose your way.)
Don't lose your way.

Remember: love's stronger.
Remember: love walks through walls.

Don't drink and drive a car.
Don't get breathalysed.
Don't lose your head.

If you make it to the top
And you wanna stay alive,
Don't lose your head.

Don't lose your head.

Don't lose your head.
(Don't lose your head.)
No, don't lose your head.
(Don't lose your head.)

(Hear what I say:)
Hear what I say:
(Don't lose your way. Hey!)
Don't lose your way.

Remember: love's stronger.
Remember: love conquers all.

Don't lose your head.
Don't lose your head.

Don't lose your head.
Don't lose your head.
Don't lose your head.

Don't lose your head.

Don't lose your head.
Don't lose your head.
Don't lose your head.
[Repeat until fade out]
