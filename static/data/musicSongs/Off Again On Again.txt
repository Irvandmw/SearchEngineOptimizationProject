Lyrics:


(Off again on again off again on again)
Off again on again it's here and then it's gone again
Oh this is some romance
In again out again it's with and then without again
Let's give it half a chance
It's cold and then hot again you're mine and then you're not again
You're always playing peek-a-boo
I'm in a stew about blue about what am I going to do about
Off again on again you

(Off again on again it's here and then it's gone again)
(Oh this is some romance)
(In again out again it's with and then without again)
(Let's give it half a chance)
It's cold and then hot again you're mine and then you're not again
You're always playing peek-a-boo (peek-a-boo)
I'm in a stew about blue about what am I going to do about
Off again on again you
(Off again on again you)
Off again on again you
