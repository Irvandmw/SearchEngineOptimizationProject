Lyrics:


Please don't cry my love
Goodbye

I want to stay but now it's time so
Please don't cry my love

Please don't stand that way
Please don't stand...
'Cause you know that it's hard when you look that way
Know that it's hard when you talk that way so
Please don't say...

Please don't cry my love...

'Cause you know that it's hard when you look that way
Know that it's hard when you talk that way

Please don't say goodbye
Please don't say goodbye

Goodbye.
