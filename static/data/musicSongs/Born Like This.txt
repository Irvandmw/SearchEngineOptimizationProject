Lyrics:


Itâs not what I took from you
Itâs not what I stole
We are born like this
Like this

The time has come to change this
To stretch the thought a mile
Weâve lost that kind of spirit

We want it back today
The time is right to change this
To make the life we know
They took what we were given
Weâll get it back again

Somewhere someoneâs gun, someoneâs gun is laughing
Itâs not what I gave to you
Itâs now what I sold
We are born like this
(Like this)
Itâs not what I took from you
Itâs not what I stole
We are born like this

You try your best to mock me
Youâre always in my way
Youâve lost what youâve been given
Youâll get it back today

The time is right to change this
To make the life we know
They took what we were given
We want it back again

Somewhere someoneâs gun, someoneâs gun is laughing
Itâs not what I gave to you
Itâs now what I sold
We are born like this
Itâs not what I took from you
Itâs not what I stole
We are born like this

Somewhere youâre floating high
Youâre not living
We are

Somewhere someoneâs gun, someoneâs gun is laughing, laughing
Itâs not what I gave to you
Itâs now what I sold
We are born like this
(Like this)
Itâs not what I gave to you
Itâs not what I stole
We are born like this
(Like this)

Itâs not what I took from you
Itâs not what I stole
We are born like this
