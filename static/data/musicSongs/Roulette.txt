Lyrics:


I'm uptight
Playing by the rules in this game of life
365 days on the grind
Something's stirring, I might need to unwind
Then, there's you
Texting me a little bubble of trouble
I've tried to ignore these thoughts that rumble
I think I'm bored of being so careful

Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down, have a few rounds and
Just let go

Like roulette, oh oh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, oh oh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette
Let's roll it

They say everything in moderation
And sometimes you got to give in to temptation
So I drop a pin to my location
Let's roll the dice

Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down, have a few rounds and
Just let go

Like roulette, oh oh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, oh oh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette
Let's roll it
Like roulette
(Let's roll it)

So tonight we test limits
Take the safety off for a minute
'Cause my love's a bullet with your name written on it
Just load it and spin it

Like roulette, oh oh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, oh oh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette
Let's roll it
Like roulette
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
(Like roulette)
