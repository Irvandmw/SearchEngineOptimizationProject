Lyrics:


It's ok to fear
It's ok when you feel small
You're ok right here
It's ok when you feel nothing at all

It's ok to find out
What you though you had ain't what you got
It's ok to doubt
To learn what you think ain't what you thought

We are always in motion
Like the winds, the tides, the ocean
Everyday I'm born again
I wake up I feel that second wind

We're gonna be alright
I've seen the look in your eye
We're gonna be alright
Just take a look at the sky
We're gonna be alright

It's OK to grieve
It's OK to learn to fall
It's OK to believe
To admit that you're human after all

It's ok to heal
All of those scars buried deep inside
It's OK to feel
To say all the things you've been trying to hide

Lift it up to the ceiling
Cause we all need that healing
Let's get lost in the feeling, the feeling
The feeling

We're gonna be alright
