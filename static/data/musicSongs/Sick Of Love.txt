Lyrics:


Take me out
Take me someplace broken people go
Nice and dark
You should know, you should know
I'm impatient
Got no expectations
Emotionally vacant
Let's go, let's just go

Love was something I used to believe in
I've been burned too many times before
Hope is fading, my heart needs replacing
It can't feel a thing anymore

I'm so sick of love
(Love! La-la-la-la-la)
So sick of love
(Love! La-la-la-la-la)
So sick of love
(Love! La-la-la-la-la)
So sick of love
So sick of love
I'm so sick of love

Let's keep driving
Let's keep neverminding the world
We can hide
Just stay low, just stay low
Salty lashes
Behind these sunglasses
There's no coming back
Once we go, once we go

Love was something I used to believe in
I've been burned too many times before
Hope is fading, my heart needs replacing
It can't feel a thing anymore

I'm so sick of love
(Love! La-la-la-la-la)
So sick of love
(Love! La-la-la-la-la)
So sick of love
(Love! La-la-la-la-la)
So sick of love
So sick of love
I'm so sick of love

I'm so sick of love

Take it step by step
Take it day by day
Take it line by line
Push it all away

I'mma drink this drink
Till I lose my mind
Every girl I know
Leave 'em all behind

Love was something I used to believe in
I've been burned too many times before
Hope is fading, my heart needs replacing
It can't feel a thing anymore

I'm so sick of love
(Love! La-la-la-la-la)
So sick of love
(Love! La-la-la-la-la)
So sick of love
(Love! La-la-la-la-la)
So sick of love
So sick of love
(Hey!)

I'm so sick of love
I'm so sick of love
I'm so sick of love
