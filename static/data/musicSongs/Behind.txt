Lyrics:


Why can't you see?
What you do to me?
And why I can't let you go.
But if you feel
The same as me
Then, just let me know.

But if you don't come
You'll never see
That you're part of me.

And if you don't mind.
You can leave me behind,
I'll be back again, eventually.

Why cant you see?
What you do to me
That I can't let you go

But if you feel
The same as me
Then, just let me know.

But if you don't come
You'll never see
That you're part of me.

And if you don't mind.
You can leave me behind,
I'll be back again, eventually.

But if you don't come
You'll never see
That you're part of me.

And if you don't mind.
You can leave me behind,
I'll be back again, eventually.
