Lyrics:


I don't need my stocking filled with toys
And I don't need no gifts to bring me joy
Baby, I haven't hung my mistletoe
'Cause without you, baby, I can't see no point

Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me
'Cause it's all I wished for this Christmas Eve
No, I don't want much, your love is all I need
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me

Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year
Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year

I don't wanna light this tree alone
I can't sing Christmas songs if you're not home
No, I haven't hung my mistletoe
'Cause without you, baby, I can't see no point

Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me
'Cause it's all I wished for this Christmas Eve
No, I don't want much, your love is all I need
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me

Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year

It's been so cold since you've been gone
This winter seems so long
And I can't get in no spirit
It feels so wrong

Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year
Hope he bringing me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year

Hope he bringing me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year
Hope he bringing me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year

Hey
(Love this Christmas)
Would you bring me love
(Deserve you here)
(Love this Christmas)
(Good this year)
(Love this Christmas)
(Deserve you here)
It's the only thing I need
(Love this Christmas)
(Good this year)
