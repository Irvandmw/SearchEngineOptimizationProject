Lyrics:


One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got on love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one

For God so loved the world he gave us a good Crip
The late, great Neighborhood Nip
Dippin' in this L.A. bullshit, 'bout as solid of youngsta as a nigga could get (Yup)
Was nothin' like these thug phonies
Was always showin' love and big respect for all the Blood homies (Whuttup!)
You understood the values in the youth
Man, I swear to God, nephew, you was the truth
Damn, how could this nigga do this?
It's 'cause every neighborhood Jesus, got a neighborhood Judas
Who hate to see your team ridin' rich
You see that envy and that pride
That's that green eyed bitch
Worse than a woman scorned (Damn)
It'd be better for that man if he had never been born
But Mary, don't you mourn, Martha, don't you weep
You see, your son still affected us deep
Give us the faith to take that leap

One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got one
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got on love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one

All it take is one, one, one brave Blood and one brave Crip
Standing up together like we did back on them slave ships
Out on high sea waves, fighting other whips
Steady hearing "Jesus saves" out of devils lips
Shackled at the hips for the color of our skin
Hundreds of us, yeah, we knew we was brothers then
But here we go again, underneath the gun
They got us thinkin' we all different when we (One)
So I'm givin' thanks to the gangstas, givin' praise to the neighbors
Damus and Pirus, y'all got the whole world amazed
Special shout out to the Hoovers for showin us how it's done
Ain't nothin' greater when we unite as (One)
Ain't got no ulterior motives and no other agendas
Fakin' like you with us just like some puppet pretenders, we ready to end this
For every eye that still cries
It's time to realize God will rise when we tie us

One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got one
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got on love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got one

One Blood, one Cuzz, yeah
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you have one, one, one
One Blood, one Cuzz
Motherhood, brotherhood, ain't no other hood, just imagine if we all was one hood
Now put them all together, you got one
