Lyrics:


Well I believe in love, but not the kinda screws you up, no!

I believe in time and chance
Cause Iâm not one for making plans
Well youâll go down in history
And thatâs just what it is to me
I believe in moving on
When sentimental and love is gone

But if Iâm crying over you
I wonât lie even itâs hard to do
When you turn around
Iâll be gone and I mean goodbye

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I donât know where Iâm going but when you turn around Iâll be gone and that means goodbye

I believe in love but not the kinda breaks you up, no!
I donât regret the day I felt
Kiss the life, I wish you well

But if Iâm crying over you
I wonât lie even itâs hard to do
When you turn around
Iâll be gone and I mean goodbye

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I donât know where Iâm going but when you turn around Iâll be gone and I mean goodbye.

Well I know youâre full, full of good intentions yeah
But that donât change a thing cause Iâm already out of here
Oh, oh, oh
When you turn around Iâll be gone and I mean goodbye

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I donât know where Iâm going but when you turn around Iâll be gone and I mean goodbye
I see you in another life

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I donât know where Iâm going but when you turn around Iâll be gone and I mean goodbye

I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I donât know where Iâm going but when you turn around Iâll be gone and I mean goodbye
