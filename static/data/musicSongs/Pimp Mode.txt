Chamillionaire

Yeah
Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go
Chamillitary-man yeaah 
Pimp Mode, You know I stay in Pimp Mode
You know I stay in Pimp Mode yea
Let her go (she wanna leave)
Let her go (then you gotta let her breathe baby)
Let her go (But if you wanna stay make sure you wipe your feet off on the floor before you
step through the door) (Chamillitary-Man)

[Chorus]
Let me hop right into Pimp Mode
Got the top down on a fresh set of those fo's
And I push it real slow, slow, slow
I pimp the Caddy real slow, real slow, real slow
Let me hop right into Pimp Mode
Put the game on them, you know how the rest go, You know how the rest go, go, go
You know I be in Pimp Mode, Pimp Mode, Pimp Mode

Picture me listenin' while she beggin' (beggin')
That ain't even my style (style), thats a penalty or a foul (foul)
Hit the sideline and sit down (down)
I ain't even trippin' bout how many my numbers that she gon dial (dial)
You'll get ejected from the game now (now)
Watch reality hit ya like pow (pow)
You know my stacks will stay stackin'
Knowin' they hate so I'ma stay packin'
Knowin' Chamillionaire got what they lackin'
havin' them ladys showin they back in
Continental Lincoln just stretchin'
Stash is hidin' my weapon
Baby flashin' her fleshin'
Hopin' its her that im sexin'
Yes, I'm stayin' fresh just like Mannie
'Bout to go hit my spot in Miami
Now that i won I'm puttin' my Grammy
On the grill and hood of my Candy
She talkin' bout can we, can we what?
Please take another vacation?
And I'm like take another vacation
You gonna have to sit and stay patient
I control her and remote her
She doin' just what I told her
Got her phone book in my phone yea
somewhere up in my folder
I stay choosin' em like a voter
I Told her I'll promote her
Pinky shinin' like its solar
Game colder than a polar (hold up)

[Chorus]
Let me hop right into Pimp Mode
Got the top down on a fresh set of those fo's
And I push it real slow, slow, slow
I pimp the Caddy real slow, real slow, real slow
Let me hop right into Pimp Mode
Put the game on them, you know how the rest go, You know how the rest go, go, go
You know I be in Pimp Mode, Pimp Mode, Pimp Mode

[Bun B]
Well it's a sunny day in the city
With syrup and Sunny D
Flippin' through Sunny Side
Tryin' to get me some money g
Down South on the South Side
Where car seats are super-soft
If you Trill we can conversate
If you ain't I'll blow ya off
Bun B, the King of the Trill
The one and the only mayne
My roof linin' is swede
My seats is pony mayne
My air-forces is crocodile
Candy and Do Do mayne
So when i step out
I'm steppin out fly
Thats fa'sho tho mayne
Now Cadillac cars
The machine 26's
Sittin' clean, cup full of promethazine for the lean, naw mean (naw mean)
Sittin taller than Yao-Ming
Cut the corner, them hatas
fall back and start bawing
Lookin regal in the Regal
Presidential in the Lincoln
A Balla in the Beama
Man what the fuck was you thinkin'?
Me and Koopa wouldn't shine
We got u boys sweatin'
Playa, Texas is a grind-house
Ask Robert and Quentin we be pimpin

[Chorus]
Let me hop right into Pimp Mode
Got the top down on a fresh set of those fo's
And I push it real slow, slow, slow
I pimp the Caddy real slow, real slow, real slow
Let me hop right into Pimp Mode
Put the game on them, you know how the rest go, You know how the rest go, go, go
You know I be in Pimp Mode, Pimp Mode, Pimp Mode
Pimp Mode, 

Mmm You in the presence of a playa
In the presence of a playa (yea)
Mmm I aint gonna be the one to save ya
I ain't gonna be the one to save ya
Mmm you in the presence of a playa
In the presence of a playa
Mmm I aint gonna be the one to save ya
I ain't gonna be the one to save ya

Let me hop right into Pimp Mode
Got the top down on a fresh set of those fo's
And I push it real slow, slow, slow
I pimp the Caddy real slow, real slow, real slow
Let me hop right into Pimp Mode
Put the game on them, you know how the rest go, You know how the rest go, go, go
You know I be in Pimp Mode, Pimp Mode, Pimp Mode
