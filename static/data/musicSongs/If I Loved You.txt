Lyrics:


If I loved you 
Time and again I would try to say  
All I'd want you to know! 

If I loved you 
Words wouldn't come in an easy way 
'Round in circles I'd go!  

Longing to tell you  
But afraid an' shy  
I'd let my golden chances pass me by! 

Soon you'd leave me 
Off you would go in the mist of day 
Never, never to know  
How I love you  
If I loved you! 

[instrumental break]

[repeat last verse]
