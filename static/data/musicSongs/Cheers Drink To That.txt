Lyrics:


One, two.
We're taking shots in here. You want one?

Cheers to the freakin' weekend
I drink to that.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh let the Jameson sink in.
I drink to that.
Yeah, yeah.

Don't let the bastards get you down.
Turn it around with another round.
There's a party at the bar.
Everybody put your glasses up.
And I drink to that.

I drink to that.

Life's too short to be sittin' round miserable.
People gon' talk whether you doing bad or good.
Yeah.
Got a drink on my mind and my mind on my money.
Yeah.
Looking so bomb, gonna find me a honey.

Got my Ray-Bans on,
And I'm feelin' hella cool tonight.
Yeah.
Everybody's vibing.
So, don't nobody start a fight.
Yeah.

Cheers to the freakin' weekend.
I drink to that.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, let the Jameson sink in.
I drink to that.
Yeah, yeah.

Don't let the bastards get you down.
Turn it around with another round.
There's a party at the bar.
Everybody put your glasses up.
And I drink to that.

I drink to that.

'Bout to hop on the bar.
Put it all on my card tonight.
Yeah.
Might be mad in the morning,
But you know we goin' hard tonight.

It's getting Coyote Ugly up in here.
No Tyra.
It's only up from here.
No downward spiral.

Got my Ray-Bans on,
And I'm feelin' hella cool tonight.
Yeah.
Everybody's vibing.
So, don't nobody start a fight.
Yeah.

Cheers to the freakin' weekend.
I drink to that.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh let the Jameson sink in.
I drink to that.
Yeah, yeah.

Don't let the bastards get you down.
Turn it around with another round.
There's a party at the bar.
Everybody put your glasses up.
And I drink to that.

I drink to that.
And I drink to that.
I drink to that.

Cheers to the freakin' weekend.
I drink to that.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, let the Jameson sink in.
I drink to that.
Yeah, yeah.

Don't let the bastards get you down.
Turn it around with another round.
There's a party at the bar.
Everybody put your glasses up.
And I drink to that

I drink to that.
And I drink to that.
I drink to that.
And I drink to that.
