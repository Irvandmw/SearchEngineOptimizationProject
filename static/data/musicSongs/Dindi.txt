Lyrics:


Sky, so vast as the sky  
with far away clouds just wandering by... 
Where did they go?  
Oh I don't know, don't know... 

Wind, that speaks to the leaves 
telling stories that no one believes... 
Stories of love  
belong to you and me... 

Oh Dindi... 
If I only had words 
I would say all the beautiful things that I see 
when you're with me  
Oh my Dindi! 

Oh Dindi... 
Like the song of the wind in the trees 
that's how my heart is singing Dindi, happy Dindi, 
when you're with me! 

I love you more each day,  
yes I do, yes I do... 
I'd let you go away 
If you take me with you! 

Don't you know Dindi... 
I'd be running an' searching for you, 
like a river, that can't find the sea, 
that would be me, without you my Dindi!  

[instrumental break]

Don't you know Dindi... 
I'd be running an' searching for you, 
like a river, that can't find the sea, 
that would be me, without you my Dindi!
