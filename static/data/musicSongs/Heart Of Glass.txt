Lyrics:


Couldn't breathe
Couldn't breathe it was high tide
Couldn't leave couldn't leave
Felt the night sky closing in
Closing in on me
Couldn't scream couldn't dream
Only nightmares
Pity me couldn't see
For the darkness closing in
Closing in

You said
See a need, fill the need
See a need, fill the need
You said
See a need, fill the need
See a need, fill the need

Up til now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I been living in a heart of glass

Until now
Iwas living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass

Keep me safe in your loving embracing arms
Kiss your face still there's no more to say
I'll hold you near, I'll hold you near to me

You said
See a need, fill the need
See a need, fill the need
You said see a need, fill the need
You said see a need, fill the need

Up til now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I been living in a heart of glass

Until now
Iwas living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass

Oh you took a chance on me
Risk and your hands may bleed
Risk and your hands may bleed

Oh you took a chance on me
Risk and your hands may bleed
Risk and your hands may bleed

Up til now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I been living in a heart of glass

Up til now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass

Up til now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I been living in a heart of glass

Up til now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I been living in a heart of glass
