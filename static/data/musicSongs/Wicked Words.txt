Lyrics:


I don't, no no
You don't know me very well, at all
Yet you float, on every heavy word you wrote
Yes it seems I must have missed the boat

And I could care just a little bit less
But there's still a heart beating in my chest
And I, but I, try to keep that a secret

Now cast away your wicked words
I don't wanna hear you sigh no more
Not interested in those grudges that you keep
Now your story may be hard
Oh, there's a lesson to be learned by you
Talk ain't worth a lot when it's so cheap

And I cope knowing that you won't
Get the best of me with your wicked soul
I hope you choke on every heavy word you spoke
Till you find it, find it hard to float

And I could care just a little bit less
But there's still a heart beating in my chest
And I, but I, try to keep that a secret

Now cast away your wicked words
I don't wanna hear you sigh no more
Not interested in those grudges that you keep
Now your story may be hard
Oh, there's a lesson to be learned by you
Talk ain't worth a lot when it's so cheap

It's been so long, really think it's time to move on
When your vision is doubling and all you are troubling is me
When you get so stale, all I do is raise my sets
And you look through the haze, you can find me on my way

Cast away your wicked words
I don't wanna hear you sigh no more
Not interested in those grudges that you keep
Now your story may be hard
Oh, there's a lesson to be learned by you
Talk ain't worth a lot when it's so cheap

Cast away, cast away, cast away your wicked words
I don't wanna hear them, no

(Cast away, cast away, cast away your wicked words
I don't wanna hear them, no)
