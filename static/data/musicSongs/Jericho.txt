Lyrics:


Hop on a fast train out of town
Downside up and Upside down
Going fast is going slow
What could have been we'll never know
In this place that has no name
I can't remember why I came
Then I hear you whisper low
One more mile to Jericho
Nothing is ever what it seems
When you live inside your dreams

[Chorus:]
The walls will tumble
the walls will tumble
But Im not gonna cry
My heart wont crumble
My heart wont crumble
If we ever say goodbye

Everybody gets the joke
Where's the fire?
Where's the smoke?
Money, love and jealousy
Something's got a hold on me
But I will follow where you go
One more mile to Jericho

[Repeat Chorus]

One more mile
One more kiss
One more word
One more wish
And love will save us
This I know
From this place called Jericho

[Repeat Chorus x2]

If we ever say goodbye [x5]
