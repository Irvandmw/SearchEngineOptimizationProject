Lyrics:


Something is coming
My blood is pumping
Pure inspiration
Fueled in my imagination

My brain keeps going
Genius overflowing

Let's make it bigger
I'll make it jump higher
I'll make it run faster, stronger
Going on forever

Let's make it bigger
(Better, faster, stronger)
Hey, hey
Let's make it bigger
(Better, faster, stronger)
Hey, hey

Something is pushing
The limits are fading
All new creation
Reaching top acceleration

My brain keeps going
Genius overflowing

Let's make it bigger
I'll make it jump higher
I'll make it run faster, stronger
Going on forever

Let's make it bigger
(Better, faster, stronger)
Hey, hey
Let's make it bigger
(Better, faster, stronger)
Hey, hey

My brain keeps going
Genius overflowing
The walls keep falling
Dreams ever expanding

Let's make it bigger
Let's make it bigger

Let's make it bigger
I'll make it jump higher
I'll make it run faster, stronger
Going on forever

Let's make it bigger
(Better, faster, stronger)
Hey, hey
Let's make it bigger
(Better, faster, stronger)
Hey, hey
