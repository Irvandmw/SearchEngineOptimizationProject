Lyrics:


So I, walked into your life,
But no I didn't make up your mind
No I left you your space
And I gave you your time,
I left you with yours
But then you left with mine,

That's all in the past, I'm comin' back
Baby I'm strong, I ain't lookin' back,
Oh what to do
With a good one like you,
No I can't decide

Your games, your games that you play
Got me runnin', runnin' away
I can't, no I can't erase
Everything we made, so I'm a say

Keep your head in the sky
You go, go high
What ever you do,
Do it tonight
Like a bird flyin' high,
Stay up in the sky
Hold on to yourself
Don't fall tonight,
Tonight, tonight
No don't fall tonight,
Tonight, tonight,
No don't fall tonight

Now I, I'm out of your life
And no I wont come back tonight
Cause everything that we said
It runs through my head
This time I'll try to forget, I promise

Your games, your games that you play
Got me runnin', runnin' away
I can't, no I can't erase
Everything we made, so I'm a say

Keep your head in the sky
Go, go high
What ever you do,
Do it tonight
Like a bird flyin' high,
Stay up in the sky
Hold on to yourself
Don't fall tonight,
Tonight, tonight,
No don't fall tonight,
Tonight, tonight,
No don't fall tonight

Keep your head in the sky
You go, go high
Keep your head in the sky
You go, go high
Keep your head in the sky
You go, go high
Keep your head in the sky
You go, go high

What ever you do,
Do it tonight
Like a bird flyin' high,
Stay up in the sky
Hold on to yourself
Don't fall tonight,
Tonight, tonight,
No don't fall tonight,
Tonight, tonight,
No don't fall tonight
