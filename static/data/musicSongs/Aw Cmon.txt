Lyrics:


I wanna kiss kiss kiss
But you don't want to, but you don't want to
A kiss should be such bliss
But you don't want to but you don't want to

My lips are just the place to place your lips upon
Go on
Aw c'mon, aw c'mon, aw c'mon

I wanna hug hug hug
But you don't want to, but you don't want to
A hug could be oh so snug
But you don't want to, but you don't want to
You'll gonna change your mind some day
But I'll be gone gone gone
Aw c'mon, aw c'mon, aw c'mon

But you don't want to, but you don't want to
But you don't want to, but you don't want to

You'll gonna change your mind some day
But I'll be gone gone gone
Aw c'mon, aw c'mon, aw c'mon
