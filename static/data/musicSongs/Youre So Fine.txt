Lyrics:


Well you're so fine, got you on my mind
That's a real good sign, be my steady date

Well baby I sit with you, I don't know what to do
Would you dance, make romance, if I asked you to
Why don't you be mine, love me all the time
Baby don't say why, 'cause I'm a little bit shy

I think of you no matter where I'm at
School or at the drugstore where we met
The day I carved your name upon my desk
And told all the fellas that like you to
That you're the girl that I love best

Well I won't forget this night, the kiss that held me tight
I took my chance, made romance, everything turned out right
'Cause you're so fine, got you on my mind
That's a real good sign, don't hesitate, be my steady date

I think of you no matter where I'm at
School or at the drugstore where we met
The day I carved your name upon my desk
And told all the fellas that like you to
That you're the girl that I love best

Well I won't forget this night, the kiss that held me tight
I took my chance, made romance, everything turned out right
'Cause you're so fine, got you on my mind
That's a real good sign, don't hesitate, be my steady date
