Lyrics:


I was lost in the wild side of life
I was blinded by smoke and neon lights
I was drinkin' and sinkin'
Without a prayer
Then she showed up
Right out of thin air 

She took me to heaven
Oh my Lord, what a ride
And I've never been higher
On her love I could fly
I was hell bound
On my way down
Then I found what I need
Oh, an angel loved the devil out of me 

I thank God for her love each day
He saved me
When he sent her my way
Now each night
I drive by those neon lights
And go home to my own paradise 

Where she takes me to heaven
Oh my Lord, what a ride
and I've never been higher
On her love I could fly
I was hell bound
On my way down
Then I found what I need
Oh, an angel loved the devil out of me 

Oh yes she did
An angel loved the devil out of me
