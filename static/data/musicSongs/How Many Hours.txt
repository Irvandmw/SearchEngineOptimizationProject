Lyrics:


Mothers giving birth to a little son
Crying in the rain of falling bombs
Father he is young but deep and wise
You see the fighter inside his eyes 

Hold me cover my sight
This is no paradise
Don't show me the
Evil sides of the world 

[Chorus:]
How many hours and how many days
Love is just slipping away
How many seasons and how many years
In tears
How many centuries and how many lives
In fear 

People selling flowers like nothing's going on
Turning their backs on a world gone wrong
Children play around I guess they found some wheels
You see them running down the naked fields
Hold me cover my sight
This is no paradise
Don't show me the
Evil sides of the world 

[Chorus (2X):]
How many hours and how many days
Love is just slipping away
How many seasons and how many years
In tears
How many centuries and how many lives live
In fear
