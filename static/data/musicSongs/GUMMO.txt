Lyrics:


Niggas iffy, uh, Blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got blicky, uh, drum it holds fifty, uh
Scum Gang

Pop these niggas like a wheelie nigga, you a silly nigga
In the hood with them Billy niggas, and them Hoover niggas
You run up and they shooting niggas, we ain't hooping nigga
Yo KB, you a loser nigga, up that Uzi nigga
On the stoop, crills in my drawers, your girl on my phone
She wanna fuck but keep her clothes on, I only want the jaw
Man, that's really all I use her for, then I kick her out the door
I don't want her, you can keep the whore, she fiending for some more
In New York my niggas don't Milly Rock, my niggas money bop
Blow a case a nigga throwing shots, I run 'em off they block
Quarter milli in the stash box, I grinded for my spot
Niggas talking 'bout that cash but my bag worth a lot
I don't fuck with no old hoes, only new hoes
Put my dick in her backbone, I pass her to my bro
I don't love her that's a sad hoe, she a bad hoe
I'mma fuck her then I dash home to the cash hoe

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch

Niggas iffy, uh, Blicky got the stiffy uh
Got blicky, uh, drum it holds fifty, uh
Move milli, all my niggas on fifty, uh
Talk down, you silly, uh
Hit a stain, fifty bands, all hunnids
Spinning through ya block like a pop shove it
Shoot at me I'm shooting back, I'm getting buckets
I ain't wanna take his life but nigga, fuck it

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch
I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch

Scum Gang
