Lyrics:


I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

Wasted (wasted)
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby every place I go reminds me of you

Do you think of me
Of what we used to be?
Is it better now
That I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange
They don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
I see but don't believe it
Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

Do you think of me
Of what we used to be?
Is it better now
That I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange
They don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know
Oh I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

Wasted
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Do you think that I should just go on without you

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
