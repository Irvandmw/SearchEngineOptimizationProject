Lyrics:


Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say "baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game (Sing it y'all)
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say "baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

Any other day, I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh, okay"
Could it be that you at the crib with another lady?
(Sing)

(I know you that I am assuming things)
Something's going down, that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange)
If nobody's holding you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
When you say everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name (Boy, say my name)
If no one is around you
Say "baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name (Say my name, say my, say)
You actin' kinda shady (Say my name)
Ain't callin' me baby (Ooh, yeah)
Why the sudden change? (Sudden)
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
Say my, say my, say my name
Say my, say my
Say my name boy, say my name
Yeah, say

You better say my name
'Cause something feels strange
I'm filing a complaint
I'm just askin' you to say my name
