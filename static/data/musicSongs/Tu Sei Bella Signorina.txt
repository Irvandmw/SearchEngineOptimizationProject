Lyrics:


Tu sei bella signorina
You're the flower of Napoli
Tu sei bella signorina
I wish I could tell you what you mean to me

Strollin' down the via Roma
Proud as a princess of yore
Tu sei bella signorina
You're the one I've been waiting for

Tu sei bella signorina
You're the one I've been waiting for
