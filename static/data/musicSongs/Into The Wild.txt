Lyrics:


Drown me in slow motion
Steal the breath I'm holding
You could take it with your smile
Chase me in the darkness
Kiss me like you're heartless
Then run away and hide

Cause I'll follow you
Into the wild

Roll me like the thunder
Let me feel your hunger
For me tonight
When your heart is broken
I'll suck out all the poison
When the viper bites

And I'll follow you
Into the wild
Into the wild
And I'll follow you
Into the wild
Into the wild

I won't change you
I won't tame you
I won't change you
I won't tame you, no

I can be your landslide
And you can be my fault line
Let's jump and shake the earth

'Cause I'll follow you
Into the wild
Into the wild
And I'll follow you
Into the wild
Into the wild
Into the wild (change you)
Into the wild (tame you)
Into the wild (change you)
(Tame you)
(Change you)
Into the wild (tame you)
