Lyrics:


I am with you
Wandering through memory lane
Living the years laughter and tears over again
I am dreaming yet of the night we met
When life was a lovely refrain

You were so shy saying goodbye there in the dark
Only a glance full of romance and you were gone
Though my dreams are in vain
My love will remain
Strolling again memory lane with you

I am dreaming yet of the night we met
When life was a lovely refrain
You were so shy saying goodbye there in the dark
Only a glance full of romance and you were gone
Though my dreams are in vain
My love will remain
Strolling again memory lane with you
