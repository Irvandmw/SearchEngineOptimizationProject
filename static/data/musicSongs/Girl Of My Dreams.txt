Lyrics:


Girl of my dreams, I love you 
Honest I do, you are so sweet 
If I could just hold your charms  
Again in my arms  
Then, life would be complete! 

Since you've been gone, dear 
Life don't seem the same 
Please come back again! 

And after all's said an' done 
There's only one  
Girl of my dreams, it's you! 

[instrumental break]

Since you've been gone, dear 
Life don't seem the same 
Please come back again! 

And after all's said an' done 
There's only one  
Girl of my dreams, it's you!
