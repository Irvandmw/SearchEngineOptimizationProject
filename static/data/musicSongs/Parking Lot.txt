Lyrics:


You caught me off guard, and oh
Hey, I'm pleased to meet ya
Don't know if you can hold me but
I gotta honor it, yeah
Depending on the minute and depending on the hours
I guess I got some time to waste so
We can chop away the hours, yeah

Cool, so let's see and then let's talk
And then let's walk, yeah, and then, and then
Let's see, and then less walking, and less talking
And we'll see
Yeah!

Bring your car to the parking lot
And ride all night till you get a spot
Cause we ain't doing nothing
No we ain't doing nothing
Me-Meet us in the parking lot
We're gonna turn the speakers up
Cause we ain't doing nothing
We ain't doing nothing

Na na na, ley ley, ah ah ha
Eh hey eh
Na na na, ley ley, ah ah ha
Eh hey eh

I'm telling all my friends that it's pretty casual
They're turning green with envy
Seeing me while I'm riding with ya, with ya, with ya
Depending on the minute and depending on the hours
I mean depending on the chemicals yeah we can make some power, yeah

Cool, so let's see and then let's talk
And then let's walk, yeah, and then, and then
Let's see, and then less walking, and less talking
And we'll see
Yeah!

Bring your car to the parking lot
And ride all night till you get a spot
Cause we ain't doing nothing
No we ain't doing nothing
Me-Meet us in the parking lot
We're gonna turn the speakers up
Cause we ain't doing nothing
We ain't doing nothing

Na na na, ley ley, ah ah ha
Eh hey eh
Na na na, ley ley, ah ah ha
Eh hey eh

Hand in hand and arm in arm
Take me to your favorite barn
We can dance in the mud
Get slippery, show me all your thuggery
Let's dance in the rain, get fancy
Nothing unusual all about it
You're just a regular guy, and there's no way around it
If, if, if you walk with me then we can talk about it
If you can walk the talk then we'll see what we do about it

Bring your car to the parking lot
And ride all night till you get a spot
Cause we ain't doing nothing
No we ain't doing nothing
Me-Meet us in the parking lot
We're gonna turn the speakers up
Cause we ain't doing nothing
We ain't doing nothing

Bring your car to the parking lot
And ride all night till you get a spot
Cause we ain't doing nothing
No we ain't doing nothing
Me-Meet us in the parking lot
We're gonna turn the speakers up
Cause we ain't doing nothing
We ain't doing nothing

Na na na, ley ley, ah ah ha
Eh hey eh
Na na na, ley ley, ah ah ha
Eh hey eh
Na na na, ley ley, ah ah ha
Eh hey eh
Na na na, ley ley, ah ah ha
Eh hey eh

HEY!

[Outro:]

We can dance if you wanna dance
If you wanna dance
If not then I can show ya
We can dance if you wanna dance
If you wanna dance
If not then I can show ya
We can dance if you wanna dance if not I can show ya!
We can dance if you wanna dance
If you wanna dance
If not then I can show ya
