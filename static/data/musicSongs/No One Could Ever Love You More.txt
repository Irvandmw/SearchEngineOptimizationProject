Lyrics:


When lady love treated you unkind
I gave you courage and food for your mind 
With blind faith I kept my love strong
Through those empty nights they were lonely long

Who's loving you so tough?
Didn't I give enough?
Oh baby

No one could ever love you more
There will never be another
No one could ever love you more
Not your mother father sister brother
No no, yeah... oh yeah

The time has come for me to take a step
Now you can have your freedom
If I don't fit in your plans
You're part of me and I'm part of you
But being less than number one
Baby just won't do

No who's loving me so tough?
Didn't I give you enough?
You should know that

No one could ever love you more
There will never be another
No one could ever love you more
Not your mother father sister brother
No no yeah oh yeah

Yeah no one could ever love you more
There will never be another
No one could ever love you more
No no 

Oh no one could ever love you more
You know that I'm you woman
No one could ever love you more
There'll never be another
Not your mother father sister brother
No one
