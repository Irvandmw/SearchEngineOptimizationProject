Lyrics:


[RM:]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Lil Nas X:]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[RM:]
I got the homis in my bag (Yeah)
Have you heard of that? (Yeah)
Homis made of steel 
From Korea, they the best-t-t
Riding to the farm (Huh)
Grabbing all the corn (Huh)
We gon' get yo' money 
With my homi in your backyard

[Lil Nas X, Both:]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[RM:]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
