Lyrics:


A lot of love
A lot of love
A lot of love
A lot of love

Feels like the world is on your shoulders
Don't let em get you down
Through all the prejudice and violence
Your heart still can smile, you gotta go
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
And all the pain will go away, starting today

It's time to help each other try
You can do it all it takes is, a lot of love
I need it, a lot of love
Cause I'm giving, a lot of love
Yeah, a lot of love
A lot of love

Things are gonna be the way that they should be
With all the children running freely
No more war on TV
Open your heart and then you'll finally succeed
Hey, and everyone will finally be free

It's time to help each other try
You can do it all it takes is, a lot of love
I need it, a lot of love
Cause I'm giving, a lot of love
Yeah, a lot of love
A lot of love
