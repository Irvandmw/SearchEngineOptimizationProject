Lyrics:


Last night I took a walk in the snow:
Couples holding hands, places to go.
Seems like everyone but me is in love.
Santa, can you hear me?

I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss.
I sent it off. It just said this.
I know exactly what I want this year.
Santa, can you hear me?

I want my baby, baby.
I want someone to love me.
Someone to hold.
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
He'll be all my own in a big red bow.

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year.
And all I want is one thing.
Tell me my true love is near.

He's all I want. Just for me.
Underneath my Christmas tree.
I'll be waiting here.
Santa, that's my only wish this year.

Christmas Eve. I just can't sleep.
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
Santa, can you hear me?

I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh.
Oh, please make my wish come true.
Santa, can you hear me?

I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe (maybe maybe)
We'll be all the love under the mistletoe

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year.
And all I want is one thing.
Tell me my true love is near.

He's all I want. Just for me.
Underneath my Christmas tree.
I'll be waiting here.
Santa, that's my only wish this year.

I hope my letter reaches you in time.
Bring me love I can call all mine.
'Cause I have been so good, so good this year.

Can't be alone under the mistletoe.
He's all I want in a big red bow.

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year.
And all I want is one thing.
Tell me my true love is near.

He's all I want. Just for me.
Underneath my Christmas tree.
I'll be waiting here.
Santa, that's my only wish this year.

Oh, Santa, can't you hear me?
Oh, Santa.

Well, he's all I want. Just for me.
Underneath my Christmas tree.
I'll be waiting here.
Santa, that's my only wish this year.
Santa, that's my only wish this year.
