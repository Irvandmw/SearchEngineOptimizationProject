Lyrics:


Back at school they all thought I was an outcast, car crash
"A hopeless fool," they said to me.
And my girlfriend said I messed up. Will I ever grow up?
In the end, I'm not gonna

What was I thinking?
Everyone sees it
It's not a secret
That I'm just a reject
Sick of the system
Don't wanna hear it
It's not a secret
That I'm just a reject

I'm just a reject

My teacher said I was mentally disabled, so unstable
So I'll stay in bed all day
Save your breath. You can talk at me, but I'm not listening
If this is a test, then I'm probably failing

What was I thinking?
Everyone sees it
It's not a secret
That I'm just a reject
Sick of the system
Don't wanna hear it
It's not a secret
That I'm just a reject

They try to save me, but I'm too far gone
And they call me crazy so I played along
And you wanna change me, but I'm on my own

La da da da da, la da da da duh [2x]

What was I thinking?
Everyone sees it
It's not a secret
That I'm just a reject
Sick of the system
Don't wanna hear it
It's not a secret
That I'm just a reject

I'm just a reject [2x]
