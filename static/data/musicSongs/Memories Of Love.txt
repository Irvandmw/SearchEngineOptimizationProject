Lyrics:


A warm summer night
The moon above us
The stars for a wish come true
Are memories of love
A motionless pound
A beautiful swan
The smell of flowers growing near
Make me shed a tear
Memories of love gone by
Make me stop and cry
Now I kneel and pray
For the lord took her today
And all that's left to think of
Are memories of her love
