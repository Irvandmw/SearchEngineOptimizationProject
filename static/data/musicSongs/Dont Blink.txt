Lyrics:


I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said, "All I can say is

Don't blink
Just like that
You're six years old and you take a nap
And you wake up and you're twenty-five
And your high-school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss
Your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads
Next thing you know
Your better half of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend
A hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink."

Well I was glued to my TV
When it looked like he looked at me
And said, "Best start putting first things first
'Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breath God gives you for what it's worth

Don't blink
'Cause just like that
You're six years old and you take a nap
And you wake up and you're twenty-five
And your high-school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss
Your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads
Next thing you know
Your better half of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend
A hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink."

So I've been tryna slow it down
I've been tryna take it in
In this here-today-gone-tomorrow world we're livin' in

Don't blink
Just like that
You're six years old and you take a nap
And you wake up and you're twenty-five
And your high-school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss
Your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads
Next thing you know
Your better half of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend
A hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

No, don't blink
Don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
So don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
Don't blink
Don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
