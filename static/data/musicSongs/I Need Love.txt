Lyrics:


Came a long way, we was trapping out the days and
Now I spend my days up in mansions with Caucasians
Fat bitches chilling with my dogs like we caged in
Got it from the bottom, had to make it from the pavement
Niggas say I changed, fuck it, that's just how the game go
All these chains, all these fucking whips, I'm in slave mode
Hood rich, put your baby mama on my pay roll
OHB mafia, my niggas keep a bank roll

You know that Bentley truck's on the way, Bentley truck's on the way, I bought her a coupe
You know shoulda played it cool by the way, played it cool by the way, played it cool
You know, you know the rules from the game, what games are you tryna play? Better be cool
You know, you think I'm a fool, first mistake, by the way
Pull in that foreign, driving that hearses, hating on my house
You on the 'gram, say being nosey, you showing off
When he around, barely act like she know me, but you know now
All I'm seeing is diamonds and Rollies, fuck the account

All these women on me, only need one
I just wanted you to fucking be one
100's in my pockets, I'mma need one
I don't mind spending cause I need love
Baby it ain't tricking if you need love
Yeah, baby it ain't tricking if you need love

Look, look, keep telling my bitches I got it, I got it
I'm hopping, I'm pushing, my dreams are designer
She Asian and Spanish, my bitch from Atlanta
I give her that dick and my bitch, she be wilding
All these bitches, I just need one
Cuffing bitches, that's the season
Cashed out, on another plug
'Nother, other plug when I hold something
Niggas be sticking their bands up
A couple choppers I put in their fencing
Couple of Lambos, my niggas be racing
You talking that shit, put a price on your head
You niggas be pussy, be fucking with feds
And all of us kings so off with your head
Your bitch on my couch, she can't sleep on my bed
I'm popping that dirty, I'm taking my meds

All these women on me, only need one
I just wanted you to fucking be one
100's in my pockets, I'mma need one
I don't mind spending cause I need love
Baby it ain't tricking if you need love
Yeah, baby it ain't tricking if you need love

Double cup, I'm rolling up
Smelling jasmine straight from Mexico
In Hollyweird, bitches can't fuck a check up
Ain't none of 'em mine cause it's Hollywood
Pull in that foreign, driving that hearses, hating on my house
You on the 'gram, say being nosey, you showing off
When he around, barely act like she know me, but you know now
All I'm seeing is diamonds and Rollies, fuck the account

All these women on me, only need one
I just wanted you to fucking be one
100's in my pockets, I'mma need one
I don't mind spending cause I need love
Baby it ain't tricking if you need love
Yeah, baby it ain't tricking if you need love
Need love, it ain't tricking if you need love
Need love, baby it ain't tricking if you need love
