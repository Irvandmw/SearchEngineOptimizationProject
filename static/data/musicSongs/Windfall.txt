Lyrics:


Have you ever heard the windfall
Have you ever heard the leaves call
Take a look inside your feelings
Hear the music as the river sings

And if you've never heard these things
Then love has flown on faceless wings
'Cause that's where love begins, within' you

Have you ever watched an eagle as she flies
Spinning circles in the corner's of the sky
Do you wonder why she's hiding in the night
Does she wonder why you're hiding in the light

And if you've never heard these things
Then love has flown on faceless wings
'Cause that's where love begins, within' you

Have you ever heard the windfall
Have you ever heard the leaves call
Can you feel the truth within' you
Can you see yourself begin to

And if you've never heard these things
Then love has flown on faceless wings
'Cause that's where love begins, within' you

And if you've never heard these things
Then love has flown on faceless wings
'Cause that's where love begins, within' you
