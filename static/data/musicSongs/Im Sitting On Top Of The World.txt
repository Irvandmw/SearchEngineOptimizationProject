Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I'm sitting on top of the world
Rolling along, rolling along, yeah
And I'm quitting the blues of the world, yeah
Singing a song and rolling along

"Glory Hallelujah" I just called the Parson
"Hey, Parson get ready to call"
Oh, just like Humpty Dumpty
I'm going to fall

Oh, and I'm sitting on top, top of the world
Mmm, rolling along, mmm, singing a song

Don't want any millions cause I'm getting my shares
I've only got one dress, oh, that's all I can wear
A bundle of money won't make you feel gay
I've got a little honey who's making me say, oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm sitting right up on top, on top of the world
Oh, rolling along, I've got to sing my song
Don't you know, don't you know that I'm quitting the blues of the world?
Mmm, rolling along, let me sing my song

"Glory Hallelujah" I just phoned the Parson
"Hey, Parson get ready to call"
Oh, just like Humpty Dumpty
I'm going to fall

Oh, and I'm sitting right up on top, on top of the world
Oh, rolling along, let me sing my song
Don't you know I'm quitting the blues, the blues of the world
Oh, rolling along, I've got to sing my song
Don't you know that I'm sitting up on top of the world?
And I said that I'm quitting the blues of the world
