Lyrics:


[Elton John:]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
B-B-B-Bennie, B-B-B-Bennie

[Pink:]
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
But they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen

[Pink (Logic):]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine (yeah)
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Logic:]
Let me get it now, Momma I made it
True story, I have upgraded
Everbody back then used to hate it
Now they all appreciate it
I might sound out of my mind, matter of fact out of line
But I been runnin' and gunnin', gettin' it for myself in due time
I'm finna take it to the line, I'm in the beginning of the prime
Tony Montana the world's mine
Yeah, it's finally 'bout time
Went from Section 8 to better times
Serving food to writin' rhymes
For Elton John, the greatest of all-time

[Pink:]
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Pink (Logic):]
Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets (yeah yeah)
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Ohh, Bennie and the Jets
