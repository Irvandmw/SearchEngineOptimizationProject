Lyrics:


Listen to me baby
Somethin' you must see
I wanna be with you girl
If you wanna be with me

But if you gotta go, oh it's alright
If you gotta go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night

It ain't that I'm suggestin' you
Should take part in any kind of quiz
It's just that I ain't got no watch
And you keep askin' me what time it is

But if you gotta go, oh it's alright
If you gotta go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night

I am just a poor boy baby
Tryin' to connect
I certainly don't want you thinkin'
That I haven't got any respect

But if you gotta go, oh it's alright
If you gotta go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night

It ain't that I'm asking anything
That you never did before
It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon
And it's too dark for you to find the door

But if you gotta go, oh it's alright
If you gotta go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night

But if you gotta go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night

But if you gotta go, go now
Or else you gotta stay all night
