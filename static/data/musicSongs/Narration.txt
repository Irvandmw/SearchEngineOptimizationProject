[Johnny]
I remember teachin' my brother Tommy shoot fire crackers
Both of us gettin' our fingers busted you remember that Tom
Daddy started Christmas mornin' with a stick of dynamite
And he made sure ev'rybody else was up

[Tommy]
When daddy gets up he wants to make sure ev'rybody else in the world is up too
[Johnny]
He did when we were kids remember when he could get dynamite bang Joy To The World
[Don:] What was is like up in the Stanton Virginia about that time of the year Harold
[Harold]
Oh we had I guess about like ev'rybody's Christmas it's always that Christmasy feeling
I remember one year I had an uncle that came in filled with the spirit
And he was lovin' all us kids and ev'rything and we's tryin' to get away from him
And he fell in the Christmas tree and knocked it over
We stood him up in the corner and decorated him
I don't remember what I got that year but I remember what he got
My mama run him out of the house finally
