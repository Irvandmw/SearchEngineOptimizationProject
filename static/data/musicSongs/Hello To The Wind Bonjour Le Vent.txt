Lyrics:


Hello, hello to the wind
Will you carry my song
Gently along as you sing

Hello, hello to the wind
You have my story to tell
Weaving your spell as you sing

Softly, listening to every word, anxious to please
Gently whispering all that you've heard to the trees

Hello, hello to the wind
Wish you'd take me along
And follow my song as you sing
As you sing, hello to the wind
Hello to the wind, hello to the wind
Hello to the wind
