Lyrics:


The bells, the bells,
Ringing everywhere for the sound of christmas is in the air,
The bells, the bells,
From the steeple above, telling us it's the season of love,
Ring out,
Let the tale be told that inspires the dream of the young and old,
Love, love,
Let your hearts unfold, for the bells of christmas are ringing.

The bells, the bells,
On a wintry night, with the friendly fire burning warm and bright,
The bells, the bells,
On the steeple above, telling us it's the season of love.
Ring out,
Let the tale be told, that inspires the dream of the young and old,
Love, love,
Let your hearts unfold, for the bells of christmas are ringing.

The bells, the bells,
They've been here and now, to a world that almost forgotten how
The bells, the bells,
From the steeple above, telling us it's the season of love.
Ring out,
Let the tale be told that inspires the dream of the young and old,
Love, love,
Let your hearts unfold, for the bells of christmas are ringing.
The bells of christmas are ringing.
