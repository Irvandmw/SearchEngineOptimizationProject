Lyrics:


I went down to St.James Infirmary
Saw my baby there
Sat down on a long white table
So sweet, so cold, so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She can look this wide world over
She'll never find a sweet man like me

When I die I want you to dress me in straight lace shoes
Boxback coat and a Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So the boysâll know that I died standin' pat
