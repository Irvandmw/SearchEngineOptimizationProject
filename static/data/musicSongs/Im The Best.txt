Lyrics:


I'm the best, the best on the ice you see.
I put the rest to the test but no one skates like me.
So if you see my on the rink
take one look and I think you'll agree 
that I'm as cool as can be...
yeah.

Spinnin' like a top I just can't stop.
Now figure eights? Piece of cake.
Look out now, I'm comin' through.
I'm hoppin' higher than a kangaroo!

Watch me go!
Such style, such grace!
I never, ever come in second place!

Ha!
I can do this stuff in my sleep.
Like, literally while I'm countin' sheep.

But when it comes to speed
soy alla me hor!
I've never been beaten in a race before.
So I'm not gonna stop 'till it's totally clear
that I'm the only real skater here.
Yeah, I'm the only real skater here.

Now listen up 'cause you're cramping my style!
Yeah I've been sharing the ice for a while.
From now on let's get one thing straight.
I'm the only one who's allowed to skate!

I'm the best, the best on the ice you see.
I put the rest to the test but no one skates like me.
So if you see me on the rink
take one look and I think you'll agree
that I'm as cool as can be...
yeah.

Yeah...
