Lyrics:


May I be allowed to voice dissent 
Over the Sixties, and what they meant 
Cos Iâve been listening for twenty years 
The anecdotes ring in my ears 
From people who were over the age of consent

Now I donât recall too much long hair 
At least not around where we used to stay
The only guy we thought was okay 
Who wore his hair the Beatles way 
Was a Belfast boy that Man United play

Motherâs Pride on the table, Batman on TV 
A Man in a Suitcase, and Daktari and Skippy
Jimmy Clitheroe, Colin Stein, and Lulu selling tea
Going to school in the dark, in the winter 

The view from beneath my balaclava
The world from four feet off the floor
Must have had its limitations 
Without my adult complications 
But I can only report what I saw 

And I sawâ¦ 

Lucky bags, Bazooka Joes, animal tracks on my shoes 
I was sooking milk through a straw
in the middle of the morning
Saturday morning pictures, and fireworks getting thrown 
Football songs in the shelter in the playground 
St Cuthbertâs horses pulling the carts of the milkmen

You know, itâs funny, but 
I donât recall too much long hair
