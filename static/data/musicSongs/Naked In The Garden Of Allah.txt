Lyrics:


We are naked
We are innocent
We are deadly
We are broken
We are ignorant
We are lost

We are children
We are discontent
We are fatal
We are broken
We are impotent
We are lost

This televised democracy (we seek protection)
Such adolescent fantasy (we seek refuge)
Random access to content
I think we're naked in the garden of allah

We are artless
We are violent
We are poison
We are broken

Pie in the sky and gingerbread (we seek protection)
We never meant to get in bed (we seek refuge)
With wannabe intelligentsia
I think we're naked in the garden of allah

Just remember,
I'll remember
