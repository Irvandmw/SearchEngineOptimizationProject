Lyrics:


I'm Confessin' that I love you,
Tell me do you love me too
I'm Confessin' that I need you, honest I do

In your eyes I read such strange things
But your lips deny they are true
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue

I'm afraid someday you'll leave me
Saying can't we still be friends
If you go you'll grieve me
All in life on you depends

I'm I guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams of you in vain
I'm Confessin' that I love you
Over again
