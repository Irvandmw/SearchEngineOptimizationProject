Lyrics:


Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh
Firzt on the track

She fuck me like she love me
I think I like her on the low (Oh)
She fuck me like she love me
I wonder why but I don't know (No)
She fuck me like she love me
Tryna make me fall in love (Oh yeah)
You tryna make me fall in love (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
She tryna make me fall in love (Ooh, ooh)
She fuck me like she love me

I gotta skip outta town
Call her phone, she come over put that dick in her mouth
She stood me up against the wall and made me sit on the couch
She got that Tylenol PM, soon as I hit it, I'm out
And she be starin' at a nigga while I'm sleep, she say I'm pretty
Got 100 bitches in my phone and all them hoes I did it
I be in and out of town, from state to state to handle business
Soon as I get off the road I hit her phone because

She fuck me like she love me
I think I like her on the low (Oh)
She fuck me like she love me
I wonder why but I don't know (No)
She fuck me like she love me
Tryna make me fall in love (Oh yeah)
You tryna make me fall in love (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
She tryna make me fall in love (Ooh, ooh)
She fuck me like she love me

I'm talkin' three times in a row (Three times in a row)
In that pussy, I'm as deep as I can go (Deep as I can go)
Shh, I'm tryna keep it on the low (Keep it on the low)
But right now, fuck what they think and what they know
'Cause she done made a young nigga fuck around and reconsider
Cut off all them other women, I want her 'cause she the realest
I'm a dog and I admit it, so I keep her in her feeling
But I might switch up the game, say fuck them bitches 'cause

She fuck me like she love me
I think I like her on the low (Oh)
She fuck me like she love me
I wonder why but I don't know (No)
She fuck me like she love me
Tryna make me fall in love (Oh yeah)
You tryna make me fall in love (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
She tryna make me fall in love (Ooh, ooh)
She fuck me like she love me
