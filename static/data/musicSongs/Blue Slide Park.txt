Lyrics:


Blue Slide Park, itâs Blue slide park man

Hey, I got these Ray-Ban shades, kinda look like something Lennon would rock
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louie shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but Iâm still blowing thousands on it
No clue what Iâm calling my album
Fans be at my van screaming, calling me Malcom
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account looking like a George Young stash house
Young and acting out, the topics that I rap about
Be varying from politics to bitches pulling asses out
Thatâs exactly how I do this as a rapper
Iâm nuttinâ in her mouth, you tongue kissing her after
Daughtersâ moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on their cooter
Have the music sounding better then guitar tuners
Plus Iâm doing shows daily call me John Stewart
So who you know thatâs iller than Mac Miller and company
Itâs like I planted money seeds right underneath the fucking tree
Now I got a hundred gâs so none of yaâll can fuck with me
Yeah I said it publicly so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker

Hold up Jerm let me spit the second
Hey yo I breeze past haters In the E-class quickly
And deep did a hundred songs in six weeks
Shit keeps going on and on
We just tryna go bananas like itâs Donkey Kong
Yeah on my grind, always need to work
So I be eatinâ good, you be eatinâ dirt
If you talking shit, you gonna see me smirk
While the DJ be scratching til the needles burst
A couple screws probably loose in my head
Holla at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed
Iâm a regular guy with an irregular life
Except Iâm a Lamborghini if itâs racing a bike
Who knew that I can turn some sound into something so cool
Fresh kicks, see me Iâm busting the moves
Coming in soon to a theater near you
Creep in your kitchen start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck I donât be in the mood
No time for pussy when moneyâs in the room, Oh
I switch flows, switch rhythm
Sick spittinâ, unlimited ammunition

Blue Slide Park
