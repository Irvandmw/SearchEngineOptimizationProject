Lyrics:


You're all I ever had
You're all I'll ever need
It's been so long
You're like the atmosphere
I breathe in

When I think of little things
There's a little bell that rings
And a little voice that sings my song with me
You're all I ever loved
You're all I can recall

I've seen so much
And you've been with me
Through it all
When I think of funny things
And the joy your laughter brings
Turning winter into spring
It warms my soul

I want today to last forever
I want forever and a day
I wanna hear your voice each morning
And when the moon is on its way

I want today to last forever
I want forever and a day
I wanna hear your voice each morning
And when the moon is on its way

We're all we ever had
And somehow we both knew
That one alone
Without the other
Wouldn't do

If there's heaven far beyond
I hope my goddess is a blonde
And that she has a magic wand
And looks like you
