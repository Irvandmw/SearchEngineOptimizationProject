Lyrics:


Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
(Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba)

Birds always sing, bells always ring
Whether it's summer or winter or spring
Be like the birds, just add the words
And sing this happy song

Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
(Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba)

Don't ever cry, I'll tell you why
You can't see the sky with a tear in your eye
Be like the sun, smile just for fun
And sing this happy song

Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
(Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba)

Look at everywhere love's in the air
Dance through your life with a devil-may-care
Look in your heart then you will start
To sing this happy song

Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
(Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba)
Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
Ma come beli bella bimba, bella bimba, bella bimba
