Lyrics:


I said I didn't need you baby
I said I'd get along
I thought I can make it without you baby
But I guess I'm not that strong
And I didn't know I could miss you so
Until you were gone

I said I'd get over you baby
I said I'd be alright
Just, just when I start remembering
That all the hurt comes back in the night
And I didn't know I could miss you so
Until you were gone

I tried to stay away cause I knew I couldn't win
But here I am, and I'm back again
I tried to find someone else to take your place
But everytime I close my eyes I can see in, see in your face

Oh, oh, oh, I said I'd forget you
Cause I really thought, I really thought that I could
Oh, oh, I thought I could stop of loving you
I tried it, but it didn't do no good
And I didn't know I could miss you so
Until you were gone

I said I'd get over you baby
I said I'd be alright
But, oh, oh, just when I start remembering
It comes back in the night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I thought I could
Oh baby
