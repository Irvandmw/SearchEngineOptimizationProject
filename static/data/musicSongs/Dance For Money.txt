Lyrics:


I like them over 50 (oh, really?)
I like to dance for money (oh, honey)
I like em over 50 (oh, honey)
I like to dance for money

Lemonade, motorcycles
Lemonade, motorcycles
Lemonade...

I'll be your private dancer
I wear my gold nail polish
You like the way I wear my hair up
I like your ivy lie...

I like em over 50 (uh huh)
I like to play for money (uh huh)
I like em over 50 (uh huh)
I like to play for money

Lemonade, motorcycles
Lemonade, motorcycles
Lemonade, motorcycles

I can be your summertime
Baby, you can call me May
I can be your champagne wine
You can love me in my gold lamÃ©

I'll be your private dancer (yes, yes I will)
I wear my gold nail polish (y-yes I will)
You like the I wear my hair up
I like your ivy lie

Yes, yes I do
Yes, yes I do
And I know
I need you for a while
I need you for a while (yes, yes)
I need you for a while (yes, yes, yes, yes)

I'll be your private dancer
I wear my gold nail polish
You like the way I wear my hair up
I like your ivy lie
(Yes, yes, I do, yes, yes)
I'll be your private dancer (yes)
I wear my gold nail polish
You like the way I wear my hair up
I like your ivy lie
