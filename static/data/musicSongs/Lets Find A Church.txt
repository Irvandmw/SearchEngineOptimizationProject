Lyrics:


Lately it takes both of us to drive this old chevy
The way that you keep kissinâ me is gettinâ hot and heavy
Iâll drive a million miles just to walk down the aisle beside you
This feelinâ between us is makinâ it obvious what we gotta do
Letâs find a church
Any one will work
Be it Baptist Methodist Lutheran episcipalion
How bout a country chapel A city tabernacle
As long as we can say I do Iâm gonna marry you
And be the luckiest man on this earth
Well I canât wait much longer lets find a church
It may be late but weâll try to wake up
Some ole preacher
And if that donât work weâll settle for a deacon or a Sunday school teacher
Weâre in a hurry so baby donât worry bout no dress
It donât matter if my jeans are tattered
Or if your hairâs a mess
Letâs find a church
Any one will work
Be it Baptist Methodist Lutheran presbyterian
How bout a country chapel A city tabernacle
As long as we can say I do Iâm gonna marry you
And be the luckiest man on this earth
Well I canât wait much longer letâs find a church
Letâs find a church
Any one will work
Be it Baptist Methodist Lutheran pentacostal
How bout a country chapel A city tabernacle
As long as we can say Iâm gonna marry you
And be the luckiest man on this earth
This feelinâs gettinâ stronger letâs find a church
Oh I do
