Lyrics:


[Future:]
You know I just bought another shovel
This shit we buried a lot of bags, you dig?
Wheezy beats

All this drip on me (Pluto)
Gotta keep an extra clip on me (I swear, yeah, yeah)
Keep it on me like ID (Future)
Ain't no swag for free (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Freebandz)
Yeah, trappin' out the Wraith in the winter (whatcha doin')
Yeah, I'm trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
You can't control my temper (facts)
I'll take your ho then pimp her (pimp her)
I'll make it look that simple (simple)
Swerve in this Bent like a rental (woah)

I keep a house out in Denver (yeah)
I got them racks in my denim (yeah)
I let my dog out the kennel (swear)
Patek or Phillippe on my drip (drink)
Yeah, yeah, and she don't want me to sip (pour up, pour up)
It's too much jealousy, niggas can't ever be real (can't)
I caught a felony, nigga, wasn't none of you here (hold on)
I work every day at this shit, like it can all disappear (swear)
I pray every day by this shit, when I go jump on a Leer (Super)
God protect me from all of the bogus of niggas, rogue us
Yeah, water me down like Pacific, my watch and my chain, my rings
Yeah, all the drip on me, I had to go change my name (yeah)
I came from Lil Mexico, this shit ain't gon' ever be the same (Freebandz)
I fuck her on the every day, but she ain't gon' ever get claimed

All this drip on me (Pluto)
Gotta keep an extra clip on me (I swear, yeah, yeah)
Keep it on me like ID (Future)
Ain't no swag for free (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Freebandz)
Yeah, trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
Yeah, I'm trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
You can't control my temper (facts)
I'll take your ho then pimp her (pimp her)
I'll make it look that simple (simple)
Swerve in this Bent like a rental (woah)

[Young Thug:]
I'm whippin' the Rover out (skrrt)
I got a plastic FN, a lil' under 4 pounds (woah, woah)
I send a jet to Miami to pick up his old pounds (O's, get it)
My bro got the shout it the long way
Repeat while you rollin' 'round (gotta repeat)
I'm doin' the same thing (you dig)
Lickin' molly like ramen (R.I.P.)
Getting head on the private plane
Cost me 23 thou' like LeBron James (LeBron James)
Might put me some gators on
And get in the 'Lac and just blow the brains (blow the brains)
I fuck on her face
I came fast like when Sonic came, oh, oh
Get on my level, dawg
I just want some rest, I'm just tryna ball
I spend a couple milli', on my nigga behind the wall (the chain gang)
I teach him the Feds are comin' (the band gang)
Don't say nothin' at all (don't say nothin' at all)
I got some chips on me (you dig?)
It's on my hip on me

[Future:]
All this drip on me (Pluto)
Gotta keep an extra clip on me (I swear, yeah, yeah)
Keep it on me like ID (Future)
Ain't no swag for free (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Freebandz)
Yeah, trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
Yeah, I'm trappin' out the Wraith in the winter
You can't control my temper (facts)
I'll take your ho then pimp her (pimp her)
I'll make it look that simple (simple)
Swerve in this Bent like a rental (woah)
