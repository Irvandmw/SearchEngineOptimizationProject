Lyrics:


I can't stop thinking about you
And dreaming of your smile
I can't stop reading into ya
Love, oh yeah, you're the best book I've read in a while
I don't just read you for the articles
I read you 'til my heart is full
You keep my heart a-beatin'
You're keeping me from sleeping
The only one I'm cheating is me if I don't take control

We got nothing to lose
Might as well hold hands
(Might as well!)
Yeah, we're already fools
So we might as well dance

I put your loving arms around me once more
And we'll go crashing in the folks on the dance floor
And you can walk all over my shoes if you want to

We got nothing to lose
Might as well take off our pants
(And jacket!)
Yeah, we're already fools
So we might as well dance
(Come on!)

Soon the song will be over
We'll have to say goodnight
Don't you want some closure
Before we turn out the light?
Honey, think of your heart
Yeah, the heart's too heavy to slow
Partly 'cause it's running the show
Partly 'cause the beat is connected to the feeling
And I've got the sweetest crush on you, baby, let's go

We've got nothing to lose
Might as well hold hands
Yeah, we're already fools
So we might as well dance

We've got nothing to prove
Might as well take off our pants
(And jacket!)
Yeah, we're already fools
So we might as well dance

Yeah, we're already fools
So we might as well dance
