Lyrics:


Well, you were waiting for me, you saw me, adored me
As I wish the whole world would
You would never hurt me, desert me or work me
For all the things you thought you could

And you would lick the tears from my eyes when I cry
How I missed you when I was gone
Hurt me so to leave you, deceive you, I needed you
I believed in you.

I, I never meant to let you down
I wait with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall apart

Now all I have is riches and pictures and stitches
Money could never buy what you give
And though my heart is achin' and breakin' I'm makin'
The most of what you send my way

Now I want just to hold you, unfold you, I told you
See, I am coming back for you
I know we will be okay every day
The sun shines a little brighter

I, I never meant to let you down
I wait with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall apart

I never meant to let you down
I wait with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I'm trying not to fall apart

We'll re-unite, we'll set a light
I'm pushing with all of my might

Oh, no, I never meant to let you down
(I wait with a stake in my heart)
I never meant to put you down
(I'm trying not to fall apart)
I never meant to let you down
(I wait with a stake in my heart)
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall
