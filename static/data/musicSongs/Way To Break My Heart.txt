Lyrics:


Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinking 'bout her

And her lips upon mine, so soft
Feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love
Oh why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason or have you found someone else?

So tell me, girl
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the mornin' comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my

First love never dies
Guess I'll see you in another life
Twelve years down the line
There's just one thing I remember

Her lips upon mine, so soft
Feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love
Oh why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason or have you found someone else?

So tell me, girl
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the mornin' comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my
(Heart)
That's the way to break my

That's the
That's the
That's the
Did I, did I
That's the
That's the

That's the way to break my
