Lyrics:


I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions

You are the champions, my friends
And you'll keep on fighting till the end
You are the champions
You are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause you are the champions
Of the world
