Lyrics:


Yeah. Never had a lot I swear we all came up from nothinâ mayne.
Gotta do it for state (for the state).
Yeah.
Anybody got a problem witâ it, then we ridinâ mayne.
We say what we wanna say.

âOf course we do. We wake up when we wanna wake up. We do what we wanna do.
Iâm not bragging, Iâm just saying. Somebody said Iâm too confident.
Youâre right, Iâm the only confident rapper in the worldâ¦â

[Verse 1]
Been the man, thatâs why Iâm going in on any instrumental thatâll catch a leak.
Took a break to get the business straight, then I come right back and never miss a beat.
It ainât another as sick as me, and anybody that disagree can go out a helicopter now and donât try to breath âtil you hit the seat.
Most people only call you up when they want something, like the horny chick.
The green ainât what you gonna get, but Iâma hang it up like an ornament.
I promise yâall that I ainât have it all. Lord knows I wanât born as rich.
They keep tellinâ me that I should pass the rock I gotta get some points, itâs no more assists.
Get crossed over with the cross over. See the cross holder got my charm colder
Like itâs October in a dark Rover.
Gotta stunt on âem Iâma car show ya, like Iâm John Wall watch âem all fall
Like a power forward that was non-sober
If youâre loyal then I got it all for you. Itâs Chamillitary letâs ball soldier.

[Chorus]
Some say they donât like me
Some say Iâm amazing (amazing, amazing)
Some say Iâm too cocky, some tell me Iâm jaded.
If Iâm jaded, then Iâm jaded. But Iâll make it. (mhmm)
Thatâs why I go hard go hard go hard for my whole squad âtil we make it (mhmm) [x2]
We came up from nothinâ but we gone live so good [x3]
We came up from nothinâ see you there when we make it. (weâll make it)

[Verse 2]
They say it all, but donât mean it all.
Man what yâall tryinâ to be politicians?
Herman Cainâs none of yâall.
Gonna make it in the Oval Office, no competition.
I got the vision, donât got permission, but that donât mean theyâll stop the mission
That donât mean cause they got opinions that Iâll pop a squat like Iâm âbout to listen
If youâre fake then weâll see youâre fake, it ainât really no fakinâ that
Youâll never make it in these woods, hope that you got a safety pack
Everybody want a favor now, I ainât never had faith in that
Donât come to me with your hands out if you ainât showinâ up with no cake attached
âCause they got it locked, Iâm gone break the latch
But this ainât about what Iâm âbout to get
Rep the Texas; anytime I left I came back to Texas like Popovitch
Some people tell me Iâm cocky, but I just feel like Iâm confident
Everybody else is about sloppiness, and Iâm opposite so Iâm moppinâ it.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You got all the answers, go and get the same results.
People tryinâ to do evil, but you canât let them boys change your thoughts.
To tell the truth I have a few friends that didnât realize that I cut âem off
But if you knew me then you should know that I hate pessimism plus Iâm a boss
Take a trip back around the world, it ainât a place where I ainât stood.
Never ever claim to be gangsta but keep it gangsta like they should.
They donât even know who they are,
This the reason they ainât good, they ainât comfortable in their own styles
Their rhyming patterns are Ace Hoodâs
