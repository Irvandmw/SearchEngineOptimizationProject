Lyrics:


[Outer Space]

I can still taste the ocean like it was today
You said, "Please, keep on holding your hands."
And the rainâit came too soon.
I will wait for you
To love me again

I guess I was running from something
I was running back to you
Lost here in London with nothing
I'm still running back to you

If you can love me again
I could let go of everything

If I was an island in search of castaways
Maybe I'll find you here
And the rainâit came too soon.
I will wait for you
To love me again

I guess I was running from something
I was running back to you
Lost here in London with nothing
I'm still running back to you
If you can love me again
I could let go of everything

[4x]
The darkest night
Never felt so bright
With you by my side

[4x]
Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
When you're in outer space, when you're in outer space

[2x]
Love me like you did, love me like you did
I'll give you anything, I'll give you anything

[Carry On]

Carry on, let the good times roll
Sail along, let your path unfold
It won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better,
You know it's gonna get better

Say a prayer for the broken bones
'Cause who cares? We're all going home
And it won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better,
You know it's gonna get better

I got one foot in the golden life,
One foot in the gutter
So close to the other side,
So far from the wonder
I got one foot in the golden life,
One foot in the gutter
So sick of the tug of war,
That keeps pulling me under

Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll

Carry on,
Outlast the ignorance
Moving on,
Survive the innocence
Won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better
