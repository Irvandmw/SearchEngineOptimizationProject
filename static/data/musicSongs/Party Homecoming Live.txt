Lyrics:


I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking 'til the morning light

Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party!

You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
You got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu (Ooh)

As a black woman
I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box
And black women often feel underestimated
I wanted us to be proud of not only the show
But the process
Proud of the struggle
Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history
And rejoice in the pain
Rejoice in the imperfections
And the wrongs that are so damn right
And I wanted everyone to feel grateful for their
Their curves, their sass, their honesty
Thankful for their freedom
