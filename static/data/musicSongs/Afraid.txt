Lyrics:


I'm America's sweetheart tryna get away
You make it hard to leave,
But it's easier for me to stay,
Why I'm so afraid

And I've had it up to here with the fighting
Baby, we're not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But, boy, I'm so afraid

But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

So, I'm going back to Santa Monica, New York to L.A.
Never coming back, boy, no matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change,
I'm so afraid

We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car,
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough

You should never come between a woman and her dream
And a man who never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came

So, I'm going back to Santa Monica, New York to L.A.
Never coming back, boy, no matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart
Boy, I thought that I could make you change,
But I'm so afraid

And it's not love, it's just the fear
You've put down for all these years
But I'm leaving now

I'm going back to Santa Monica, New York to L.A.
Never coming back, boy, no matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change,
But I'm so afraid

Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I am done being afraid
