Lyrics:


[Shawn & Camila:]
Ah
Hey-ey
Ah, ah
Ah
Hey-ey
Ah, ah

[Camila:]
He knows
Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killing me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows

[Shawn (Camila):]
It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away (I'm slipping away)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone (the pictures on my phone)
She's not coming home (I'm not coming home)
(Coming home, coming home)

[Shawn (Camila):]
I know what you did last summer (ah-ah)
Just lie to me there's no other (he-ey)
I know what you did last summer
[Shawn & Camila:]
Tell me where you've been
[Shawn (Camila):]
I know what you did last summer (ah-ah)
Look me in the eyes, my lover (he-ey)
I know what you did last summer
[Shawn & Camila:]
Tell me where you've been

[Camila:]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
[Shawn:]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
[Camila:]
I didn't mean it, no
I didn't mean it, mean it, no
[Shawn:]
Can't seem to let you go
Can't seem to hold you close
I know

[Shawn:]
When she looks me in the eyes
They don't seem as bright
No more, no more, I know
That she loved me at one time
Would I promise her that night
Cross my heart and hope to die

[Shawn (Camila):]
It's tearing me apart (it's tearing me apart)
And she's slipping away (I'm slipping away)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone (the pictures on my phone)
And she's not coming home (I'm not coming home)
Oh, na, na, na, oh, yeah

[Shawn (Camila):]
I know what you did last summer (ah-ah)
Just lie to me there's no other (he-ey)
I know what you did last summer
[Shawn & Camila:]
Tell me where you've been
[Shawn (Camila):]
I know what you did last summer (ah-ah)
Look me in the eyes, my lover (he-ey)
I know what you did last summer
[Shawn & Camila:]
Tell me where you've been

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (no, no, no)

[Shawn (Camila):]
Can't seem to let you go,
Can't seem to keep you close
(hold me close)
I can't seem to let you go,
I can't seem to keep you close
(you know I didn't mean it though)

Tell me where you've been lately
Tell me where you've been lately
(just hold me close)
Tell me where you've been lately
Tell me where you've been lately
(don't, don't, don't, don't let me go)

I can't seem to keep you close,
I can't seem to let you go
(I didn't mean it, though)
I know you didn't mean it though
I know you didn't mean it though
(I don't wanna let you go)

Tell me you didn't mean it, though (no, no, no)
Tell me you didn't mean it, though
(can't seem to let you go, seem to let you go)
I know you didn't mean it, though
I wanna know you need it, though
(hold me close)
I know you didn't mean it, though
(just hold me close)
I know you didn't mean it, though

[Shawn & Camila:]
I can't seem to let you go,
Can't seem to hold you close

[Shawn (Camila):]
I know what you did last summer (ah-ah)
Just lie to me there's no other (he-ey)
I know what you did last summer
[Shawn & Camila:]
Tell me where you've been
[Shawn (Camila):]
I know what you did last summer (ah-ah)
Look me in the eyes, my lover (he-ey)
I know what you did last summer
[Shawn & Camila:]
Tell me where you've been

[Shawn & Camila:]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (ah-ah, he-ey)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (ah-ah, ah-ah)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (ah-ah, he-ey)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (ah-ah, ah-ah)
I know
