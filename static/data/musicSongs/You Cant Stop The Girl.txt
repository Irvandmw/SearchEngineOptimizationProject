Lyrics:


Oh, they're trynna shoot down angels
They're trynna pull their wings off
So they can't fly
And oh, but she's so brave though
Just like a tornado
She's taking us by storm

You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh
You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh
You can't stop the girl

They're trynna take our voices
They're trynna make our choices
So we scream loud, loud, loud
And oh, I know you feel the lightning
And it's so exciting, so here we go

You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh
You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh
You can't stop the girl

You can't stop the girl
You can't stop the girl
No you can't stop the girl

Oh, I know you feel the lightning
And it's so exciting, so here we come

(That's good enough for right now)
