Lyrics:


There's a bar room down the street
Where we meet
Where we pick up girls and take 'em dancing

If the shadows here could talk
Man, I'd walk
But she tells me
"Hon, don't give it another thought"

(That's what)

It's alright
Dance all night
We're never gonna see the morning light
That's what she said
(You'll never see it baby) That's what she said
That's what she said
(You'll never see it baby) That's what she said

There's a bar room down the street
Where we meet
Where we pick up girls and take 'em dancing

If the shadows here could talk
Man, I'd walk
But she tells me
"Hon, don't give it another thought"
(Yeah)
(Do you know that?)

It's alright
Dance all night
We're never gonna see the morning light
That's what she said
(Oh yeah)

That's what she said
Yeah
That's what she said
Ah yeah... yeah...
Morning light
That's what she said
Ah yeah... yeah...
We'll be alright
Yeah

It's alright
Dance all night
We're never gonna see the morning light
It's alright
Dance all night
We're never gonna see the morning light

That's what she said
That's what she said
Yeah... yeah...
We'll be alright
That's what she said
Ah yeah... yeah... yeah...
The morning light
That's what she said
Yeah... yeah...
We'll be alright
That's what she said
Yeah... yeah...
Morning light
What she said
