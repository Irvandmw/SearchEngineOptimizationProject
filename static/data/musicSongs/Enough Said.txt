[Drake]
Went from my nigga serving it by the tele
To venues in Manchester just swerving with Balotelli
The fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shitâs embarrassinâ
They even bring up these niggas make the comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ainât got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas Iâd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Donât you ever wake up disgusted?
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And peopleâs feelings have changed ever since I became somethinâ
Girls that becoming ladies
And my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city
This shit is crazy
And I donât know if speaking on it helps
This the shit thatâs on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know

Canât you talk to me
Lets talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(Yea wassup)

Came too far to give up
Gotta try, cause I canât do it on my own
Canât you talk to me
Tell me what you need
Canât you talk to me
Tell me what you need
