Lyrics:


This was a church
A house full of prayer
It ain't that now
I could tear it down
There's thieves at the altar
A snake wears the crown
Handing you coal
Swearing it's gold

Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn river to blood
The saviors come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine

I'd turn things around
I would if I could
Crash through the gates
Break every chain
Jail for the jailers
Sing freedoms song
Amazing grace
Burn down this place

Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn river to blood
The saviors come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine

Look what they've done to this house of love
Look what they've done to this house of love
The devil's in the temple and he's making a mess
Got the Mona Lisa, got his hands up her dress
The gun is in his hand but he ain't gonna confess
He lies

Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn river to blood
The saviors come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
