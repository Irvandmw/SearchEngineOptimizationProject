Lyrics:


Don't close your eyes, dear, don't you be nervous
You put this hold damn place in a spell
I see your friends here, and some of them jealous
'Cause they know this love don't come off the shelf

I saw your mother, she looks so beautiful
Remember when she didn't think I would stay?
But all of those late-night, broke-as-hell dinners
Led us to where we're standing today

I'm feeling time move slow
I'm seeing faces glow
None of them shine as bright
As you tonight
I'm hearing voices hush
There's no one else but us
Darling, there's so much love
Under these lights
If it's okay, let's just have the time
Of our lives

I saw your father, he wouldn't talk to me
Till he could tell that I was here to stay
But all of those awkward short conversations
Led us to where we're standing today

I'm feeling time move slow
I'm seeing faces glow
None of them shine as bright
As you tonight
I'm hearing voices hush
There's no one else but us
Darling, there's so much love
Under these lights
If it's okay, let's just have the time
Of our lives

Time of our lives
Time of our lives
Time of our lives

I'm feeling time move slow
I'm seeing faces glow
None of them shine as bright
As you tonight
I'm hearing voices hush
There's no one else but us
Darling, there's so much love
Under these lights
If it's okay, let's just have the time
Let's just have the time
Of our lives
