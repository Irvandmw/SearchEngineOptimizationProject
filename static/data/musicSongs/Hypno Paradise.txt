Lyrics:


All U can hear is the sound of my voice
Every time I touch your face
U gonna fall into a deep sleep
A deep sleep
A deep sleep

U are the reason I believe that I was born
U're always there 2 hold me whenever I am scorned
I'd give my left hand just 2 know your name
Shall I call U "Savior" just the same?

[Chorus:]
Hypno paradise, oh-oh-oh
Hypno paradise, oh-oh-oh

Am I in heaven or hypno paradise?
This must be heaven cuz hell was never nice
I don't need permission 2 be happy every day
As long as I got a freak like U, I'm straight

[Chorus]

Oh paradise

Touch me I'll go under any spell U choose
I don't mind the loss my dear, when it comes 2 U, I'll lose
I can dig them all 2 be wrong as long as U're all right
This is my destiny â hypno paradise
Paradise (So nice)

(Oh yes)
(Say U wanna get it on)
(Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, yeah yeah yeah)

(Oh yes)
(Say U wanna get it on)
(Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, yeah yeah yeah)

U are the reason that I was born
U're always there baby when I am scorned
I'd give my left hand, just 2 know your name
My Savior, every day, yeah ooh

(Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes)
(Come on, come on)
(Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes)

Hyp-no paradise
Hyp-no paradise
Hyp-no paradise
Hyp-no paradise

(Oh yes)
(Say U wanna get it on)
(Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, yeah yeah yeah)
