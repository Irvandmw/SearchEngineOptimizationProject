Song Name: If You Never Come To Me
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


There's no use of a moonlight glow or the peaks where winter snows
What's the use of the waves that break in the cool of the evening
What is the evening without you, it's nothing
It may be you will never come, if you never come to me
What's the use of my wonderful dreams, and why would they need me
Where would they lead me without you?  To nowhere
What's the use of my wonderful dreams, and why would they need me
Where would they lead me without you?  To nowhere.
