Lyrics:


When did I lose my voice?
When did I make the choice to be
living so easy in the quiet?
Too much of restless thinking
But they say time is everything.
You came and opened up the silence.

So I lie awake,
writing symphonies trapped inside me,
But now I know, what you give to me,
I'm living with the poet's heart, heart

Now all the lights turned on and I'm never gonna stop
As the words come out, it's because you lit the spark.
You're a priceless, timeless, precious work of art.
Though everywhere you are,
I'm living with the poet's heart.

Whisper to me again
You (fall) from my ears straight to my pen,
How did you see right through?
It's like you're always new.

So I lie awake
writing symphonies, you awoken me
Cause now I know, what you sing to me,
I'm living with the poet's heart, heart.

Then all the lights turned on and I'm never gonna stop
And as the words come out, it's because you lit the spark.
You're a priceless, timeless, precious work of art.
Though everywhere you are,
I'm living with the poet's heart

Oh, oh
So let's lie awake, making history
Yeah, you and me
Cause now we know,
so won't you sing to me,
our melody,
yeah

Now all the lights turned on and I'm never gonna stop
As the words come out, it's because you lit the spark.
You're a priceless, timeless, precious work of art.
Though everywhere you are,
I'm living with the poet's heart, heart, heart, heart

Now my feet won't touch the ground,
Yeah, we're flying high homeward bound
Take my hand, yeah, just like that.
We'll keep riding, riding
Don't look back, don't look back,
no, no...
