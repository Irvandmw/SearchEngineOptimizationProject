Lyrics:


I just canât get it together now without you baby
Oh I just canât reach to heaven without you yeah

Oh how can I miss your kissing night and days
Oh tell me baby
All I thought I had to do was get off and run baby run
How can I? How come a feelingâs feelinâ no desire tell me baby 
All all I had to do was find somebody oh a little sweeter than you

But I just canât get it together baby without you yeah
Oh I just canât reach to heaven now no no no no without you yeah

Oh how can I miss your kisses night and days tell me baby
All I thought I had to do was get off and run baby run

But I just canât get it together baby oh no without you yeah
Oh I just canât reach to heaven without you yeah
