Lyrics:


Brothers fighting brothers
Lovers fighting lovers
People barely caring anymore
Nations hating nations
Love is lost in the equation
Wondering why there is still so many wars

It's like this whole world's caught in
Some crazy storm

[Chorus:]
We could use some divine intervention
God, if you're listening, won't you help us
Find a solution to all this confusion

Lives in desperation
A world of devastation
No one knowing where it's gonna go
We got too many too hungry
It's time to stop this suffering
And I do not think we can do it on our own

And right now we need something
To save our souls

[Chorus:]
We could use some divine intervention
God, if you're listening, will not you help us
Find a solution to all this confusion (we sure could use some)

[Bridge:]
Show us that our change is gonna come
Help us to replace the hate with love
Our hearts overflow with kindness
Help us lift the clouds out of our way

We could use some divine intervention
God, if you're listening, will not you help us (yes, God are you listening)
Find a solution to all this confusion

Gotta find a way [x5]

God, if you're listening, will not you help us?
