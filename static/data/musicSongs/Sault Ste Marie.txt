Lyrics:


I fell in love in Sault Ste. Marie
My every dream came true the moment you walked by
These stars above I held you to me
And we kissed 'til the dawn touched the sky

We said adieu in Sault Ste. Marie
And though we had to part I left my heart with you
So my love wait for me
And I'll come back to you in Sault Ste. Marie

So my love wait for me
And I'll come back to you in Sault Ste. Marie
