Lyrics:


They say we're losers and we're all alright with that
We are the leaders of the not coming backs
But we're alright though
Yeah we're alright though

My girlfriend's bitchin' 'cause I always sleep in
She's always screaming when she's calling a friend
She's kinda hot though
Yeah she's kinda hot though
(Just a little bit hot)

My shrink is telling me I got crazy dreams
She's also saying I got low self-esteem
She's kinda hot though
Yeah she's kinda hot though
(Just a little bit a little bit hot)
She put me on meds, she won't get out of my head
She's kinda hot though

My friend left college 'cause it felt like a job
His mom and dad both think he's a slob
He's got a shot though 
Yeah, he's got a shot though 
When you've got bigger plans that no one else understands
You've got a shot though 

They say we're losers and we're alright with that
We are the leaders of the not-coming-back's
So we're alright though
Yeah we're alright though
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Yeah we're alright though 

Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm going insane
My neighbor told me that I got bad brains
But I'm alright though (We're alright though)
Yeah we're alright though (We're alright though)
'Cause we're the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
But we're alright though (We're alright though)
(One, two, three, four)

They say we're losers and we're alright with that
We are the leaders of the not-coming-back's
So we're alright though (We're alright though)
Yeah we're alright though (We're alright though)
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
But we're alright though 

Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na na na
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Yeah we're alright though
