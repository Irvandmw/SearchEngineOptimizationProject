Lyrics:


Yesterday's gone
I got a new head on today
I'm feeling much stronger
No one's getting in my way
But I won't waste no time
Not being without you
So I'll take all your time
And I'll take all your love
Out the door

The tears are all gone
I'm feeling closer and closer to you
What's pulling me down
I'm rising up so I can see you
But I won't, I won't waste no time
Not being without you
And I'm gonna take all your time
And I'll take all your love
Out the door

'Cause you make me feel
Like the only girl, the only one
You make it seem
Like my world's just begun
You can have everything
I just think it's me plus you
Yeah, you know that I do
I'll take all your time
And I'll take all your love
Out the door

Yeah
I will rise
I will fall
Better catch me through it all
I know you will
It's like you've always done before
That's why I'll take all your time
And I'll
I'll take all your love

'Cause you make me feel
Like the only girl, the only one
You make it seem
Like my world's just begun
You can have everything
I just think it's me plus you
Yeah, you know that I do
I'll take all your time
And I'll take all your love
Out the door
