Lyrics:


Take a seat and just listen up
'Cause this rhyme and reason done too much
I'm a dime a dozen thrown to sea,
You'll have to wait and see

You can have all of your outbreaks
If you let me make my own mistakes
I lie awake in my own head

Because of you, I'm gone for good, and that's the truth
Because of you, I'm gone for good. I'll be brand new
You can break me down, just like you did before
Because of you, I'm gone for good, and that's me over and out

I hear the sirens at the door
They're always coming back for more
I'm left with pockets of regret,
Swear I won't forget

The tragedy of success is
Believing in second chances
I lie awake in my own head (whoa)

Because of you, I'm gone for good, and that's the truth
Because of you, I'm gone for good. I'll be brand new
You can break me down just like you did before
Because of you, I'm gone for good, and that's me over and out

That's me over and out

So take me as I am, take me for everything
Replacing who I am with who I'd rather be
So take me as I am, take me for everything
Replacing who I am...

Because of you, I'm gone for good, and that's the truth
Because of you, I'm gone for good. I'll be brand new
You can break me down just like you did before
Because of you, I'm gone for good, and that's me over and out

That's me over and out
That's me over and out
