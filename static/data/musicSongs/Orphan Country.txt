Lyrics:


As a baby I was alone in my roller
Every sign rang the chord of dishonor
Oh I tried to see if I could find the light amid the dusk
But my kin can't love
And the others thirst for blood

Life and I growing older
I'm an orphan country to my home
Oh ask me why I stay
I say I know no other place
But my kin can't love
And the others thirst for blood

You can't pin me down
Run me wild as I am
Was the child
Wild horse should be left to run
Leave me to run
A little while
Leave me to run

My sister sits alone by the radio
I should hear something I don't
There's a door I can't open
A feeling I can't prize
So my kin still can't love
And the others thirst for blood

You can't pin me down
Run me wild as I am
Was the child
Wild horse should be left to run
Leave me to run
A little while
Leave me to run

Oh yeah
You can't pin me down
Run me wild as I am
Was the child
You can't pin me down
Run me wild as I am
Was the child
Wild horse should be left to run
Leave me to run
A little while
Leave me to run
Leave me to run
Leave me to run
A little while
Leave me to run
