Lyrics:


She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air 

Angel eyes
Rays of hope that hypnotise
They're a blessing in disguise
Lightning up my life 

We can play
in our secret hideaway
We can go there everyday
Time is on our side 

[Chorus:] She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air 

Angel eyes
There will be no compromise
now that I have realised
what they mean to me
Oh year... 

[Chorus:]
She blinded me... 

She brought heaven to me
just like a symphony 
The way she talks like an angel
A language out of this world 

I'm not a superstitious mind
not the spiritual kind
But she became a revalation to me
She made me believe 

[Outro:]
She's the sun that makes the rainbow
She's the blue sky when it's cloudy in my mind
She's the thunder, she's the lightning
She's the weather that keeps blowing troughout time
