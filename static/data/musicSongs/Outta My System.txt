Lyrics:


I try to brush it off
Keep calm and collected but it just won't work
They tell me "Read a book
Learn to cook, anything to keep your mind off her!"

And now I'm so-o
Tired of feeling so low-ow
Seven weeks in a row-ow
I don't wanna hear about
Don't wanna think about you

I wanna make out with the perfect stranger
Get loud need a mind eraser
Drink up tonight I'm on a mission
To get you outta my system
Downtown I'll be up all night
Get lost in the flash of lights
Drink up tonight I'm on a mission
To get you outta my system

I try to be mature
Stay polite but I'm really thinking what's it worth
When deep inside of me
I can't breathe I'm a victim of a love sick curse

And now I'm so-o
Tired of taking it slow-ow
Seven weeks in a row-ow
I don't wanna hear about
Don't wanna think about you

I wanna make out with the perfect stranger
Get loud need a mind eraser
Drink up tonight I'm on a mission
To get you outta my system
Downtown I'll be up all night
Get lost in the flash of lights
Drink up tonight I'm on a mission
To get you outta my system

Outta my system
Outta my system
Outta my system

It's been so long since I've been myself
Talking like, walking like someone else
Feels so good to get back to me
Rid myself of this misery
Now I'm here coming back to life
Turning my wrongs all back to right
I was way down, I was locked up
Now I'm free

I'm gonna make out with the perfect stranger
Get loud need a mind eraser
Drink up tonight I'm on a mission
To get you outta my system
Downtown I'll be up all night
Get lost in the flash of lights
Drink up tonight I'm on a mission
To get you outta my system

Oh, oh outta my system
Oh, oh outta my system
Outta my system
