Lyrics:


It feels like a dream 
How did things all get so crazy? 
Iâm remembering 
Before, when I felt so clean 

Alone in my room 
It feels like the walls are closing in 
Iâm thinking of you 
âCause I know whatâll happen soon 

Iâm spinning, out of control 
Not knowing which way to go 
Feelinâ left out in the cold 

I just wanna let go of it all 
And climb up over the wall 
I need some help to get back on my feet 
If youâre out there, cover me 

You thought you could come and take it all 
Without hurting me 
That was your biggest mistake 
Should have known when you saw me break! 
Alone in my room (I sit) 
And pray that the walls stop closinâ in 
And every breath I takeâs 
A step further away from the end of me 

I wanna get this off my mind 
Thereâs no one else I can tell... 
Please listen to me... 

In a world where confusion is only an illusion 
And fear itself, is just another 
Weak-minded solution 
I live in a generation with too much information 
Instead of bonding together 
We bring anger to the nation 
My faith is the only thing Iâve got 
And no one can take that from me
