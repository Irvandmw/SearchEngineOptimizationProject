Lyrics:


Don't breath, don't look down, don't cry
Don't waste your words and your time asking why
I can feel it in your touch, what will become of us

Feel the grass, hear the breeze, feel the doom
Watch the sun come up on me and you
Is this the last goodbye in love, what will become of us

I would run to you, if you'd walk with me
I would hear you out, if your heart would speak
I would die for you, if you'd live with me
What will become of us

Kiss me slow, drag it out, make it last
Give me something I don't have to give you back
Pretend we are the way it was
What will become of us

I would run to you, if you'd walk with me
I would hear you out, if your heart would speak
I would die for you, if you'd live with me
What will become of us

It's a lonely fall, it's a sink or swim
Can't see the rocks but we're diving in
I'll turn my head, while you twist your knife
turn the water red

Don't breathe, don't look down, don't cry
I'll look you through the river in your eyes
This is the last goodbye in love, end of
What will become of us
What will become of us
