Lyrics:


Now it seems Iâm fading
All my dreams are not worth saving
Iâve done my share of waiting
And Iâve still got nowhere else to go
So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Seems youâre wanting me to stay
But my dreams would surely waste away
And I still have nowhere else to go
So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Now it seems youâre leaving
But weâve only just begun
And youâve still got nowhere else to go
So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

And Iâve been waiting so long
And Iâve been waiting so long
And Iâve been waiting so long

So I wait for you to
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

And Iâve been waiting so long
And Iâve been waiting so long
And Iâve been waiting so long

So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way
