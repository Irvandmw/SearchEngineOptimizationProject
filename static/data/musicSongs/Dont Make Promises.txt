Song Name: Don't Make Promises
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


It seems the songs we're singing are all about tomorrow
Tunes of promises you can't keep
Every moment bringing the love I can only borrow
Telling me lies in your sleep

Do you think I'm not aware of what you're sayin'
Or why you're sayin' it
Is it hard to keep me where you want me stayin'
Don't go on betrayin'
Don't make promises you can't keep

We had a chance to find it
Our time was now or never
You promised me things
That I need
But then the things behind it
Took away the chance forever
You're telling me lies in your sleep

Do you think I'm not aware of what you're sayin'
Or why you're sayin' it
Is it hard to keep me where you want me stayin'
Don't go on betrayin'
Don't make promises you can't keep
Don't make promises you can't keep
Don't make promises you can't keep
