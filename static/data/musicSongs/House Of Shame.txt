Lyrics:


First you say you needed me,
then you give me sympathy,
they say good girls never win,
something good in giving in
how do I get through to you?
You must be made of stone.

Just when I was safe and sound
Love you built a wall around
You take a hard line attitude
Time to send me back to school
Or take me, take me to your
house of shame,
easy on your body when you got no name.

Hold me like you know me,
I'm a falling star,
catch me if you can,
show me the way inside.

You can knock on any door
I know what I'm looking for
Red light, hit and run
Time to turn the engine on
Pretty girl lives all alone
I must be goin' home.

Hot as hell and cold as ice
Everything I sacrifice
I got to pick up on what you do
I just can't get over you
You take me, take me to your
house of shame,
easy on your body when you got no name.

Hold me like you know me,
I'm a falling star,
catch me if you can,
show me the way inside.

Tell me what you really want from life,
loving you darling,
you got me infatuated,
good love is not for sale,
I nearly gave myself away.

Pretty girl lives all alone,
take me to your, take me to your
house of shame,
easy on your body when you got no name.

Hold me like you know me,
I'm a falling star,
catch me if you can,
show me the way inside.

House of Shame
Easy on the body when you've got no name

Hold me like you know me
I'm a falling star
Catch me if you can
Show me the way inside
