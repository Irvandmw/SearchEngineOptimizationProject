Lyrics:


Low, another night at the bar 'cause I just can't deal with it
Low, judging everyone else like a goddamn hypocrite
Low, used to love living life now I'm just so sick of it
Low, low, low, low, low, lo-oh-oh, oh-ow
Low, when she just broke my heart and I see her everywhere
Low, and I talk to myself 'cause I know nobody's there
Low, I got death at my door knocking, I'm not even scared
Low, low, low, low, low, lo-oh-oh, oh-ow

I haven't felt high in such a while
Been such a long time since I could smile
Just keep your distance
Don't need assistance, no
Low, low, low, low, lo-oh-oh, oh-ow

Low, well I'm trying my best but I'm just not good enough
Low, and I do stupid shit that I know I shouldn't have
Low, I can fuck but I think I'm incapable of love
Low, low, low, low, low, lo-oh-oh, oh-ow

I haven't felt high in such a while
Been such a long time since I could smile
Just keep your distance
Don't need assistance, no
Low, low, low, low, lo-oh-oh, oh-ow

Never been so low
Never been so low
(Low, low, low, I've never been so low)
Never been so low
Never been so low
(Low, low, low, I've never been so low)
Never been so low
Never been so low
(Low, low, low, I've never been so low)
Low, low, low, low, lo-oh-oh, oh-ow

I haven't felt high in such a while
Been such a long time since I could smile
Just keep your distance
Don't need assistance, no
Low, low, low, low, lo-oh-oh, oh-ow

I haven't felt high in such a while
Been such a long time since I could smile
Just keep your distance
Don't need assistance, no
Low, low, low, low, lo-oh-oh, oh-ow
