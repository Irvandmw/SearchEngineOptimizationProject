Lyrics:


It's winter-fall
Red skies are gleaming
Sea-gulls are flying over
Swans are floatin' by
Smoking chimney-tops

Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky
Children are fantasising
Grown-ups are standin' by
What a super feeling

Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

(Dreaming)
So quiet and peaceful
Tranquil and blissful
There's a kind of magic in the air
What a truly magnificent view
A breathtaking scene

With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand

(Dreaming)
A cosy fireside chat
A little this, a little that
Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
Gentle rain beatin' on my face
What an extraordinary place!

And the dream of the child
Is the hope of theâhope of the man

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky
Mountains are zoomin' higher
Little girls scream and cry

My world is spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin'
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling

Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Ooh, it's bliss.
