Lyrics:


Ooh baby when you, call me I come to
From dreams I awake, and I'm waiting for you 
Ooh baby when you, call me I come to
I jump through hula-hoops of fire just to get to you

You're making me crazy
Ooh little baby
Shut your complaining
Why-aye-aye-aye

You make me so angry
Someone should pay me
Why don't you get the sty-y-y-yle
Make me smile

Life's been killing me
But I willingly go
You're kidding me
Why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me
Won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me
Won't stop bleeding my soul

You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

Ooh honey when you, call me I want to
Stay on the telephone for hours just to getcha home
Ooh sugar when you, call me after school
I see your smile and I could run a methamphetamile

I'll never forget it, oh you'll regret it
Nowhere to kiss it
Lick it or leave it
Better believe it
You'll never see it, why-y-y-y say goodbye?

Life's been killing me
But I willingly go
You're kidding me
Why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me
Won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me
Won't stop bleeding my soul

(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
You know I go the distance
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
The path of least resistance

New kind of porno
One that has yet been born, oh

Loving you is like loving a
Hurricane, I'm tired of
All the mess you make
All the hearts you break

Loving you is like loving a
Dirty bomb, you're blowing up
All the cash I'm paid
All the love we made

Life's been killing me
But I willingly go
You're kidding me
Why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me
Won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me
Won't stop bleeding my soul

Life's been killing me
(Keep killing me)
But I willingly go
(And I willing go)
You're kidding me
(You're kidding me)
Why keep leading me on?
(Why keep leading me on?)
Keep killing me
(Stop stealing my heart)
Won't stop stealing my heart
(Stop bleeding my soul)
Keep killing me
(You know I'll go, you know I'll go)
Won't stop bleeding my soul

(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
You know I go the distance
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
The path of least resistance
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Your problem with commitment's
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
The bane of my existence

True love, it comes once
You messed it up, you stupid
