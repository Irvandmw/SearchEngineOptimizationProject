Lyrics:


(Don't believe all those lies)
Darling just believe your eyes and

Look look my heart is an open book
I love nobody but you
Look look my heart is an open book
My love is honest and true

Some jealous so-and-so wants us to part
That's why he's telling you that I've got a cheating heart
Don't believe all those lies darling just believe your eyes
And look look my heart is an open book
I love nobody but you

Some jealous so-and-so...
Nobody but you nobody but you
