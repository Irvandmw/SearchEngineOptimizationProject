Lyrics:


My face is scarred
And Iâm seldom lucky
And the words that He gave to me then
Much later touched me

And He was pushed but He wouldnât push back
And He was fought but not bested
And He believes now so much more than He did yesteryear
And He wonât be bested, He wonât be bested, oh no

Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
Give me hope to try
And I wonât walk on by

Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
And I wonât walk on by

Love is never as easy to come as we think it should be
But when it does donât it pour down like the rain

And I wonât be pushed
Wonât be chained
Wonât be lost
And I wonât be afraid

Thatâs just not as easy as it should seem
So, please

Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
Give me hope to try
I wonât walk on by

Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
Give me hope and Iâm going to try
I wonât walk on by
