Lyrics:


They're tryin' to run off with my drip
I'm tryin' to send a couple pounds to my bitch, now
I try to play Mr. Nice Guy
But fuck my other plug, I'm hoppin' the fence
I got my weight up
I'm menace bitch, I'm doing push ups like Fifty
I got on a bandana like 2Pac
And going going back to Cali like Biggie, huh

I've got them bows for the low
Pull up and shove like a stove
Stand on his hill, that's a forty
And when that bitch up it's gonna blow
My lil bitch do my Glock and my nine
My lil bitch don't be talkin' to lames
I be like B give me a head
My bitch put her box on my name
My bitch gonna give me another
Matter fact, get two more bring my brother
And we in a house on the hill
I'm tryin' to save up get another one
We 'bout whatever you know that
The pack ain't [?] no throwback
Fuck all that talkin' for, show that
I'm in this bitch bopin' like Kodak
Check my Rolie make 'em dizzy
Bitches on me, pretty Ricky
Take your hoe and bring her with me
She suck my dick, she left a hicky
I'm bopin', sprintin' like Diddy
My feet don't touch the ground I'm floatin'
I'm the type to hurt your feelin's
Take your bitch and bust her open

They're tryin' to run off with my drip
I'm tryin' to send a couple pounds to my bitch, now
I try to play Mr. Nice Guy
But fuck my other plug, I'm hoppin' the fence
I got my weight up
I'm menace bitch, I'm doing push ups like Fifty
I got on a bandana like 2Pac
And going going back to Cali like Biggie, huh
