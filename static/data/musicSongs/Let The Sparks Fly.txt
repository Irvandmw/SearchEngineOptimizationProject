Lyrics:


Let the sparks fly

There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it
Give me three signs that you're awake
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it
Give me three signs that you're awake
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away

Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
'Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

Give me one good reason
Two more to believe in
And three shots at why I should wait
'Cause I got one more match
Two strikes left
You got to three to get out of my way

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it
Give me three signs that you're awake
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away

Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
'Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

Let the sparks fly baby

Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
'Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
'Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
'Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby
