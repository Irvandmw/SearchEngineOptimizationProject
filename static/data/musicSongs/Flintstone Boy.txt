Lyrics:


Please don't talk about the Flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't talk about the Flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't worry about the Flintstone boy
He got trouble but he ain't got joy
Please don't talk about the Flintstone boy
Please don't talk about the Flintstone boy
Don't you worry, he's alright with me, oh yeah, oh yeah

Please don't worry about the Flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't worry about the Flintstone boy
He's alright with me
Please don't talk about the Flintstone boy

He got trouble and he ain't got joy
Please don't worry about the Flintstone boy
Please don't worry about the Flintstone boy
Don't you worry, he's alright with me, oh yeah, oh yeah
