Lyrics:


Only one life to live in
We're trying our best to make it through
There's no mistakes just lessons
It's all about what they mean to you

No matter what you've gone through you can
Pick up the pieces move on with your life
We had to accept the wrongs and try to make them right
It may be hard to look at yourself and see the truth
You've got to realize it takes time to become you

[Chorus]
So just get to moving' on
We're movin' on
We're movin' on
Living day by day everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same
Movin' on

Take what you've been given
Gotta take a chance while we can
To find our place in our world
We had to understand the plan

Put the past behind you and
Pick up the pieces move on with your life
'cause we had to accept the wrongs and try to make them right
You can look at yourself and see the truth
Realize it takes time to become you

[Chorus]

We know we've changed
But we're still the same
Getting closer to what we're supposed to be
As life goes on you'll have your time
'cause everything's meant to be
Movin' on

Movin' on, movin' on
Everything must change
But we're still the same

[Chorus]
