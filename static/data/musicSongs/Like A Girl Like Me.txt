Lyrics:


Oh, six-feet-three and curly hair too
Makes a girl like me like a boy like you
Like a girl like me would like a boy like you
To like a girl like me

And if a girl like me can like a boy like you
Then a boy like you can like a girl like me
Like a girl like me would like a boy like you
To like a girl like me

Now you may be confused because
You can't make heads or tails of what I'm saying 
But if you'll just listen I will tell you now
I only want to let you know 
Just how I feel about you 
And this is the only way that I know how

So listen, six-feet-three and curly hair too
Makes a girl like me like a boy like you
Like a girl like me would like a boy like you
To like a girl like me

Now you may be confused because 
You can't make heads or tails of what I'm saying
But if you'll just listen I will tell you now
I only want to let you know
Just how I feel about you
And this is the only way that I know how

So listen, six-feet-three and curly hair too
Makes a girl like me like a boy like you
Like a girl like me would like a boy like you
To like a girl like me
