Lyrics:


[Intro]
You see a nigga soft, my first instinct is to lean on
A weak nigga eatinâ in my hood, niggasâll put a beam on âem
These niggas ain't supposed to be eatinâ yo
This sweet is sweet anâ low, Iâll have âem like shit was all good just a week ago

[Verse 1]
Let Drake get you niggas in the mood for love
Iâm back to get you in the mood for the snub and gloves
Dope fiend, morphine, cocaine dilemma
Crack come to cooking up that, boy Iâm a chemist
Fuck pill poppin, a strap I pop that
Watch the Henchman trial, see a rat rat on a rat
Got a nice gimmick going, youâve been hot a few summers
But I got the type of flow thatâll stop World hunger
SK, I got nothing but energy
Call me Fifty, call me Ferrari the remedy
Hi again in case a hater donât remember me
I happen to be what these rap niggas here pretend to be
Hittin you wonât be enough, you gotta finish me or itâs Ruger time
The SR9 fragments ricochet in ya ass go blind
Times up, ya fucked, gotta learn to duck, wassup

[Hook x2]
Donât make me (donât, d-d-donât)
Donât make me (do it)
Donât make me (you know I do it)
Show you whats up
Donât make me fuck you up

[Verse 2]
Listen any bitch on the milk box ain't missinâ
I mean some of these hoes running round with Pippen
Iâm writing reality it sounds harsh
Shyne (Sean?) try to get at me he sounds washed
I ain't even fire back the shits washed
What kind of shit is that, this only happens in rap
These niggas so fake, it make my skin crawl
Hope I ain't the last real nigga up over the wall
Ice chunks in the chain, weight spinnin, cream linen
Bulges from the Benjaminâs in âem
Tom Ford, oh Lord, if I ain't know better I think a nigga push raw
It feels like itâs never gon stop
A nigga so hot, I may spend forever on top
(Forever ever) Forever in the drop
Cant til I got it on lock
Bitch

[Hook]
