Lyrics:


Under the Surface
(Under the Surface)
Wires are crossed
(Wires are crossed)
At any moment
(At any moment)
I could go off!

And I can't hold much longer
It keeps getting stronger
It's only a matter of time!

I'm living like a landmine
Waiting to explode!
I'm ticking like a time-bomb
Ready to go!
I'm a danger to myself
And everybody else
I'm living like a landmine
Waiting to explode!
I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!

Under the pressure
(Under the pressure)
I'm not okay
(I'm not okay)
I live in denial
(I live in denial)
I bottle the rage

And I can't hold much longer
It keeps getting stronger
It's only a matter of time!

I'm living like a landmine
Waiting to explode!
I'm ticking like a time-bomb
Ready to go!
I'm a danger to myself
And everybody else
I'm living like a landmine
Waiting to explode!
I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!

I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!

And I can't hold much longer
It keeps getting stronger
It's only a matter of time!

I'm living like a landmine
Waiting to explode!
I'm ticking like a time-bomb
Ready to go!
I'm a danger to myself
And everybody else
I'm living like a landmine
Waiting to explode!

I'm living like a landmine
Waiting to explode!
I'm ticking like a time-bomb
Ready to go!
I'm a danger to myself
And everybody else
I'm living like a landmine
Waiting to explode!

I'm ready to go!
(I'm ready to go!)
(I'm ready to go!)
(I'm ready to go!)
I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!
I'm ready to go!
