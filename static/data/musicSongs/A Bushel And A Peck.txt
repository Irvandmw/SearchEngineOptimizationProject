Lyrics:


(Doodle oodle ooh doo, doodle oodle ooh doo,
Doodle oodle ooh doo, doo!)

What'cha doin' hutton?
Doodlin'... can you doodle?
Can I doodle? - I can't get it outta my noodle!

How come?

'Cause I love you a bushel an' a peck,
A bushel an' a peck and a hug around the neck (ouch!)
Hug around the neck and a barrel an' a heap,
Barrel an' a heap an' I'm talkin' in my sleep!
About you! (about me?) yes, about you!
My heart is leapin', havin' trouble sleepin'!
'cause I love you a bushel an' a peck,
You bet your purdy neck I do!

(Doodle oodle ooh doo, doodle oodle ooh doo,
Doodle oodle ooh doo, doo!)

Do you like me perry? oh very, do you like me hutton?
Like a glutton! so, where's your "como" button?
Oh! I love you a bushel an' a peck (how much?)
A bushel an' a peck though you make my heart a wreck!
Make my heart a wreck and you make my life a mess,
Make my life a mess, yes a mess of happiness!
About you! (about me?) yes, about you!

You're gonna grieve me, if an' you ever leave me!
'cause I love you a bushel an' a peck,
You bet your purdy neck I do!

(Doodle oodle ooh doo, doodle oodle ooh doo,
Doodle oodle ooh doo, doo!)

Heh heh, it's gettin' kinda quiet around here!
Oh! we can fix that perry boy! let's go!
I love you a bushel an' a peck,
A bushel an' a peck and it beats be all to heck,
Beats me all to heck how I'll ever tend the farm
Ever tend the farm when I wanna keep my arms about you!
About you, the cows an' chickens, let em go to the dickens
'cause I love you a bushel an' a peck,
You bet your purdy neck I do!

(Doodle oodle ooh doo, doodle oodle ooh doo,
Doodle oodle ooh doo, doo!)

...it's gettin' kinda quiet again!

(Doodle oodle ooh doo, doodle oodle ooh doo,
Doodle oodle ooh doo, doo!)

...an octave lower please!

(Doodle oodle ooh doo, doodle oodle ooh doo,
Doodle oodle ooh doo, doo!)
