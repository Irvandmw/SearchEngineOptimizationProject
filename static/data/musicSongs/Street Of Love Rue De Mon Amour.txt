Artist: Dean Martin Lyrics
Song Name: Street Of Love (Rue De Mon Amour)
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You can stroll along the avenues
Choose whichever one you care to choose
But your heart's a song when you stroll along
Rue de Mon Amour

All the lovers there you chance to meet
Seem to make this street their favorite street
Love gave it its name that's how it became
Rue de Mon Amour

I was just a stranger to Pareee
Maybe she was just a stranger too
As I walked along she walked with me
And we fell in love as strangers do

You may say that I am quite naive
But I must believe what I believe
Cupid led my feet to that lovely street
Rue de Mon Amour

You may say that I am quite naive
But I must believe what I believe
Cupid led my feet to that lovely street
Rue de Mon Amour
