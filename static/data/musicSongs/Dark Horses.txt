Lyrics:


Yeah

I made my mistakes
I seen my heart cave in
I got my scars
I been to hell and back again

Born for the blue skies
Weâll survive the rain
Born for the sunrise
Weâll survive the pain

[Chorus:]
Weâre singingâ¦
Hey, you canât count us out
Weâve been running up against the crowd
Yeah, we are the dark horses
Weâre singingâ¦
Wait! Itâs not over now
Weâve been down but weâve never been out
Yeah, we are the dark horses

We found the way out
The city takes everything it can
But outside the crowds
I can feel my lungs again

Born for the blue skies
Weâll survive the rain
Born for the sunrise
Weâll survive the pain

[Chorus]

We're singing
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la.

Yeah!

Born for the blue skies
Born for the blue skies
Born for the sunrise
Weâll survive the pain

[Chorus:]
Weâre singingâ¦
Hey, you canât count us out
Weâve been running up against the crowd
Yeah, we are the dark horses
Weâre singingâ¦
Wait, donât care what they say
We know weâll find a way
Yeah! We are the dark horses

Yeah!

Laa la-la-la-la-laa
Laa la-la-la-la-laa

[Faded Voice:]
Keep running with the dark horses
Hope makes the blood change courses
Keep running with the dark horses
Stand up with the dark horses
Keep running with the dark horses
Hope makes the blood change courses
