Lyrics:


She's tired of wanting somebody, oh
Want a real man and don't want a copy, oh
She want a little love and want to be my baby
She want to feel some love, she hadn't had none lately

Hit it up low key
Beat it up low key
Skin it up low key
Mmm
(She want me to) Hit it up low key
(She want me to) Beat it up low key
(She want me to) Skin it up low key
Mmm

How can you be so beautiful and a lonely woman?
How can you be so beautiful but nobody want ya?
Is it maybe because that your standards are high?
Is it because you don't want no regular guy?

Think of your heart and not your pocket, oh no
You say yourself, it's hard to stop it, oh no
Have you ever thought because maybe you're afraid of love?
Or all the above

She's tired of wanting somebody, oh
Want a real man and don't want a copy, oh
She want a little love and want to be my baby
She want to feel some love, she hadn't had none lately

Hit it up low key
Beat it up low key
Skin it up low key
Mmm
(She want me to) Hit it up low key
(She want me to) Beat it up low key
(She want me to) Skin it up low key
Mmm

Tell me girl, why you ain't got man already?
Give me that ting and I'll make sure we go steady
Take good care of you and treat you fairly
Remember to sing to you when you feel sexy

You will never let go, at least from me
Said, you will never let go, once you get on this dick
You gon' want to be loved, want to be loved right?
Tonight

She's tired of wanting somebody, oh
Want a real man and don't want a copy, oh
She want a little love and want to be my baby
She want to feel some love, she hadn't had none lately

Hit it up low key
Beat it up low key
Skin it up low key
Mmm
(She want me to) Hit it up low key
(She want me to) Beat it up low key
(She want me to) Skin it up low key (Go)
Mmm
