Lyrics:


With the help of vibration through tone and rhythm
The human is forgiven and the soul gets back to living
Returns us all to our natural condition
Turns up the levels on the mind's inner visions
It plays through the space to where you are
And regulates the beating of the broken hearts
A sensation in everybody's pants
Which is why when there is music, life becomes a dance

I take the music everywhere I go
I take the music everywhere I go

Motion is the nature of vibration
It contains a thought and feeling
A baby's first pleasure is to shake its hands and feet and move
And rock the body right
Proving that motion is a sign of life
Obey your body language
It's sending a message
That doesn't ever have to touch the tongue to be expressive
I'm an instrument the spirit gets to play
I sing and I dance all day

I take the music (Music)
Everywhere I go (I go, I go, I go)
I take the music (Music)
Everywhere I go (I go, I go)

Music is the quickest way to heaven
It's the source of all creation
Listening to music will change your DNA, son
Everybody got their own transmission
The frequency of thought will impact the magnetism
LOVE is all I need to be
The message that I'm sending is the same I'll be receiving
LOVE is what energizes me
There is love within the rhythm I am breathin'

I take the music (Music)
Everywhere I go (I go, I go, I go)
I take the music (Music)
Everywhere I go (I go, I go)
I take the music (Music)
Everywhere I go (I go, I go, I go)
I take the music (Music)
Everywhere I go (I go)

Music has no limitations
Everybody's welcome
From the whisper of the trees, to the elephant that's belting
Raising hell is every bat and every bee
Every cat and every creature has a song for me
We ain't man made
We all come from nature
Every one of us is a brother and a sister
One World
We're a family of One
Where even the smallest bird hums
Even the smallest bird

There is music in our voices
Even when no words are spoken
Our bodies can speak louder than when our mouths are open
There's an under riding common frequency
That keeps us all aligned in divine harmony
Any scale, any note, any style, any meter
Music is the reason that we love to burn the reefer
Put that on record and spin it around
You and I are high on sound

I take the music everywhere I go
I take the music everywhere I go
I take the music everywhere I go
(I take the music, I take the music)
I take the music (Music) everywhere I go (I go, I go)
Music it gives us

The power to move
The power to speak
The power to choose
The power to dream
The power to vote
The power to fly
The power to laugh
The power to cry

The power to live
The power to play
The power to take your breath away
The power to love
The power to be

I take my power with me (Power)
Everywhere I go (I go, I go, I go)
I take my power (Power)
Everywhere I go (I go, I go)

I take the music (Music)
Everywhere I go (I go, I go, I go)
I take the music (Music)
(I go, I go)

(Take the music, take the music)
(Take the music, take the music)
(Music)
(Take the music, take the music)
(Take the music, take the music)
