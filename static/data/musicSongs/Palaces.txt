Lyrics:


It could take a little
It could take a little time
But I think we'll get it right
This life is only
Only real life when it hurts
But I think that we'll survive
Survive

We built palaces
Imagining everything we want but can't have
Real life ain't so fantastic
But you and me, we could've had
Everything in our wildest dreams
Palaces are deceiving
We could've had it all without the price that we paid
We could've had it all without the chains
That palaces make

Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into love
Let's break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love

It could take a little
It could take a little time
But this life could be so blessed
If we keep it simple
Saying no to the madness
And I'll take care of the rest, the rest

We built palaces
Imagining everything we want but can't have
Real life ain't so fantastic
But you and me, we could've had
Everything in our wildest dreams
Palaces are deceiving

Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into love
Let's break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into love

We built palaces but palaces fade
But we still say
We built palaces
Imagining everything we want but can't have
Real life ain't so bad

Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into love
Let's break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into love, let's
Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into love, let's
Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into love
