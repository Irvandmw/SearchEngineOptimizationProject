Lyrics:


[Ed Sheeran]
And that I'll fight my corner,
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood turns into alcohol,
No, I just wanna hold ya.

Give a little time to me (give a little time to me)
We'll play hide and seek (we'll play hide and seek)
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love........

Love me, love me, love me, give me love, give me love!

[Mic Righteous]
As youth we used to play games 
like Hide and Seek and Simon Says 
and then we realized 
weâre not mice, weâre men
and that was kinda dead. 
For one more time, letâs play Simon Says
But this time, itâs not Simon, âcause Simonâs Ed
Give me love like it meant life or death
like it meant your final breathe, yeah, 
Give me love like you could buy it from the corner shop 
You could spend your time,
so it donât matter if youâre poor or not. 
Give me that real love
Something you could feel, love, 
Maybe it could heal ya 
Just like the first time you said it 
Give me love
âcause hate is the worst kind of weapon
Itâs like I finally see the person in my reflection.
