Lyrics:


Envious eyes watchin' me and you
They criticize everything we do
When they say our love is wild
When they put us down we'll smile and say
It's our own funny way, hey, hey
It's our own funny way

Most of the time they think we're doin' wrong
Is it a crime to wanna be alone
They don't like our ways and such
Still we love and care as much as they
In our own funny way, hey hey
In our own funny way, oh yeah

Let them say we don't belong
Hand in hand we'll prove they're wrong someday
In our own funny way, hey hey
In our funny way, oh yeah
