Lyrics:


You always looked a little out of place, all grown up with freckles on your face
We'd spend each night with company, just you, the teddy bear, the dolls and me
What a funny girl you used to be, you always had a thousand things to do
Getting all involved with something new, always some new recipe the kitchen
Always looked like World War Three, what a funny girl you used to be
It was so good with you around, you always found a smile
Where smiles could not be found, I never ever met a person more sincere
You'd always listen with an open ear, you'd fall for lines so easily
Whatever they were selling you'd buy three
What a funny girl you used to be, what a funny girl you used to be...
