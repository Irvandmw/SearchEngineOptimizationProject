Lyrics:


A wounded, sparrow
Timid and shy
A fallen deer, that's what they call me
But I'm an iron butterfly

A childish liar
A devilish bitch
I can be innocent and charming
And suddenly switch

But you've got to understand,
Understand, understand
That I've never belonged

I can be sweet
I can be wise
I've got everyone of you mirrored
In my deep, sad eyes

I know where you've been to
And who you're afraid to be
Cause nothing that is human
Is alien to me

I talk to strangers, strangers, strangers
One at a time

A wounded sparrow
Timid and shy
A fallen deer, that's what they call me
But I'm an iron butterfly

I know where you've been to
And who you're afraid to be
Cause nothing that is human
Is alien to me

I talk to strangers, strangers, strangers
One at a time
