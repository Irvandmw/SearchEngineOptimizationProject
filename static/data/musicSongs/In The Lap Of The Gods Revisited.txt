Lyrics:


It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky, but I gotta chance it
So funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo wo la la la
I can see what you want me to be
I'm no fool

No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and on
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong
You say I
(You can do it)
Can't 
(You can do it)
Set 
(You can go and set her free)
You free from me
But that's not true

It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo wo la la la oh
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Wo wo ooh
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Wo wo ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Wo wo ooh

It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Wo wo ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Wo wo ooh
