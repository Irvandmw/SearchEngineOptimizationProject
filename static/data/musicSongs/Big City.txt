Lyrics:


Alright you polaroids.. let's go!
(yeah.. yeah.. yeah..)
Mhh we're in the big city
Uh.. come on!

Where ever we are it's a big city
Dirty little hotel room or working on a farm
If everybody is a star - to me - you're the most pretty
I'm in da big city, da big city, da big city
When I'm in your arms

Bright Lights, a sea of faces
Something tells me this is gonna be fun
Tonight's the night
And of all the places
That I'm going to fall in love, it's got to be this one

There'll never be anybody happier than this
Let's make a vow and seal it with a kiss
(uh.. yeah)

Where ever we are it's a big city
Dirty little hotel room or working on a farm
If everybody is a star - to me - you're the most pretty
I'm in da big city, da big city, da big city
When I'm in your arms

It's our time - we're in the line for the big break
Everything is looking up when you're this low to the ground
It's bout time
Everybody's on the take
Let's get a big brush and paint this town

The night is young...
Much younger than we are
Let's kiss the night
Away in a fast car

Where ever we are it's a big city
Dirty little hotel room or working on a farm
If everybody is a star - to me - you're the most pretty
I'm in da big city (and me), da big city, da big city
When I'm in your arms

Everybody's getting money instead of getting saved
Not you and me honey we already gave
Just as long as eye got you don't care come what may...

(Well.. she's in da big city)

Eye just came to tell y'all
From the darkest desperation to the highest bliss
Power to the one's aware of the bigger than this!
Big city uh.. where's my guitar?
What's going on? everything good

Where ever we are it's a big city
Dirty little hotel room or working on a farm
If everybody is a star - to me - you're the most pretty
I'm in da big city, da big city, da big city
When I'm in your arms

The big city so pretty
Oh yeah
Taking back the lane give it to the next man, plane 
Foxy and you what you wanna do?
That's it.
