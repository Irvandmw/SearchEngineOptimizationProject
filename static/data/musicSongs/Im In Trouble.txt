Lyrics:


I told a lie, my guts are tight
I know I gotta come clean or I won't sleep tonight, yeah
I told a fib, just fell outta my lips
Don't wanna be that kid 'cause I was scared of something, oh

I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble) oh
I'm in trouble (you're in trouble) oh, oh
I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble) oh
I'm in trouble (you're in trouble)
I'm in trouble (you're in trouble)

Yeah, I told a lie, my guts are tight
I looked you straight in the eye and I could tell you know
I was on the spot but I gave it a shot
But I know you know, I know you know

I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble) oh
I'm in trouble (you're in trouble) oh, yeah, oh
I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble) oh
I'm in trouble (you're in trouble)
I'm in trouble (you're in trouble)

I'm begging you please, take pity on me
I know it was wrong, that lie just fell outta me, oh
I told a lie and I feel so mean
And so here I am trying to come clean

I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble) oh
I'm in trouble (you're in trouble) oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble) oh
Am I in trouble? (You're in trouble)
Am I in trouble? (You're in trouble)
Am I in trouble?
Am I in trouble?
