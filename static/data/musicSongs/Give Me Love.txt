Lyrics:


Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
I told you that I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call you
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold you

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

And that I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call you
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love

M-my, m-my, m-my, give me love, lover
M-my, m-my, m-my, give me love, lover
M-my, m-my, m-my, give me love, lover
M-my, m-my, m-my, give me love, lover

M-my, m-my, m-my, give me love, lover
M-my, m-my, m-my, give me love, lover
M-my, m-my, m-my, give me love, lover
M-my, m-my, m-my, give me love, lover

My, my, my, my, give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love

My, my, my, my, give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love
