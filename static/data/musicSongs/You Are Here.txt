Lyrics:


From Liverpool to Tokyo
What a way to go
From distant lands one woman one man
Let the four winds blow

Three thousand miles over the ocean
Three thousand light years from the land of the rising sun

Love has opened my eyes
Love has blown right through
Wherever you are, you are here

Three thousand miles over the ocean
Three thousand light years from the land of surprising sun
East is east and west is west
The twain shall meet
East is west and west is east
Let it be complete

Three thousand miles over the ocean
Three thousand light years from the land of the morning star
