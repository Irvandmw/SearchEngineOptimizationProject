Lyrics:


Donât play that song for me
âCause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you

Oh no! Donât let them play it (oh no!)
It fills my heart with pain (it hurts!)
Please stop it right away
âCause I remember just aâ what he said

He said, darling (darling I, I love you)
And I know that he lied (darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (you lied)
Lied (you lied)
You lied (to me)

Hey mister, donât play it no more
Donât play it no more
I canât stand it
Donât play it no more (no more)
No more (no more)
No more (canât stand it)

I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only seventeen
I never dreamed heâd be so mean

He told me darling (darling, I love you)
Baby, baby, you lied (darling, I need you)
You, you lied (darling, I love you)
You know that you lied (you lied)
Lied (you lied)
Lied, lied (to me)

O-o-oh darling (darling, I love you)
You know that you lied, yeah (darling, I need you)
You know I know you lied (darling, I love you)
Darling, you lied (you lied)
You lied (you lied)
You lied. Youâre all that I need. You lied  (to me)
O-u-o-o-o-oh, you lied (donât play it no more)
Hey baby donât play it no more (wo-o-oh, donât play it no more)
Donât do it. Donât play it no more (wo-o-oh, for me)
No more (for me)
I canât stand it no more (donât play it no more)
Ouh! Hey! Donât play it no more (wo-o-oh, donât play it no more)
