Lyrics:


Everynight I hope and pray, a dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms, and feel the magic of her charms
Because I want someone to call my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover where are you, with a love, oh so true
I need a hand that I can hold to feel you near as I grow old
Because I want someone to call my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Someday, I don't how, I hope she'll hear my plea
Someway, I don't know how, she'll bring her love to me

Dream lover until then, I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do, till all my lover dreams come true
Because I want someone to call my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
