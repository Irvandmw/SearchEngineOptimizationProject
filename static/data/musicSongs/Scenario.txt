Lyrics:


Three in the morning the pancake house
Four in the morning we be rolling to my house
Five in the morning the lights go out
Six in the morning you can hear us start to shout
Seven in the morning sheâll be callin'cab
Eight in the morning talking about the mush she had
Nine in the morning man she just gettin' home
Talkin' about the over night scenario, scenario
Three in the morning the pancake house
Four in the morning we be rolling to my house
Five in the morning the lights go out
Six in the morning you can hear us start to shout
Seven in the morning sheâll be callin'cab
Eight in the morning talking about the mush she had
Nine in the morning man she just gettin' home
Talkin' about the over night scenario, scenario

The way I blew up on the scene you think Osama did it
The way Iâm addressing DC you think Obama did it
This is for the ladies in the crowd, gettin' loud
My intelligent women, you dumb bitches ain't allowed
I'm reppin' DMV, so you know I'm proud
They gave me a license to kill and I'm doin' it right now
On the rise like DOW, with a Jones for this rap shit
At the ten headdin' for the zone watch me catch it
That VISA flow âcause Iâm accepted everywhere
Getting credit now beware, Iâm the tortoise you the hare
See I took my time to design this rhyme
Perfecting every synonym, every syllable slowly killinâ them
Why spit game when I could just get to drillin' them
I think Iâm going too fast, lets slow it down like Ritalin

Three in the morning the pancake house
Four in the morning we be rolling to my house
Five in the morning the lights go out
Six in the morning you can hear us start to shout
Seven in the morning sheâll be callin'cab
Eight in the morning talking about the mush she had
Nine in the morning man she just gettin' home
Talkin' about the over night scenario, scenario

Yeah, Iâm spittin' crack
Now Iâm marrying the game, burying these lames
Where Iâm from?âMarylandâs the name
Radio play is necessary in this game
See I dream of Danny Jones, playin' my demo at home
Get excited, call tigga, let him listen through the phone
But that ainât happening, so Iâm doing it on my own
If you think that you street, then meet me at the chili bowl
Or maybe hit the water front and we can really flow
You know Iâm really cold, tell your girl to bring the fur
After I beat ya, hit Ibiza and Iâm bringin' her
One in the am the club causin' mayham
My homie C Dot got two women tryin' to lay him (What?!)
Two in the am, they got my music playin'
Begging me to hit the stage, but Iâm like âWhoâs payin'?â

Three in the morning the pancake house
Four in the morning we be rolling to my house
Five in the morning the lights go out
Six in the morning you can hear us start to shout
Seven in the morning sheâll be callin'cab
Eight in the morning talking about the mush she had
Nine in the morning man she just gettin' home
Talkin' about the over night scenario, scenario
