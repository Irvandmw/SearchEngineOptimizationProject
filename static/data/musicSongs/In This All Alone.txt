Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You could say that I am not who I used to be
And I could say it's all because of you
This is complicated, yeah, this is new for me
But it's my heart I'm listening to

Every time that you're around
All my walls come crashing down
And I am sweopt away like drops
Of rain into the ocean
Kiss me once before you go
In a way that makes me know
That I'm not in this all alone

In your eyes I see my life catching up with me
And you're the finish line I'm running to
Yeah, Ive been good and Ive been just
Who Im supposed to be
Ive been everything but true

I am helpless, at your will
See me shaking standing still
Ive been swept away like drops
Of rain into the ocean
Kiss me once before you go
In a way that makes me know
That im not in this world alone

The door is open now
Oh, wont you show me how
To be right where you are

[Chorus]
