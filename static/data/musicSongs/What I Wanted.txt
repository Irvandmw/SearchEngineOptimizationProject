Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I turned my head away
Didn't wanna hear what you said
You had changed your mind

I showed up insecure
But I thought you would be sure
I guess I had a lost sight

[refrain:]
But at the end of my life
I'll look back on my life
I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life
I'll look back on my life

[chorus:]
See I went after you like I should
I went after what I wanted
I went after what I wanted
And I never really got it
But it don't matter at all

I guess it was a lot
To ask for these things we'd lost
I guess it was just a dream

And time changes many things
But my heart it still sings
For you, I don't know why

But at the end of my life
I'll look back on my life
And I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life
I'll look back on my life

[repeat chorus]

I thought I'd spend my last days
Holding your hand
of my senses lie here dead on the floor

[repeat refrain & chorus]

Everything else I lost it
I went after what I wanted
I went after what I wanted
And the rest don't really matter 
It don't really matter
