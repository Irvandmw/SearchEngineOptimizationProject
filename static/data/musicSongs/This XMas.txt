[Ella Mai (Chris Brown):]
I've been thinking 'bout some jingle bells (ring, ring, ring, ring)
Snow falling on the window-sill (ooh)
Santa baby you can pull ahead, yeah (yeah)
Just make sure you got that thing to give, yeah
I've been a naughty but I want to make up for the bad times (oh yeah)
Baking cookies for you, know you wanna taste it, don't you be shy

Full of cheer
I've been waiting for them 12 Reindeer
Sittin', chillin' under the mistletoe
Lit the tree, I know you feel the glow
Santa baby stay a little, don't you rush, we got time (got time)
I wanna take a selfie with you, show the world you're all mine, all mine yeah

'Cause this Christmas, will be the
First time that I tell you I'm in love with you
But hol' up Santa baby, I got trust issues
I know you gon' be
Dashing through the snow, down these chimneys
I know you got plans, I just wanna make sure you feel me
'Cause this Christmas, will be the
Greatest time of your life from me
I ain't asking for the diamond rings
I ain't really got a list of expensive things
I just want you to myself while the children sleep
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?

(Hooray!)
Time, time, sur-prise
What's inside?
Sweet pie
Chestnut, mine
Good times, on your sleigh-ride

Full of cheer
I've been waiting for your 12 Reindeer
Sittin', chillin' under the mistletoe
Lit the tree, I know you feel the glow
Santa baby stay a little, don't you rush, we got time
(I'm all you need, all you need)
I wanna take a selfie with you, show the world you're all mine, all mine yeah (ooh-woo)

'Cause this Christmas, will be the (this Chrismas)
First time that I tell you I'm in love with you (first time)
But hol' up Santa baby, I got trust issues
I know you gon' be (I know you gon' be)
Dashing through the snow, down these chimneys (crashin' down the chimneys)
I know you got plans, I just wanna make sure you feel me
'Cause this Christmas, will be the (this, this, this)
Greatest time of your life from me
I ain't asking for the diamond rings (ooh)
I ain't really got a list of expensive things
I just want you to myself while the children sleep
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?

Frosty, the snowman, it's cold out today
Hot cocoa is waiting, come get you a taste
On the 2nd Day of Christmas, my baby gave to me
Two Doves, like to think it's you and me
1st Day of Christmas, my baby gave to me
Real love and joyful memories

'Cause this Christmas, will be the (hey)
First time that I tell you I'm in love with you
But hol' up Santa baby, I got trust issues (I got)
I know you gon' be
Dashing through the snow, down these chimneys (chimneys)
I know you got plans, I just wanna make sure you feel me
'Cause this Christmas, will be the (will be)
Greatest time of your life from me
I ain't asking for the diamond rings (no, no)
I ain't really got a list of expensive things (I ain't got)
I just want you to myself while the children sleep
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?

Ring, ring, ring, ring
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?
