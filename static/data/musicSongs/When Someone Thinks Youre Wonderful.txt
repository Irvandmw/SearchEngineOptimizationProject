Lyrics:


When someone wonderful thinks you're wonderful
Aladdin's lamp belongs to you
With someone beautiful it's so beautiful
To hear her sigh I love you I do
Then suddenly you hear music
The sound of a thousand guitars
A kiss is a magic carpet to the stars

When someone wonderful thinks you're wonderful
It's paradise a dream come true
Especially if that someone is you
