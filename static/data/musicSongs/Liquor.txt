Lyrics:


There's something in this liquor
The air is getting thicker
I can't help but to stare at you
Girl what did you do
To me?

Tell me what did you slip up in my cup girl?
'Cause I want you
I had a little bit too much girl
So come over here

There's something in this liquor
The air is getting thicker
All I want is you, you
All I want is you

There's something in this liquor
Girl
I'm looking at your figure
I just want to see you strip right now
Baby let me help you work it out

Girl you look so good
I just want to get right to it
I could beat it up like, like a real nigga should
Baby when we do it

There's something in this liquor
The air is getting thicker
All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you

All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
All I wanna do is drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck
All I want is you
Drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck

There's something in this liquor
There's something in this liquor
Girl
The air is getting thicker

I can't help but to stare at you
Girl what did you do?

What did you slip up in my cup girl?
'Cause I want you
I had a little bit too much girl
So come over here

All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck
Drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck

All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck, fuck, fuck
Drink and fuck, drink fuck, drink and fuck, fuck

Drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, drink fuck, drink and fuck
