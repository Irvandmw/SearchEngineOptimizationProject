Lyrics:


Mmm, mmm,
Lead me on to the light
Oh, take my hand Precious Lord
And lead your child home

When my, when my way goes dreary
Oh, Precious Lord, please linger near
And oh, when my, when my life is almost
Almost gone
Father, Father, Father hear my cry, Lord

And oh, hear my call and hold, hold my
Hold my hand, listen Jesus, Lest I fall
Oh, take my hand Precious Lord and lead, lead, lead me on
