Lyrics:


Say it now
Don't wait until the grass grows over
You can still
Express yourself when you are sober
Fools rush in
But sometimes it's the fools who get it right

Do it now
Don't wait until there's no tomorrow
More procrastination won't save you from sorrow
You will have to build the path
To where you want to go

And you make mistakes
And you make amends
But the path still bends
Towards the bitter end
So the thing to do
Just for its own sake's
Is to build a world that's much less rotten
Cos in good time we're all forgotten

And you make mistakes
And you make amends
But the path still bends
Towards the bitter end
So the thing to do
Just for its own sake's
Is to build a world that's much less rotten
Cos in good time we're all forgotten

Say it now
Don't wait until the grass grows over
You can still
Express yourself when you are sober
Fools rush in
But sometimes it's the fools who get it
Fools rush in
But sometimes it's the fools who get it
Fools rush in
But sometimes it's the fools who get it right
Who get it right

Who get it right
Sometimes it's the fools who get it right
