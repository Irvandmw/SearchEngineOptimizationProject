Lyrics:


Oh when you smilin', when you smilin'
The whole world smiles with you
Yes when you laughin', when you laughin'
Yes the sun come shinin' through

But when you cryin' you bring on the rain
So stop your sighin' baby and be happy again
Yes and keep on smilin, keep on smilin'
And the whole world smiles with you
