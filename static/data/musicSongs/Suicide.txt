Lyrics:


Yes, unspoken, unheard of
The love I feel for you
In my opinion, they don't know
All the things you do

When a million fires are burning
Only you can put them out
On the days the rain is pouring
You can take away the clouds of doubt

It could be fatal, damage my life
Walking away would be suicide
I found an angel to turn on my lights
Walking away would be suicide
And I'm not trying to hurt myself
I couldn't bare to live without you
Thought I was living but now I'm alive
Walking away would be suicide
It would be suicide, suicide
It would be suicide, suicide

I remember a time before you
The dust was in my heights
So tender but then you showed me
All the truth from lies

When a million fires are burning
Only you can put them out
On the days the rain is pouring
You can take away the clouds of doubt

It could be fatal, damage my life
Walking away would be suicide
I found an angel to turn on my lights
Walking away would be suicide
And I'm not trying to hurt myself
I couldn't bare to live without you
Thought I was living but now I'm alive
Walking away would be suicide
It would be suicide, suicide
It would be suicide, suicide

This is no accident
Some days are meant to be
It's not hard to comprehent
You're the reason I'll never leave

It could be fatal, damage my life
Walking away would be suicide
I found an angel to turn on my lights
Walking away would be suicide
And I'm not trying to hurt myself
I couldn't bare to live without you
Thought I was living but now I'm alive
Walking away would be suicide
It would be suicide, suicide
It would be suicide, suicide
It would be suicide, suicide
It would be suicide, suicide

It could be fatal, damage to my life
If I walk away it would be suicide
Thought I was living but now I'm alive
If I walk away it would be suicide
(Suicide, hahaha)
