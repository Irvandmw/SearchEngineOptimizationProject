[Iyaz:]
Ariana
Oh, yes

Last night was crazy, and today it's settin' in
Did you really mean it and could you say it again?
Oh, oh
Even if you just say it over the phone
(Come on and ring, ring, ring, ring)

Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb, and paranoid (oh, yeah)
But I'll take a chance on us and hope you don't destroy
My heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
What you say, boy?

[Iyaz:]
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
I'm tellin' you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only
You're my only one and only

You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh-oh)
Girl, it's only you (oh-oh)
You're my only, you're my only
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only, you're my only shorty

[Ariana Grande:]
Every day and night, you got an open invitation (whoa-oh)
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly with me
I'll be your fantasy

You're in demand, but, baby, baby so am I
But if you're weak
And try to sneak
I'll have to tell you bye-bye
I'm a put you on the spot
Am I your only girl or not?
What ya say, boy?

[Iyaz:]
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only?)
I'm tellin' you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only
(Am I your only)
You're my only one and only

You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)
You're my only, you're my only
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only, you're my only shorty

See yeah back in the day
I was trapped in a daze
Trying to run game
But I've actually changed
(Same old!)
When I see you passing, the passionate flames
Simple interaction is all that I crave
I don't need to bring in all the attention
Girl, I need you, your love and affection
Oh, yeah, baby girl, did I mention?

You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Baby, come clean!)
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh-oh)
Girl, it's only you (oh-oh)
You're my only, you're my only
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only one and only

You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh-oh)
Girl, it's only you (oh-oh)
You're my only, you're my only
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only, you're my only shorty

Am I your only?
Am I your only?
Tell me, am I your only shorty?
(Yes, you are.)
Wanna hear you say, yeah
(Yes, you are.)
Am I your only shorty?
