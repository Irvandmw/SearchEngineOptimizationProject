On an neverending trail
Though my pathway wanders for awhile
Someday my ship will sail

I will walk it with a smile
And I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
