Lyrics:


Came in like a vision from the old west wind
Like a bright new dream that I was stepping in
I saw your face and I knew it was a sign
And I still think about that moment all of the time

You know that I could never make this up
I found the reason I'm not giving up
I felt the fever and I knew he was mine
Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time

And in the morning when I'm waking up
I swear that you're the first thing that I'm thinking of
I feel it in my body, know it in my mind
Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time

Oh, I never knew it, yeah, you took me by surprise
While I was getting lost so deep inside your diamond eyes
So many things that I still wanna say
And if devotion is a river, then I'm floating away

And in the morning when you pick me up
And all the world is quiet, tip the mourning dove
I feel it in my body, know it in my mind
Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time

Ooh, don't slow down now, gonna break me down
Keep your hands in my hair, keep your mouth on my mouth
Don't slow this down, never let me go
Baby, don't you wanna see how far this thing can go?

And in the morning when you wake me up
I know that forever could never be enough
I feel it in my body, know it in my mind
Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
For a long time

Oh, I'm gonna love you for a long time
Ooh, I'm gonna love you for a long time
Yeah, I'm gonna love you for a long time
Won't you keep me, let me love you for a long time?
For a long, long, long, long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
