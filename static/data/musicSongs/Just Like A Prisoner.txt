Lyrics:


Just like a prisoner,
He don't know right from wrong.
Just like a baby,
He sings a pleading song

And that's why
So many tears must fall.
Yes, that's why
So many tears must fall.

Just like a sailor,
He steers away from home.
He feels a tidal wave
In his heart, but he ain't alone

[Repeat First Chorus]

I'm like that prisoner,
I don't know right from wrong.
Just like that baby,
I sing a pleading song

And that's why
You'll never know how I feel.
Yes, that's why
You'll never know how I feel.
