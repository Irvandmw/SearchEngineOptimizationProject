Lyrics:


My dad can light my room at night
With just his being near
And make a fearful dream alright
By grinning ear to ear

My dad can do most anything
He sets his mind to do
He'd even move a mountain
If he really wanted to

My dad can sweeten up a day
That clouds and rain may
And tell me funny stories
That will chase the clouds away

My dad's the only one on earth
I can tell my troubles to
His arms are house and home to me
His face, a pretty poem to me

My dad's the finest friend I ever knew
I only wish that you could know him too
