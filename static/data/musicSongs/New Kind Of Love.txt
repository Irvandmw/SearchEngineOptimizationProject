Lyrics:


It must be some kind of magic
That brought this sparkle to my eye
Because I never could imagine happen
Even more love in my life

Now all I do, is care for you
Everyday and every night
It's hard to explain it
Just how it feels

It gives me sweet little pains in my heart
Like a sweet little rain that falls for a flower
You're what matters
Baby, you're the star
And that's love
A new kind of love
And that's love
A new kind of love

Whatever you want you can have it, yeah
I put you first every time
Yeah, it's so easy being selfless with you
Because your happiness is mine

Now all I do, is think of you
With every choice I'll make in my life
It's hard to explain it
Just how it feels

It gives me sweet little pains in my heart
Like a sweet little rain, that falls for a flower
You're what matters
Baby, you're the star
And that's love
A new kind of love
And that's love
A new kind of love

And every day and every moment
Every second of my life
You're every dream, you're every wish
You're every star up in the sky
You're all that I adore
Never felt like this before

It gives me sweet little pains in my heart
Like a sweet little rain that falls for a flower
You're what matters
Baby, you are the star
And that's love
A new kind of love

It gives me sweet little pains in my heart
Like a sweet little rain, that falls for a flower
You're what matters
Baby, you're the star
And that's love
A new kind of love
And that's love
A new kind of love
And that's love
A new kind of love
