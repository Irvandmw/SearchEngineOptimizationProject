Lyrics:


[Reversed Speech:]
Is short
I am, ah
Currently on my
World tour
For The Incredible True Story
Uh, don't think too much into this shit man
Just have fun with it
It's that simple
It's crazy to think I'm currently on this tour
I'm working on two albums
The first of which that you will hear
Just know that
After this turn up shit, after this fun shit
Yo, man, you're in store for something special
Don't think too much man, just shut the fuck up and enjoy it

[Singing:]
Ahhh bro
It's been a hell of a ride out
It's been a hell of a ride out
