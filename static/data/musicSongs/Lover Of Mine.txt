Lyrics:


Lover of mine
Maybe we'll take some time
Kaleidoscope mind
Gets in the way
Hope and I pray
Darling, that you will stay
Butterfly lies
Chase them away
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Dance around the living room
Lose me in the sight of you
I've seen the red, I've seen the blue
Take all of me
Deep to where your secrets hide
Where we've been a thousand times
Swallow every single lie
Take all of me

I'll never give you away, 'cause
I've already made that mistake, if
My name never fell off your lips, again
I know it'd be such a shame
When I take a look at my life
And all of my crimes
You're the only thing that
I think I got right
I'd never give you away, 'cause
I've already made
Already made that mistake

Lover of mine
I know you're color-blind
I've watched the world fall from your eyes
Ohh, ooh, ooh
All my regrets
And things you can't forget
Light them all up
Kiss them goodbye

Dance around the living room
Lose me in the sight of you
I've seen the red, I've seen the blue
Take all of me
Deep to where your secrets hide
Where we've been a thousand times
Swallow every single lie
Take all of me

I'll never give you away, 'cause
I've already made that mistake, if
My name never fell off your lips, again
I know it'd be such a shame
When I take a look at my life
And all of my crimes
You're the only thing that
I think I got right
I'd never give you away, 'cause
Already made
Already made that mistake
