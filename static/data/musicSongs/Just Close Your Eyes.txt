Lyrics:


Let me take you to Capri and we'll sail to Neapoli
Oh, what lovely sights we'll see just close your eyes
Picture us in London town while the rain is drifting down
See the diomand of the crown just close your eyes.

Imagine tropic waters gleamin' though we're only dreamin'
When you're in love it makes you feel each dram you dream is real
We can watch the sun in Rome sparkling on a palace dome
While we're holding hands at home just close your eyes.

Though we're only dreamin'
When you're in love it makes you feel each dram you dream is real
We can watch the sun in Rome sparkling on a palace dome
While we're holding hands at home just close your eyes...
