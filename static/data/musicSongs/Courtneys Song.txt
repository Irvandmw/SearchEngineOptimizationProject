Lyrics:


There's still a light on your table
There's still your name on my phone
I can't believe I'm not able
To call

We met in a beautiful place
You danced, I talked
I go back there every single day
I'm still there but you're not

You lit me up and led me inside
Then you disappeared with no warning sign
You broke more than my heart
When you left without saying goodbye
I'm here to let you know
I'm here to let you go

There's still your voice in my memory
There's still a way that you move
I can't believe that's the way out
You choose

We live in a beautiful world
We danced, we talked
I found a girl and she stayed with me
She's here and you're not

You lit me up and you led me inside
Then you disappeared with no warning sign
You broke more than my heart
When you left without saying goodbye
I'm here to let you know
I'm here to let you go

We live, we breathe
We hope, we bleed
We love, we lose
We die

We live, we breathe
We hope, we bleed
We love, we lose
We die

We live, we breathe
We hope, we bleed
We love, we lose
We die

We live, we breathe
We hope, we bleed
We love, we lose
We die

You lit me up and you led me inside
Then you disappeared with no warning sign
You broke more than my heart
When you left without saying goodbye
I'm here to let you know
I'm here to let you go
