Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I, I who have nothing.
I, I who have no one
Adore you, and want you so
I'm just a no one 
With nothing to give you but love
I love you.

He, he buys you diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But believe me
Dear when I say
That he can give you the world
But he'll never love you the way
I love you.

He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with my nose
Pressed up against the window pane.

I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Must watch you
Go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
When Darling it's I 
Who loves you.
