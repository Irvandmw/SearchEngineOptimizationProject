Lyrics:


Here I go again, in a great big world of spin
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, I'm in love again
Just like the time before, only I'm hurtin' more
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, I'm in love again

My heart was made of ice, til you kissed me twice
Your lips caused a flame so hot
Melted my heart right on the spot

Now gee little honey do what I feel for you
I know it'll last til eternity

Alright

My heart was made of ice, til you kissed me twice
Your lips caused a flame so hot
Melted my heart right on the spot

Now gee little honey do what I feel for you
I know it'll last til eternity

I, I, I, know, know, know, know, know it'll last til eternity
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah it'll last til eternity
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah it'll last til eternity
