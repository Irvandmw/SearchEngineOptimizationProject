Lyrics:


I can see no reason why you wanna leave, baby
Well I don't beg but I'm begging you, pin me oh baby
If I left you now you wouldn't dig by the door
Put them clothes back in the closet baby
Hold on would you do it?
I'm gonna lay my cards on the table
I can't win this hand I ain't able
You know why?

Cause you got all the aces in the deck baby
And I can't let you quit me not yet, no honey
You got all the aces in the deck baby, yes you do
I can't let you quit me not yet, no baby

I told you I'll love you always
Rainy shiny stormy weather cloudy days
And I ain't go back all my words Lord I swear
If you walk out the door now just wouldn't be fair no
If you leave me now I'm a looser
Play just one more hand I demand
You know why

Cause you got all the aces in the deck baby
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no honey
You got all the aces in the deck sugar, yes you do
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no baby

You got all the aces in the deck baby
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no honey
You got all the aces in the deck sugar, yes you do
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no baby

You got all the aces in the deck baby
And I can't let you quit me not yet, no honey
You got all the aces in the deck sugar
And I can't let you leave me not yet, no baby
