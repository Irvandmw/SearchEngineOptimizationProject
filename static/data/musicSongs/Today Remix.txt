[Intro:]
Baby
Ah, bitch (Ha, ha, ha, Baby Talk 5)
Fuck a nigga mean, nigga (Baby Talk 5)
Fuck you talkin' 'bout (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[DaBaby:]
I'm on they ass today
I just went and picked me up a bag today
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil' bae
She got a fat ass, when I smash, it shakes
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil' baby mad at me
Fucked up her ass, she look bad today

Told her, "Hop in the whip, we can go get a fix"
I'ma drop that bitch off at my set, she the shit
As soon as she done with that nappy ass hair
You can pick up your boy to come pick up his bitch (Damn)
Look at my wrist, that's a brick
I just fucked up my Rolex, but fuck it, it's lit (Damn)
I don't give a fuck 'bout no fame and no chain
Ain't no jewelry put me on the lick (Damn)
I just went sat with the label (Huh?)
Niggas offered me a contract (What happened?)
Told them niggas I ain't want it (Why?)
The shit was whack, I didn't sign that (Uh)
I'm the best but never mind that (Okay)
My shit so hard that they rewind that (Ah)
Got that work if you can't find that (Huh?)
You can't afford it, we can finance
I got one foot in the trap, got one foot up they ass, ditch your coat on the rack
Got my dick in your bitch, she be bendin' it over and bustin' it open and throwin' it back
I'm tryna go fuck a bunny
Fuck all these hoes 'cause they don't really love me
I'm tryna get me some motherfuckin' money
If they free Meek Mill, why they ain't free my cousin?
I bet we shoot up your motherfuckin' party
If somebody touch me or one of my brothers
I bet that none of these niggas that talk on the internet try me, they see me in public
I bet they play all my motherfuckin' teachin'
Bitch, I don't rap, I be motherfuckin' preachin'
I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' show
And I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' feature (Bitch)

I'm on they ass today
I just went and picked me up a bag today
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil' bae
She got a fat ass, when I smash, it shakes
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil' baby mad at me
Fuck it, let's go to the bank

[Lil Baby:]
Baby, racks, keep them on me like I live in the bike
Pints, Act (Act), [?] the syrup like I live off the drink
My fashion is high, I live in the sky
I'm keeping my fire, I hope they don't try
You heard I'm on fire, but that ain't no lie
My youngin's, I love 'em, I know they gon' ride
Racks, hunnid, get 'em knocked off and won't think about it (Fa-fa)
Lie to your honor
Look him straight in the face and won't blink about it
I just finessed for a bag today
We wipe they nose, yeah, the nasty way
NASCAR my car, yeah, the fastest way
Fuck on your bitch, I don't masturbate
I just kept it one hunnid, they had to hate
I heat it up, and I blast away
Ain't do no whippin', it's glass today
She let me hit it, I had to pay
She let me get it, you had to wait
I'm still ahead of my class today
I do the dash with no license plate
Nigga try me, he gon' die today

[DaBaby:]
I'm on they ass today
I just went and picked me up a bag today
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil' bae
She got a fat ass, when I smash, it shakes
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil' baby mad at me
Fuck it, let's go to the bank

I'm 'bout to motherfuckin' blank
My name hold weight, I got motherfuckin' rank
I'm in the rental with my brother Thank
We tryna eat, where our motherfuckin' plate? (Ha)
It's been there with me, y'all just motherfuckin' late
I need that shit now, I can't motherfuckin' wait
I bet you act like you motherfuckin' know
I put this four-five in your motherfuckin' face, bitch

I'm on they ass today
I just went and picked me up a bag today
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil' bae
She got a fat ass, when I smash, it shakes
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil' baby mad at me
Fuck it, let's go to the bank
