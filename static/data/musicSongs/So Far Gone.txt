Lyrics:


I know they say that the space between
Can make it stronger than weâve ever seen
They might be right but I disagree
Cause Iâve never felt stronger than when youâre with me

Sometimes I wonder why you even care
Cause even when I leave youâre always there with me
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark youâve made on me canât be erased. 

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you..

Iâve stood alone and Iâve fallen down
Your hands were there to pick me off the ground
Sometimes I cry cause I canât believe
Your love is big enough to cover me

Sometimes Iâve wondered if youâre even there
But when I feel far away you meet me there
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark youâve made on me canât be erased
Yeah..

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you..

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you..I wanna be lost

I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
I wanna get lost in you
Underneath your sky

I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
So far gone tonight

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In youâ¦

So far gone in you
In you
In you
So far gone in you
