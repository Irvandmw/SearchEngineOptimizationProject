Lyrics:


Just take a moment to remember
The love that we once knew
Darling just don't go
'Cause I love you so
And I can't believe we're through

If you'll just take a moment you'll discover
That I need you so close to me
So give our romance just one more chance
For our love is meant to be

Just take a moment, think of the past
Take your time and don't think so fast
I know you'll find that our love will last
For eternity

Just take a moment to believe me
For it's your love that I'm livin' for
If you'll promise never to leave me
Then our love will last ever more

So just take a moment to believe me
For it's your love that I'm livin' for
If you stay here never to leave me
That moment will last ever more
Yes that moment will last ever more
Well that moment will last ever more
