Lyrics:


I'd love to spend this Christmas sitting by the fire with you
Well, I'd love to spend this Christmas sitting by the fire with you
I'm happy for the moment, sharin' the whole day with you
Jingle bells are ringing, children playing out in the snow
Jingle bells are ringing, children playing out in the snow
There be turkey on the table, presents everywhere you go

Everyone seems so happy, seasons greetings in the air
Everyone seems so happy, seasons greetings in the air
Santa Claus is spreadin' presents, spreadin' presents everywhere

I won't be home to help you decorate your Christmas tree
Well, I know I won't be with you decorate your Christmas tree
Well, I'll be thinking about you baby, and I hope you thinkin' 'bout me
