Lyrics:


Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2AM, it feels like summer

Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it like every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone like every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life
Ah-ah

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance

My baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Rolled down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner
Ah-ah

Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing, I
Lose myself in the music, baby
Everyday is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightening, I
Sing it into my music, I'm crazy

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance
With you
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you
