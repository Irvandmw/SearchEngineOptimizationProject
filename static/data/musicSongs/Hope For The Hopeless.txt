Lyrics:


I'm counting all my bruises
I'm not counting on myself
I've been wreaking all this havoc
Cause I thought it'd suit me well
Never careful what I wish for
Never careful with what I say
Always begging for attention
In my sick and twisted way

I could reach the stars

There's hope for the hopeless
Now that I know this
You give me the strength to carry on
The voice in the silence
Is crushing the violence
It's giving me a chance to right these wrongs
I will never quit, this is it
Cause there's hope for the hopeless

Hope for the hopeless

I'm sitting in the shadows
As the bodies hit the floor
And I don't need another reason
Why I can't take anymore
I'm so sick of these excuses
Tired of living in the dark
And I won't be another victim
Starving from an empty heart

But I'll rise to reach the stars

There's hope for the hopeless
Now that I know this
You give me the strength to carry on
The voice in the silence
Is crushing the violence
It's giving me a chance to right these wrongs
I will never quit, this is it
Cause there's hope for the hopeless

I won't suffocate in vain
I won't die in apathy
I've stood out on the edge and faced eternity
Saw freedom in the fall but I finally believed
I'd never be alone

There's hope for the hopeless
Now that I know this
You give me the strength to carry on
The voice in the silence
Is crushing the violence
It's giving me a chance to right these wrongs
I will never quit, this is it
Cause there's hope for the hopeless

Hope for the hopeless
