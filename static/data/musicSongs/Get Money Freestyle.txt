Lyrics:


Ay, ay, ay

Bad bitch in the [?]
Trapping like I'm J-Zay
Ye fuck with Trump so I didn't buy the Yeezays
Think I seen Obama hooping in DC in these days
Rapping loops around your favorite rapper like a freeway
Hear a story 'bout me, then they spin it like a DJ
Playing telephone with that "He say" and that "She say"
Why in the hell are they fucking with the Huxtables?
Niggas turn 99, now they wanna say somethin'?
Just another hero turned to a zero
That is why they need to put more women in these lead roles
Let my niggas eat though!
Let the streets eat though!
Fiends rocking around like it's Resident Evil
Real bitch, pre-op, pictures with the peace sign
Low rise jeans barely chained like it's '05
Bachelorette getting that bachelor's degree
I ain't gonna be on my ass if a nigga leave me
I be trying to make A's while my niggas movin' P's
He know I'ma have his back 'cause that's how it's suppose to be
When your niggas ain't got you
Momma didn't watch you
Move with your granny but your granny couldn't stop you
Making all that money, now these bitches wanna top you
Go to sleep, then they pick your pocket, pied the piper
Huh

Ay, hold up, ay

Too hood for the 'burbs, too 'burbs for the hood
But I know anywhere I go I'ma be good
Big bank like I'm Hillary
Prissy bitch, but I still visit penitentiaries
'Cause I got some niggas that'll take care of my enemies
Don't play me like I'm pussy
How I [?] you in this Gucci
Yeah, I'm snooty but I'll lose it
They say Megan too raw and Megan too nasty
'Cause I make 'em eat it on my couch like he castin'
Walk in, make the dick salute like a captain
Walk in, in the-aah!
