Lyrics:


There's no doubt about it now
Youth has gone
It shines upon some other brow
Not this one
Lends its air of carelessness
To another manly breast
Dolling out its confidence
To the bright and to the dense
There's no doubt about it now
Youth has gone

There's no doubt about it now
I love you
Much deeper after all the years
We've lived through
Romance is just an old idea
When you've reached your middle years
But love is something to behold
As the old idea unfolds
There's no doubt about it now
I love you

Though age and love rest in my mind
There's something else that I can't find
No I just can't find, no just can't find

There's no doubt about it now
I can't find a reason for existence
In my mind
I feel there must be something else
but maybe I just fool myself
I want to know the God you know
but he never seems to show
There's no doubt about it now
I don't know
