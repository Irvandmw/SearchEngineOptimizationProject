Lyrics:


So you want
To be free
To live your life
The way you wanna be
Will you give?
If we cry
Will we live?
Or will we die?
Uh huh

Tainted hearts
Heal with time
Shoot bad love
So we can stop the beating

Solitary brother
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister
Is there still a part of you that wants to give?

Solitary brother
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister
Is there still a part of you that wants to give?

Yeah

It was the 3rd of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
âCause that was the day, my Daddy died

I never had the chance to see him, no
Never heard nothing but bad things about him
Mama I'm depending on you
To tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said

Your Papa was a rolling stone yeah
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
(And when he died)
All that he left us was alone
But my mama she said

Your Papa was a rolling stone yeah
Oh my mama said
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
(And when he died)

All he left us
All he left us

Can you believe he left us?

All alone yeah
All alone yeah
All alone yeah
Yeah
