Lyrics:


A shining badge, a suit to match
Bit my nails down so they wouldn't scratch
But who believes in needs like these?
I'll take two of 'em, please

Soft skin soft eyes
All these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs
They always kept me up at night
But I can't change my appetite, 'cause

Your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
Your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me

'Cause he and she is her
And her and he are loved
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he and she is her
And her and he are loved
A child in all these labels

And my girl, she
Always wore a skirt in the classroom
Eating my dessert in the bathroom
Can't get caught so we stiller than a statue
Bad news, think I'll probably die before I have you

Soft skin soft eyes
All these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs
They always kept me up at night
But I live for loving impolite, 'cause

Your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
Your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me

'Cause he and she is her
And her and he are loved
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he and she is her
And her and he are loved
A child in all these labels

'Cause he and she is her
And her and he are loved
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he and she is her
And her and he are loved
A child in all these labels
