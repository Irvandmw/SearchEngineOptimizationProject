Lyrics:


I've had good luck, and bad luck
And no luck, it's true
But I always get lucky with you
I've been turned on, and turned down
When the bars close at two
But I always get lucky with you
I keep strikes against me
Most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call
I'm minus a dime
There's been good days, and bad days
But when the day is through
Hun, I've always got lucky with you

I've keep two strikes against me
Most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call
I'm minus a dime
There's been good days, and bad days
But when the day is through
I always get lucky with you

Oh, I always get lucky with you
I always get lucky with you
