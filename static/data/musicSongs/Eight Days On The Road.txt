Lyrics:


Sugar baby, be my saviour
âCause Iâm tired, Iâm tired, Iâve been eight days on the road, eh (thatâs right?)
Thatâs right, yes it is, eight days on the road
Travelinâ through the night
There ainât no town, there ainât no town
There ainât no rest tonight, yeah (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

Iâm in and busted, standing on the county line (it does)
And thatâs why, yeah, thatâs why Iâve been eight days on the road, yeah (eight days on the road)
Now, thatâs right, yes it is, eight days on the road (it does)
Travelinâ through the night
There ainât no town, there ainât no town
There ainât no rest tonight (eight days on the road)

Iâm here out thinkinâ, thinkinâ, Iâm thinkinâ âbout of what Iâve done (what Iâve done)
And thatâs why, yeah, Iâve been eight days on the road, ah (eight days on the road)
Thatâs right, oooh, eight days on the road
Travelinâ through the night
Iâm cominâ my home, It wonât be long
Iâll make Birmingham tonight (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Yes I will, yes I will (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

Iâm makinâ it back to you, baby, come on (anymore)
Iâm makinâ it back to you, baby, yeah (anymore)
Iâm makinâ it back to you, baby, no way (anymore)
Iâm makinâ it back to you, baby (anymore)

Oooh, eight days (eight days on the road, uuuh)
Eight days on the road, uuuh
Yeah, thatâs right, yes it is (eight days on the road, uuuh)
Iâve been eight days on the road, yeah
Ooh, Iâve been sucked (sucked)
Iâve been eight days on the road, uuuh (eight days on the road, uuuh)
Oooh, yes it is, Iâve been eight days on the road (eight days on the road, uuuh)
