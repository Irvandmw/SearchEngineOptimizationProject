Lyrics:


Don't you know it's been too long, since I've seen you smile
And I can't wait for another month to go on by
It feels like it's been three years since you put your arms around me
And I can't handle all these tears, so please just please surround me

you've waisted all this time hiding back your love
But now I'm all caught up with you yet everything feels wrong
Oh please confess to me why, why you're so afraid,
Cause now you know just how I feel, yeah I feel the same

[Chorus:]
Cause you be with you would be quite the adventure
But I can't except the quest you see he's pulling me under
Yeah to be with you seems only a dream
But now I got two roads to choose from yeah they're hurting me
Yeah they're hurting me, yeah they're hurting me, yeah they're hurting me
Oh cause I'm in between (yeah you see it's killing me)

Don't you know it's been too long since I've seen you smile
And this pain wont go away, not for a while (not for a while)
But I'll hold on till that day when you walk my way
I hope that you'll forgive the rest and start a new day

Yeah you've waisted all this time hiding back your love
But now I'm all caught up with you yet everything feels wrong
Oh please confess to me why, why your so afraid,
Cause now you know just how I feel, yeah I feel the same

[Chorus]

Oh yeah the cut feels deeper within my skin
Can't top myself from bleeding
Gotta hold it right tonight gotta hold on tight with all my might
Cause I know that its right

[Chorus]
