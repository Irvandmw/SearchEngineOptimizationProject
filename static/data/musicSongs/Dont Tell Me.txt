Lyrics:


You call me up to let me know, just how good you've been doing
I don't wanna let it show but I can't keep pretending
I bet you think that I've moved on but I can't move since you've been gone
And I can't believe that we said it and now you won't let me forget it

Don't tell me that you're going out tonight
Don't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me that you're all alone tonight
Don't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know

It's getting harder not to fool, 'cause I love how you fool me
There's a lovely lonely road, I'm lying where you left me
Take my heart and take my gold, leave what's left and let me go
It's hard to believe that you said it and now you won't let me forget it

Don't tell me that you're going out tonight
Don't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me that you're all alone tonight
Don't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know
That tonight you're getting out with your friends
And how you wish it was me, not them, yeah

Don't tell me that you're going out tonight
Don't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me that you're all alone tonight
Don't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know

Don't tell me that you're going out tonight
Don't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me that you're all alone tonight
Don't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know
