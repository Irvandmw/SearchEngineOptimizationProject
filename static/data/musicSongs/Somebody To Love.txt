Lyrics:


Never could imagine
The way the story happened
You with someone new
I used to be your focus
Now you don't even notice
When I leave the room

You weren't even trying to make me jealous
But you can't help it
You can't help it

And it kills me to know that you found
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

Tell me how can I go on without
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

They say that loves come easy
Whenever it comes easy
I see it on your face
I don't want you to be lonely
But right now I'm the only
One who feels this way

I ain't even trying to make you miss me
Make you miss me
I know we're history

But it kills me to know that you found
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

Tell me how can I go on without
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

SOME
BODY
TO LOVE
SOME
BODY
SOME
BODY
TO
LOVE
SOME
BODY

You weren't even trying to make me jealous
But you can't help it
You can't help it

And it kills me to know that you found
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

Tell me how I can go on without
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

I used to be your focus
Now you don't even notice
When I leave the room
