[Hook]
Dirty money, check that shit in rubber bands
Foreign whips, it call me by a couple grands
Foreign bitches, only tell em bring a friend
Hunned deep, every g, fuckin taliban
Thuggin in money, bad bitchâs upon me
No need to be stunting, money keep on comin

That dirty money like diddy, my bad bitches they pretty
My chains will leave you dizzy,
Iâm staying up on my grizzy
Iâm stacking money like 50
Iâm more versace than biggy
Iâm popping bands like diggy, my night [?] future simmons
Iâm most requested in clubs, Iâm making girls fall in love
Iâm popping bottles of bud, if I make it rain itâs gonn flood
Once I make it rain itâs gonn thunder
Iâm ballin like oklahoma
Iâm chasin after them come up
You got benjamins then I want em
You got franklins then I need em
That [?] girl is a diva
I might just have to freeze
She gonn [?] she believe me
Making moves is like steven
A foreign bitch from new zeeland
Her friend donât even speak english!

[Hook]
Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands
Foreign whips, it call me by a couple grands
Foreign bitches, only tell em bring a friend
Hunned deep, every g, fuckin taliban
Thuggin in money, bad bitchâs upon me
No need to be stunting, money keep on comin

Drop that money, flip it like a cogwheel
Bitch tell me how that foreign car feel
Smokin purple got the whole car filled
So much money, why the fuck I rap still?
Money all in my pocket, rubber bands keep poppin
Thinking hustle, hustle, hustle
Like nah nigga I ainât stoppin
See my jug [?] keep boomin
Drop top and Iâm coolin
Iâm foolin, nah, nigga out here doing what we doing
See the young niggas is poppin now
Pluto we ainât comin down, nah
No we ainât comin down
Scooter say itâs all about the cash money
Stripper bitches love shaking ass for me

[Hook]
Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands
Foreign whips, it call me by a couple grands
Foreign bitches, only tell em bring a friend
Hunned deep, every g, fuckin taliban
Thuggin in money, bad bitchâs upon me
No need to be stunting, money keep on comin

Iâm strapped up, the cannon in my pack
And just let it out, I remix it, pack it up
Then I put it back in the band
Iâm super future, Iâm jammin the roof
And panoramic the coupe
Got brain damage, Iâm a freeband gang bandit
Iâm [?] salute me, Iâm going crazy
I get blowed until Iâm faded,
I trap until they rate it
I hustle I ainât made it
Iâm scorching on fire blazin
You wish you were that fresh
You see how Iâm dressed
Got a foreign bitch on deck
She know I got that check

[Hook]
Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands
Foreign whips, it call me by a couple grands
Foreign bitches, only tell em bring a friend
Hunned deep, every g, fuckin taliban
Thuggin in money, bad bitchâs upon me
No need to be stunting, money keep on comin.
