Lyrics:


Isn't it strange how a man hides his feelings?
Sometimes the one that he loves never knows
And isn't strange when she's finally leaving
That it all starts to show when she goes

I passed my friend, he didn't look the way he did before
I always knew he was a stronger man than me
I asked my friend if he needed any help from me
He said she's all I need, I know you know
I only wish I had told her long ago

Isn't it strange how a man hides his feelings?
Sometimes the one that he loves never knows
And isn't strange when she's finally leaving
That it all starts to show when she goes

I once found love, but never got beyond my selfish dreams
I took for granted that she'd be there every day
I closed her out, knowing she could never change he lovin' ways
Things fell apart and she got scared
I wonder if she knew how much I really cared

Isn't it strange how a man hides his feelings?
Sometimes the one that he loves never knows
And isn't strange when she's finally leaving
That it all starts to show when she goes, starts to go away
Yeah, isn't it strange when she's finally leaving
That it all starts to show when she goes

You may find love, if you do you're fortunate
'Cause that's the rarest thing in all the world you'll find
Someone who cares, who shares the good an bad of it
You just make sure she understands how much you care
And wherever you may go she will be there

Isn't it strange how a man hides his feelings?
Sometimes the one that he loves never knows
And isn't strange when she's finally leaving
That it all starts to show when she goes, starts to go away
