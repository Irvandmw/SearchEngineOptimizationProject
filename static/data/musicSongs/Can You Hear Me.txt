Lyrics:


I am numb but i can still feel you
Sometimes Iâm blind but I see you
You are here but so far away

The times when you wanna.. Im missing you
Makes me feel like Iâm spinning
Sometimes you get what you gain

Iâm on a course of collision
Am not about to give in
Canât explain my position or the condition that Iâm in.

Where I am is no limit, no walls, no ceilings
No intermission, so let
Let the party begin.

[Chorus]
Hey.. Hey.. Hey all the way
DJ let it play.
Hey Hey Can You Hear Me?
Oooow

Hey.. Hey.. Hey all the way
DJ let it play.
Hey Hey Can You Hear Me?
Oooow

Can You Hear Me? Can You Hear Me? Can You Hear Me? Can You Hear Me?
Oooow

Donât you mean that youâre my vision
I gotta make a decision
Do I go, do I stay? (Stay)

Youâve gotten into my system
You are in control of my mental
Iâm in a euphoric state

Iâm on a course of collision
Am not about to give in
Canât explain my position or the condition that Iâm in.

Where I am is no limit, no walls, no ceilings
No intermission, so let
Let the party begin

[Chorus]
Hey.. Hey.. Hey all the way
DJ let it play.
Hey Hey Can You Hear Me?
Oooow

Hey.. Hey.. Hey all the way
DJ let it play.
Hey Hey Can You Hear Me?
Oooow

Oooow Oooow Oooow Oooow Oooow Oooow
Can You Hear Me? Can You Hear Me? Can You Hear Me? Can You Hear Me? Can You Hear Me?

Hey.. Hey.. Hey all the way
DJ let it play.
Hey Hey Can You Hear Me?
Can You Hear Me?
[repeat 5x]
