Lyrics:


Love Me Till It Hurts 
Love Me Till It Hurts 

You are the poison â You are the pain
The one chemical inside my veins
It's true â I've been infected by you

I'm not a killer â No I'm not a saint 
And there's nobody left that I can blame
Yeah it's true â I am the poison in you

Will you love me till it hurts? 
Never leave me at my worst? 
Break this cycle 
Break this curse 
Love me till it hurts
We all get what we deserve
Tell me do I have your word?
Break this cycle 
Break this curse
Love me till it hurts
Love me till it hurts

We fell in love but then we went to war
Now I'm the enemy I'm at your door
It's true â I'm only fighting for you

We thought that we could make it through the storm
Hell broke loose and then you fell from my arms
Yeah it's true â I couldn't hold on to you 

Will you love me till it hurts? 
Never leave me at my worst? 
Break this cycle 
Break this curse 
Love me till it hurts
We all get what we deserve
Tell me do I have your word?
Break this cycle 
Break this curse
Love me till it hurts

Will you love me till it hurts? 
Never leave me at my worst? 
Break this cycle 
Break this curse 
Love me till it hurts
We all get what we deserve
Tell me do I have your word?
Break this cycle 
Break this curse
Love me till it hurts
