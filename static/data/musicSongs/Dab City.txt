Lyrics:


I'm dabbin like I'm from Atlanta
I dab like I play for the Panthers
Dabbin like I'm from Atlanta
(Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown)
Dab like I play for the Panthers
I'm dabbin' like I'm from Atlanta
(Why you dab?) I'm dabbin cause I don't like dancin
(Oh my God, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown)
I dab like I play for the Panthers

I'm dabbin like my name is Cameron
I just scored a touchdown and I'm dancing
He live in Charlotte but he from Atlanta
Me and my niggas we think we the Panthers
Look at my dab, sweet Baby Jesus
We been winnin all season, we undefeated
Send the pack off on Friday, Atlanta on the monday
Winnin touchdown it's like Super Bowl sunday

I'm dabbin like I'm from Atlanta
I dab like I play for the Panthers
Dabbin like I'm from Atlanta
(Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown)
Dab like I play for the Panthers
I'm dabbin' like I'm from Atlanta
(Why you dab?) I'm dabbin cause I don't like dancin
I'm dabbin' like I'm from Atlanta
(Oh my God, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown)
I dab like I play for the Panthers

When I be dabbin the bitches they love it
I know I'm spillin my liquor but fuck it
I just be dabbin like I am a Migo
She let me smash I keep it on the D low
I'm ballin, D Rose
Jordan, freethrows
They call me A-town they say I'm retarded
This is not A-town we dabbin' in Charlotte

I'm dabbin like I'm from Atlanta
I dab like I play for the Panthers
Dabbin like I'm from Atlanta
(Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown)
Dab like I play for the Panthers
I'm dabbin' like I'm from Atlanta
(Why you dab?) I'm dabbin cause I don't like dancin
I'm dabbin' like I'm from Atlanta
(Oh my God, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown)
I dab like I play for the Panthers
