Lyrics:


Looking in the mirror Iâm embarrassed
Iâm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
Iâm in the matter of man arm wrestling hands
I was dope when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction
That'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when youâre my type
And you win it from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, Sin City
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
Iâma go ân get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize that, and you weave look good
With the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I donât call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say weâre in the area cruisinâ in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word
Like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you canât see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach 40 pulled up G
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makinâ
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didnât help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr OVOXO, the reason why Iâm breathing on the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason was the highlight was when he said
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died
