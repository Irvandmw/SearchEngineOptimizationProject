Yeah, fuck that shit

You are watching a master at work (yeah)
This what you all been waitin' for ain't it?
Rap game homie, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rapper come and go, I wonder where they went
Ten years of runnin', yeah we came up from the basement
(You are watching a master)
This what you all been waitin' for ain't it?
Rap game homie, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rapper come and go, I wonder where they went
Ten years of runnin', we came up from the basement

Grew up broke as fuck, rich folks was adjacent
Maryland, starin' out the window for motivation
I remember lil Bobby, lil B
Man I wish I could be a dog in a rich family
Oh how nice would that shit be, my life a catastrophe
Now my shit a masterpiece, No Limit like Master P
Now I am the master, see, that's the way it has to be
My life is a movie, I'm so glad God casted me
I am not top ten, more like top three
I am not two 'cause nobody could top me
Get the pussy wet like Jodeci, you know it's me
I can't seem to put my finger on it like a rotary
Somethin's missin' from game, when I'm gone, oh it's me
I feel sorry for these rappers comin' up, oh that was me
I just took a hiatus and wrote a novel, motherfucker
I got more verses than the Holy Bible, motherfucker
Because I'm sittin' on five, unreleased albums
Greatest of all time, no lyin', that's the outcome
I do it for the boombap, the trap and the radio
Fuck a fake fan, step into me and try to play me ho
I make music for every genre, every occasion
Shit is amazin', I'm blazin', it's insane
Going crazy in the gym, going in gains
Had a lot of dark nights, but bitch I been Bane
I was born in the darkness like Rick James
Bitch, sippin' scotch with Chappelle after the Grammys
Said them countries wasn't shit holes, they prolly want to ban me
'Cause I say the shit that others won't, prolly can't stand me (uh)
Like the rappers claim to hate me, but they stan me
I said these rappers claim to hate me, but they motherfuckin' stan me
They hate what I represent, but bitch I am me
They hate what I represent, but bitch I am me

There's nothin' but legendary shit that be goin' on, the phenomenal
You are watching a master at work
This what you all been waitin' for ain't it?
Rap game homie, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rappers come and go, I wonder where they went
Ten years of runnin', yeah we came up from the basement
This what you all been waitin' for ain't it?
Rap game homie, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rappers come and go, I wonder where they went
Ten years of runnin', yeah we came up from the basement

I got my rap, and I got my gat, but I won't bust back
Unless I live with greed I lead this world by example
Education, my lyricism is different prison
The fallacy society has rejected, I'm here to protect it
Everybody dies in this world we livin' in, but not everybody tries, but everybody lies
You can't take money with you when you die so spend it and don't look back like an addict in recovery
But also don't blow it, and don't be a coward, but don't be too heroic
Live your life to the fullest, don't push it or pull it
Don't listen to others because you shouldn't believe shit
We all the same underneath
I had some shit I had to get off my chest in that first verse
But this verse come first when it comes to importance of message
Do what you love, do what you love, do what, do what, do what you love
Don't do it, do it, do it, for society
Break free from the cycle, don't be scared to walk like Michael on the moon
Rattpack, be the platoon so much more be comin' soon
Yeah I'm goin', already knowin', Bobby be flowin'
Shit get around like a woman, my body been gone, my mind been goin
I already know I'm gon' die one day, you gon' die one day, we all 'gon die one day
God already got the plan so live your life, live yo life
You live it, that's a fact, because if you don't live it in the end you gon' be filled with regret

This what you all been waitin' for ain't it?
You are watching a master at work
Rap game homie, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rapper come and go, I wonder where they went
Ten years of runnin', yeah we came up from the basement
This what you all been waitin' for ain't it?
Rap game homie, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rapper come and go, I wonder where they went
Ten years of runnin', yeah we came up from the basement

You are watching a maâ master at work
