Lyrics:


Don't cry mother dear, your boy has left you for a couple of years
He's packed his bags, packed in his courage
Put away his fears and stepped away into the unknown
And postpone all complications, yeah

A kiss goodbye and an upset stomach sends me on my way
What I believe, it gets me by, it gets me through the days
Tears fall and puddles form and days without an end
Determinedness or never building, the war has just begun

And it's one, two, three four, boys all marching out to war
Four, three, two, one, they won't stop til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast, fast as the wheel but the lesson is sealed
Right, left, two step, onto the plane and the men come home
Ooooh... don't you cry for me
Ooooh... I'm coming home to your arms

One, two, three, four, take the lead and I'll follow you
You're a man with a plan, I'm a pawn in your hand
Tears to be bled, sacrifice to be made
It's my fate in your hands

All my brothers by my side with my line shutters tight
I will push the right, oh will you push the left-right
If one man falls they don't move til he's up, a one-man unit at the risk
Our handcuff, it's handcuff

And it's one, two, three four, boys all marching out to war
Four, three, two, one, they won't stop til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast, fast as the wheel but the lesson is sealed
Right, left, two step, onto the plane and the men come home
Ooooh... don't you cry for me
Ooooh... I'm coming home to your arms
Ooooh... don't you cry for me
Ooooh... I'm coming home to your arms

And it's one, two, three four, boys all marching out to war
Four, three, two, one, they won't stop til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast, fast as the wheel but the lesson is sealed
Right, left, two step, onto the plane and the men come home
