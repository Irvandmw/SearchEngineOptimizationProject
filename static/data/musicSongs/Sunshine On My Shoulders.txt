Lyrics:


Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water that is so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I would give a day sure to make you smile
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine on almost makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I would give to you a day just liek today
Ah if I had a song I could sing for you
I would sing a song to make you this way

Sunshine ooo sunshine
la la la la la la la la la la 
la la la la la la la la la la
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost always makes me high

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost always makes me high
