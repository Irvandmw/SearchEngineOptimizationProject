Lyrics:


I got this pretty thang from the west side
Face tatted like I grew up on the east
She ain't foreign but my baby get the best ride
Ooh, she a muhfuckin' beast
And she say I don't pay her attention
I said, "Baby, I'm chasin' these millions"
Scratch my back and say, "Baby, I feel you"
I told her, "Stay down and stay patient, let's get it"

I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
Girl, I'm not finna play with your time
Them lil' niggas just wasting your time
And I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?

Yeah, I can never ever ever ever ever trust another woman
And she can never ever ever ever ever ever trust another nigga
And she know all them funny niggas that she fucking with ain't fucking with me
And any time that it's on your mind, baby, you can come and get it
I be rather waiting, it's not what that other bitch
One of the other ones I say I wasn't fucking with
I'll drop you off and come pick up another bitch
I'll drop it off in her drawers and she loving it
Do what I do, but I swear I don't love a bitch
Don't have the patience, no I cannot take it
I just want the face, yo, I don't want relations
I want you to save it, I know you insane, yeah
She say that she with it, now girl, don't you lie to me
You need to quit it, now girl, don't you lie to me
She know I'm that nigga, I look like the lottery
Don't play with my pistol, you gon' get shit up out of me

I got this pretty thang from the west side
Face tatted like I grew up on the east
She ain't foreign but my baby get the best ride
Ooh, she a muhfuckin' beast
And she say I don't pay her attention
I said, "Baby, I'm chasin' these millions"
Scratch my back and say, "Baby, I feel you"
I told her, "Stay down and stay patient, let's get it"

I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
Girl, I'm not finna play with your time
Them lil' niggas just wasting your time
And I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
