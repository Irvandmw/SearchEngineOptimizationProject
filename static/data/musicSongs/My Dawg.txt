Lyrics:


That's a AR, not a draco, unzip that whenever I say so
She diggin' my drip, I'll sit my bandana on top of my head like a halo
I put your main bitch on payroll
She on the leash, she my dawg
She gon' call me when you go to sleep
And you before we wake up, she deleting my calls
If you love me, then tell me you love me, I need some affection
I just fell out with my bitch 'cause she went through my phone, saw how freak I been textin'
Why I thug it like that, I'm too extra, I don't love these hoes, I'm disrespectful
When I say that's my dawg, I'm talkin' 'bout your bitch and I'm fuckin' her doggy style without protection
I don't need the bitch, it ain't no pressure
Sneeze on bitches, I'ma bless 'em
I bought the pounds tonight
Got 'em all for 27
300%, now that's cappin'
We can talk numbers, fuck rappin'
Baby Jesus, he from Charlotte
Why they think he from Atlanta?
I don't go anywhere without the strap on me
I popped a pill, my bitches say it's bad for me
I fuck the same hoes used to laugh at me
We serve the same niggas used to hate
I'm with your main bitch on a date
That ain't a pussy, baby, that's a lake
If you get money, nigga, we relate
Fuck all them other niggas, let 'em hate, uh
If you love me, then tell me you love me, I need some affection
I just fell out with my bitch 'cause she went through my phone, saw how freak I been textin'
Why I thug it like that, I'm too extra, I don't love these hoes, I'm disrespectful
And if I keep fucking other niggas hoes, I might just fuck around and miss my blessing
I done got way too motherfuckin' comfortable, let me remind myself what's going on
I left my bitch's crib and hit the studio and sold a pound before I made this song
I need a new number, all these nothing ass bitches blowing up a nigga phone
Speaking of nothing, don't nobody owe me nothing, can't nobody come and put me on, huh
Bitch I'm the goat, ain't no other one
I got a bitch want another one, I put your bitch in the full nelson
She tried to run, what you runnin' from?
And I brought the food to the table, told all of my niggas come eat, we gon' run it up
Extended on this gun, that's a honey bun
Try me, I let out a hunnid of 'em

If you love me, then tell me you love me, I need some affection
I just fell out with my bitch 'cause she went through my phone, saw how freak I was textin'
Why I thug it like that, I'm too extra, I don't love these hoes, I'm disrespectful
I just can't help it, baby, I'm a dawg, promise my mama raised a nigga better, yeah, yeah
