Lyrics:


Don't let the blues make you bad.
It hurts so much to lose,
I know, you're sad.
Now you search for fun
you never had.
Allright, but don't let the blues
make you bad.

Don't go to bar at the bar.
Don't let it change,what you are.
It'll take the baddies of the pain.
Her world and your's. They're not the same.

Don't let the fools tell you lies.
while they hold you close, and say goodbyes.
Your kind of pride they did never have.

Don't let the blues make you bad.
Oh. Don't let the blues make you bad.
