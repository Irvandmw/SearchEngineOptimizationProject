Lyrics:


She was my once in a lifetime
Happy ending come true
Oh I guess I should have told her
But I thought she knew

She said I took her for granted
Last thing I would do
Oh I'll never understand it
'Cause I thought she knew

I thought she knew 
My world revolved around her
My love light burns for her alone
But she couldn't see the flame
Only myself to blame
I should have known
I should have known

A heart full of words left unspoken
Now that we're through
I'd sell my soul to have this silence broken
Oh I thought she knew
I thought she knew

I thought she knew
My world revolved around her
My love light burns for her alone
But she couldn't see the flame
Only myself to blame
I should have known
I should have known

She was my once in a lifetime
Happy ending come true
Oh I guess I should have told her
But I thought she knew
I thought she knew
I thought she knew
I thought she knew
I thought she knew
I thought she knew

Whoa....
Oh I thought that she knew
Yeah oooooooo....
