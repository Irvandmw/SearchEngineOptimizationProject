Lyrics:


I like your brother, I like your mother
And I like you, and you like me too
You get a preacher, I'll get a ring
We'll hire a band with an accordian, a violin
And a tenor who can sing

You and me, you and me baby, you and me
You and me, you and me baby, you and me
You and me, you and me baby, you and me
You and me, you and me baby

We'll have a kid or maybe we'll rent one
He's got to be straight, we don't want a bent one
He'll drink his baby brew from a big brass cup
Someday he might be president, if thing's loosen up

You and me, you and me baby, you and me
You and me, you and me baby, you and me
You and me, you and me baby, you and me
You and me, you and me baby

I'll take a train into the city every mornin'
You may be plain, but I think you're pretty in the mornin'
Some nights we'll go out dancin'
If I am not to tired
Some nights we'll spend romancin'
Watchin' the late show by the fire
