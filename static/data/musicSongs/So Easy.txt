Lyrics:


Like a fall leaf
From a tall tree
Landing on the grass
Like the white sand
Turns the clock hand
In an hourglass
You're the reason
I believe in
Something I don't know

You make it so, you make it so
You make it so easy
This letting go is so beautiful
'Cause you make it so easy
To fall so hard, to fall so hard

Like the ocean
Pulls the tide in
Just to hold it close
Like the rain pour
In a rainstorm
Makes the flowers grow
You're the reason
I believe in
Something I don't know

You make it so, you make it so
You make it so easy
This letting go is so beautiful
'Cause you make it so easy
To fall so hard, oh, oh, oh

You make it so, you make it so
You make it so easy, no

You make it so, you make it so
You make it so easy
This letting go is so beautiful
'Cause you make it so easy
To fall so hard, oh, oh, oh

You're the reason
I believe in
Something I don't know
