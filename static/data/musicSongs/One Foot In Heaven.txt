Lyrics:


One foot in heaven when you hold me sweet
One foot in heaven right on angel street
We're in a great way gee but it's nice
Standing in the gateway to paradise

One foot in heaven on the golden stair
And with the other one I walk on air
Maybe just beginner's luck but angel I've got winner's luck
'cause I have you

One foot in heaven when you hold me sweet
One foot in heaven right on angel street
We're in a great way gee but it's nice
Standing in the gateway to paradise

One foot in heaven on the golden stair
And with the other one I walk on air
Maybe just beginner's luck but angel I've got winner's luck
'cause I have you
