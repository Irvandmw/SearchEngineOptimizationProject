Lyrics:


The sandman told me he's done all he can
The situation needs a brand new plan
You've been cryin' all night long
Tossin' and turnin', it's almost dawn

So here I am, I'll help you if I can
Count on me, just take my hand
Close your eyes, leave the rest to me

And you'll have
Sweet dreams that'll last all night
An easy feeling in the mornin' light
Drift away with the touch of my hand
I'm your sleep tight, goodnight man

Soft an' soothin' like a lullaby
I'll kiss the tears from your weary eyes
In the mornin' you will understand
You've been touched by the goodnight man

I'll rock you gently like a rollin' wave
Hold you in my arms until you drift away
Just lay back, and leave the rest to me
And you'll have
Sweet dreams that'll last all night
An easy feeling in the mornin' light
Drift away with the touch of my hand
I'm your sleep tight, goodnight man

I'll rock you gently like a rollin' wave
Hold you in my arms until you drift away
Just lay back, and leave the rest to me
And you'll have
Sweet dreams that'll last all night
An easy feeling in the mornin' light
Drift away with the touch of my hand
I'm your sleep tight, goodnight man
Your sleep tight, goodnight man
I'm your sleep tight, goodnight man
