Lyrics:


My lover don't mind if
I follow him 'round
I'm high as a kite when I'm with him
All of the time

He gives me the holiday I needed all the time
Maybe this is temporary I don't even mind
Now I don't hate California after all
Now I don't hate California after all

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
Ooh, ooh

I know that he noticed
I follow him 'round
He's all kinds of hardness and heartless
But I know he's down

He gives me the holiday I needed all the time
Maybe this is temporary I don't even mind
Now I don't hate California after all
Now I don't hate California after all

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
Ooh, ooh

I just wanna stay
Another night, another day
We could wash the world away
We could play like children play

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
Ooh, ooh

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
