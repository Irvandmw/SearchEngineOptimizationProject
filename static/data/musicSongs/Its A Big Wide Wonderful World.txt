Lyrics:


It's a big wide wonderful world
When you're in love you're a master
Of all your survey you're a gay Santa Claus
There's a brave new star-spangled sky above you
When you're in love you're a hero
A Nero a Poirot a Wizard of Oz

You've a kingdom power and glory the old old oldest of stories
Here's new true you'll build your Rome in just one day
Life is mystic a mid-summer's night you live in
A Turkish delight you're in heaven
It's swell when you're really in love
It's swell when you're really in love
