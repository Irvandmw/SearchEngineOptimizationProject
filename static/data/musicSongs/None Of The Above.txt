Lyrics:


Everybody's fucked up off the beat
The words are in our mouths, but we don't speak
Boarded up the windows in the house
Another generation bleeding out

Don't want no part of this, none of the above
I don't want no part of this, none of the above
I don't want no

Take me to church
Cause I've been blessed with a curse
I arrived in a limo and I left in a hearse
They're speaking in tongues
Feels like we're coming undone
Don't want no part of this, none of the above

(N.O.N.E. of the A.B.O.V.E.)
(N.O.N.E. of the A.B.O.V.E.)

Blocking out the static in our heads
We are still alive and playing dead
We don't need a reason for our doubts
Another generation screaming out

Don't want no part of this, none of the above
None of the above

Take me to church
Cause I've been blessed with a curse
I arrived in a limo and I left in a hearse
They're speaking in tongues
Feels like we're coming undone
Don't want no part of this, none of the above

(N.O.N.E. of the A.B.O.V.E.)
(N.O.N.E. of the A.B.O.V.E.)

Don't want no part of this, none of the above

Take me to church
Cause I've been blessed with a curse
I arrived in a limo and I left in a hearse
They're speaking in tongues
Feels like we're coming undone
Don't want no part of this, none of the above

(N.O.N.E. of the A.B.O.V.E.)
None of the above
(N.O.N.E. of the A.B.O.V.E.)
