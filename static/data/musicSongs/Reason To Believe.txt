Song Name: Reason To Believe
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


If I listen long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe it's all true
Knowing that you lie straight faced, while I cry
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe

Someone like you makes it hard
To live without somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Everything of myself

If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way and I'd leave the past behind
Knowing that you lie straight faced, while I cry
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe

Someone like you makes it hard
To live without somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Everything of myself
