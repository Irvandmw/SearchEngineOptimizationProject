Lyrics:


When you get right down to with it
Isn't this moment what it's all about, boy?
Oh, when you get right down to with it
Don't you just feel this moment says everything?

Holding you, touching you
And I need a whole life time to do everything
That I wanna do for you, to you, what I want to with you, oho

When you get right down to with it
Doesn't this moment wash away all bad times?
When you get right down with it
Doesn't all the hurt you ever felt disappear?

Holding you, touching you
And I know that this magic just can't last forever

When you get right down to with
Don't you wanna relive this moment
Again and again and again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again and again and again?

Oh, holding you, touching you
And I know that the magic just can't last forever

When you get right down with
Don't you wanna relive this moment
Again and again and again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again and again and again?

Over and over, over and over, over and over, over and over
Again, babe, and again
Come on, come on, get down with me, baby
Get down with me, baby

I wonder if you'll get down with me, baby
Get down with me, baby
Get down with me, baby
Come on, get down with me, baby

Something to me one more time, get down with me, baby
Oh, get down with me, baby
Oh, get down with me, baby
Oh, get down with me, baby

Come on, get down with me, baby
Down with me baby, suck it to me
Get down with me baby, hey
Get down with me baby, turn me on, down with me baby, oh

Suck it to me, baby, oh

Suck it to me, baby, yeah
Suck it to me, baby
