Lyrics:


Heartaches, bitter tears that blind you as they fall
Heartaches, no one there to hear you when you call
And only the young, the young in love can really know

Bad news, broken heart each time you see her face
Bad news, tender lips that no one can replace
And only the young, the young in love can really know
Only the young, the young in love can really know

Love that comes for the first time is sweeter than rain
Love that hurts the fist time will rack you with pain
And only the young, the young in love can really know

Whoa whoa, some day, I'll get used to knowin' we're apart
Hmm, some day, I can hide this ache within my heart
And only the young, the young in love can really know
Only the young, the young in love can really know
And only the young, the young in love can really know
