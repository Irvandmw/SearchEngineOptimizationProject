Lyrics:


I looked under every rock and under every moon
I looked in every favourite spot
I looked in all of my favourite tunes
I looked all over the world
What else was I supposed to do?

No matter where I find myself
I find myself looking for you

The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you

Some say love is blindness
Some say God is love
Some say love is kindness
Well, it's all of the above
I hope there's a life after death
'Cause there's so much left here I wanna do

Yeah, no matter how I find myself
I find myself looking for you

The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you

When I was 12 years old
And undergoing so many changes
Emotionally out of control
Hair coming out of new places
I started feeling myself
What else is a boy to do?

And no matter when I found myself
I define myself looking for you

The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
