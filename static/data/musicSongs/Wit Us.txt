Lyrics:


Yee, yee
Bitch wanna fuck when I met her
Gucci and diamond, I met her
If you is cold get a sweater
I don't respond to yo' letters
I cannot fuck with you niggas
Don't try and flex when you wit us
We on that goal when you wit us
Yo bitch on my dick when she wetter

Yee, these niggas want me, me so bad
Every nigga in this thing switch up so fast, yah
I won't go a day without blowin' on that gas
A nigga on that fake shit, know dat shit don't last, yah
Come on baby girl, come and ride wit me
Mosey love nobody so please don't get attached to me
Unless you throwing it you can't come and ride wit me
Cause hoes ain't shit and I'ma take yo' bitch, yah
Leanin' off the Actavis, I swear you a activist
Yah, hella money, yah yah, hella money, aye
Pour up a four, now niggas goin' dumby
Don't hit up my phone if you ain't talkin bout that money
Like what you tryna do? You can't roll with me
So you can go back to what you do, say
I'ma roll with crew, you know that ain't new
Now I'm on that new shit, now homie what it do? Yah yah

Yee, yee
Bitch wanna fuck when I met her
Gucci and diamond, I met her
If you is cold get a sweater
I don't respond to yo' letters
I cannot fuck with you niggas
Don't try and flex when you wit us
We on that goal when you wit us
Yo bitch on my dick when she wetter

Yo bitch on my dick when I met her
You know she a groupie, you let her
Walk out the crib when I met her
In love with the game she better
Just drop a half on my wood, please get off I'm good
Be awake for good, if you want me, you should
I don't show no love, why you mad at me?
We ain't sayin' that and I fuckin' guaruntee
If sober never dropped, you want same bands on me
I know you agree so don't try come at me like
"What happen to you? Mosey actin' brand new"
Still got the same damn revenue
My fans be gone by two, so now what it do?
Got big bro's in a jam, you know they gon' shoot, yah yah

Yee, yee
Bitch wanna fuck when I met her
Gucci and diamond, I met her
If you is cold get a sweater
I don't respond to yo' letters
I cannot fuck with you niggas
Don't try and flex when you wit us
We on that goal when you wit us
Yo bitch on my dick when she wetter

Yee, yee
Bitch wanna fuck when I met her
Gucci and diamond, I met her
If you is cold get a sweater
I don't respond to yo' letters
I cannot fuck with you niggas
Don't try and flex when you wit us
We on that goal when you wit us
Yo bitch on my dick when she wetter
