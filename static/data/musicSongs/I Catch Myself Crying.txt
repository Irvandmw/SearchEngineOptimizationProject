Lyrics:


It doesn't matter one way or another I say
But I'm lyin', I catch myself cryin'
There are fools, I was one, but it's over and done
And I'm tryin', but I catch myself cryin'

I catch myself wonderin' if you'll found somebody new
I catch myself wonderin' if you're wonderin' if I'll find somebody too

It doesn't matter one way or another I say
But I'm lyin', I catch myself cryin'
There are fools, I was one, but it's over and done
And I'm tryin', but I catch myself cryin'
I catch myself cryin'
