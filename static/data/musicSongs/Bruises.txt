Lyrics:


She tries to hide the bruises she says it wasnt him
But sometimes he looses his temper 
And again he'll come home and look for a fight
But she tells herself it's alright
She hopes someday it's alright

She doesn't tell anybody but everyone can tell
That there's something she's hiding, she hasn't been herself
But she still goes out everynightshe tells herself it's alright
She hopes someday it's alright...its alright..its alright..its alright

She has to make excuses for all of this abuse 
And it's sad the truth is shes scared of what he'll do
If she'd ever walk out of his life
So she tells herself it's alright
She hopes someday it's alright..it's alright..
It's alright...it's alright..it's alright...it's alright..

She sits and she waits its not getting any better 
It's never too late but she knows its now or never
She'll get up the strength to stand up to him tonight 
Cuz she knows that it's alright
