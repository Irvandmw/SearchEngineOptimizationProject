Lyrics:


Every day when the work is behind you
And the shop and the store put the lock on the door
Just get away where your worries won't find you
If you like, well I'll tell you more

Don't let the day get the better of you
When the evening comes there's so much to do
You better put on your best and wear a smile
Just come along with me awhile
'Cause I tell you

I know a place
where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go

At the door there's a man who will greet you
Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs
Soon I'm sure you'll be tappin' your feet
Because the beat is the greatest there

All round there are girls and boys
It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
You gotta come along right now
'Cause I tell you

I know a place
where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go

It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
You gotta come along right now
'Cause I tell you

I know a place
where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go

I know a place where we can go
I know a place where the lights are low
You're gonna love this place I know
I know a place where we can go
