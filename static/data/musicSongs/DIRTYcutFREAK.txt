Lyrics:


I am a dirtycutfreak, I said join my pow wow
Won't you be my soul pal?
Flyin like the birds, we ain't droppin no turds
We're freakin cause we're born to, can you feel the vibe?
You wanna dance to the beat, we won't drop you like a load
Because we're groupies
Now, P-Roach, we ain't close to evil
We hip hop freaks, just like the 3b's
People showing me trash, I can't get with that
My homie Will is bustin out, cause he's a freaked out cat
And I go on with the words like Billy Joe Bob
Auction me off just like a bicycle, just like a tricycle
I'll knock you on the ground, I'll hit you in the head
And you'll still be my friend, cause I'm a dirty cut freak

I am a dirtycutfreak, I said join my pow wow
Won't you be my soul pal?
Flyin like the birds, we ain't droppin no turds
We're freakin cause we're born to, can you feel the vibe?
You wanna dance to the beat, we won't drop you like a load
Because we're groupies
Now, P-Roach, we ain't close to evil
We hip hop freaks, just like the 3b's
People showing me trash, I can't get with that
My homie Will is bustin out, cause he's a freaked out cat

Because I'm living in the fourth dimension
Not paying attention to the fools around me
Cause I sling fat rhymes see, your head is bouncin up and down, all around
So high on life, your feet can't reach the ground
Our music's not for the weak at heart
Got the power from the flower, cause we never act hard
Just flowin on freakstyle, all the while
I will go thousands of miles just to make your booty smile
I give peace and love to all my peoples
That's down and all my brothers and sisters
Wanna give them a pound
I give peace, I give love to all my peoples
That's down and all my brothers and sisters
Wanna give them a pound

Yo, P-Roach are coming up the first stream
Thanks go to Onion Hardcore, cause I got it coming

I am a dirtycutfreak, I said join my pow wow
Won't you be my soul pal?
Flyin like the birds, we ain't droppin no turds
We're freakin cause we're born to, can you feel the vibe?
You wanna dance to the beat, we won't drop you like a load
