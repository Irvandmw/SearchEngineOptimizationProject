Lyrics:


Somewhere a party's going on
Someone's that should go home
But he's the life of the party so his friends won't let him go, oh no
He's having a real good time
Telling jokes and drinking wine
And if someone's waiting for him you never know

But home she's looking out the window
Thinking about the good times she remembers
Holding back the tears and wishing he was safe at home
Inside her two loving arms, sure do miss him
Two lips that long to kiss him
Once more whisper "baby I love you"

Back at the party, he's all smiles
And his mind is a million miles
From the woman who keeps on loving him more and more
One more dance, a little more wine
He's not too worried about the time
Cause he knows she'll be waiting there at the door

But home she's looking out the window
Thinking about the good times she remembers
Holding back the tears and wishing he was safe at home
Outside, she sees the car lights
She hears the door and knows he's alright
And though he's been a million places
She never looks for lipstick traces

And in her heart, she knows he's wrong
But she's so glad to have him home
Once more she whispers
As the tears fall down she whispers
Once more she whispers "I love you"
