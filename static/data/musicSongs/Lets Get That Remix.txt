[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Uuuhh!
I think it's only right till we hit 'em with some H-Town "Ammunition". [gun-cocks]
Chamillionaire...
Doughbeezy, Marcus Manchild! [automatic gunshots]
They say we ain't got it like that, so you know what?!
LET'S GET IT! [shot]

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
Just give it to homes in different locations,
Just make one and leave the most spacious;
And two rollies dipped in gold faces,
And two girls that's known to switch places!
Ready? Let's get that!
Let's get that! - Let's go!
Lemme know if you with that!
You with that? - Let's go!

Just give me two yellow bones with cute faces,
Gotta be backin' up or be basic!
TV screens is looking like "Matrix",
Cars so fast, the police can't chase it!
Ready? Let's get that!
Let's get that! - Let's go!
Lemme know if you with that!
You with that? - Let's go, we can get it now!

[Chamillionaire:]
Let's go! Got tired of waitin', got tired of hopin'!
I'm a chain, so icey, you can ride the sloap an'
I'll extend the swing if they ridin' pokin'
And the pencil wet, I'm feelin' like I'm floatin'!
You can mention 'em, but they are not as dope
If somebody lie then, somebody jokin'!
And they tellin' y'all that they got it locked
We tell 'em then that we 'bout to come and pry it open! (whooo!)
And then they all can have it; none of y'all can have it!
She takin'-off-her-shirt, want me to autograph it!
So I autograph it, let me autograph it!
Your-woman-disappearin' you can call it "magic".
See? It's automatic cause it's all established
I'm-the-Texas-rapper-that-you-know-it's-far-from-average!
I'm-the-rapper-that-these-other-rappers-call "the-baddest"!
Been-the-baddest-since-the-day-I-went-and-bought-a-tablet!
Get-a-chicken-then-another-chicken-come-in-the-mail (mail!)
Your-woman-beggin'-me-to-come-and-rub-on-her-tail! (tail!)
I-never-cared-about-a-cover-of-the-XXL, (XL!)
Then-every-record, I'm a-get-a-bigger-tuck-in-my-sales! (tuck-in-my-sales!)
I'm the boss yo' boss should get pissed at!
I'm a take it all my weapon, go click-clack! [gun cocks]
See? I want it all and that should be gift wrapped;
Enough with the talk in Texas, let's get that!

[Chorus: Chamillionaire (Doughbeezy)]
Just give it to homes in different locations,
Just make one and leave the most spacious;
And two rollies dipped in gold faces,
And two girls that's known to switch places!
Ready? Let's get that!
Let's get that! - Let's go!
Lemme know if you with that!
You with that? - Let's go!

Just give me two yellow bones with cute faces,
Gotta be backin' up or be basic!
TV screens is looking like "Matrix",
Cars so fast, the police can't chase it!
Ready? Let's get that!
Let's get that! - Let's go!
Lemme know if you with that! (Doughbeezy!)
You with that? - Let's go, we can get it now! (HUUUH?!)

[Doughbeezy:]
Let's G-O, get it?
My grind got me blind on C-note niggas!
It's-the-colored-chandeliers or it's the South-East beast,
So we leave 'em boys pissed like a P.O. visit! (OOWW!)
Your-money-like-a-midget, mine tall like a giant;
I used to get mad cause I couldn't get fly.
Now-when-I-say-I-fly, I-really-mean-that-I'm-fly, (fly!)
Couldn't-pay-my-light-bill, now show's outta liiiine!
Yeah! - If-you-with-it, I'm-with-it!
I'm-down-to-go-get-it-this-minute, right-now! (now!)
I don't care who did it or done it, I need it!
I want it; fuck next! I'm the nigga right now!
I'm-comin'-up-quick, got-'em-lookin'-like: "How?! " (how!)
But-I'm-lookin'-right-back-like: "Nigga, fuck you! "
I-dropped-my-mixtape-and-the-next-day
Did-a-song-with-a-nigga-I-look-up-to! (LET'S GO!)
Scream droppin' like pantyhose; give-the-niggas-toothpaste-from-the-candy-dolls!
Even-in-2020 ('20!) my-rims-still-gonna-be-from-1984. (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, that's the Texas tank and I'm the Texas Chain-...
... -Saw, I murder beast, no paces!
Fuck bein' local, I want the whole nation;
So when I sign my deal, - I'm a tell the label...

[Chorus: Chamillionaire (Doughbeezy) {Marcus Manchild}]
Just give it to homes in different locations, (Doughbeezy!)
Just make one and leave the most spacious; (yeah!)
And two rollies dipped in gold faces,
And two girls that's known to switch places!
Ready? Let's get that!
Let's get that! - Let's go!
Lemme know if you with that!
You with that? - Let's go!

Just give me two yellow bones with cute faces,
Gotta be backin' up or be basic!
TV screens is looking like "Matrix",
Cars so fast, the police can't chase it!
Ready? Let's get that! {let's get that!}
Let's get that! - Let's go! {let's get that!}
Lemme know if you with that! {Chamillionaire! whattup, homie?}
You with that? - Let's go! {yeah!}

[Marcus Manchild:]
Okay, we can get it now! - Hop-on-a-record-then I'm flippin' out; (uh-huh!)
I-want-every-bitch-to-approach-me-with-their-motherfuckin'-titties-out (uhh!)
Because-a-nigga-wanna-feel-'em-out, (uhh!) that's I'm dealin' out! (uh-huh!)
I-wanna-know-what-you-kids-about; (uhh!) - but-never-take-'em-to-the biggest house (uhh!)
I-pull-up-at-the-garage-in-the-car, the-top-back-gettin'-down, vroom-vroom!
And-I'm-peeling-out-like: "What-you-know-about-it? "
What? - I'm sippin' purple! (purple!) - Wanna-get-rich-off-of the work-flow! (workflow!)
And I speed it up like Turbo, (g'eah!) got-up-in-the-game, fell-in-love-with-some-Virgos.
Two friends beside you, you know I'm-finna-hit-'em! (hit 'em!)
Pull 'em to the side, yeah! You know I'm-finna-get-'em! (get 'em!)
Cause-I'm-all-about-my-spinnin', mucher (yeah!) than-my (yeah!) mozzarella (yeah!)
Martadein, (yeah!) yeah! (yeah!) They-wanna-be (yeah!) the-part-of-that.
Walked-in 'bout to me because I'm space-God (space-God!)
With a pocket-full-of bank cards, like I play cards (hahaha!) but I ain't play y'all!
And they tell me a nigga finna take off (take off!) - to the labels that I'm WITH THAT (WITH THAT!)
With the car I like I FIT THAT (FIT THAT!) - Cut the check, muhfucka; let's get that! (GET THAT!) (bwooy!)

[Chorus: without ab-libs]

[Outro: Chamillionaire]
You know these clowns won't be over here to keep H-Town dooown.
Somebody better let 'em KNOW...
Die slow! [shot] [beat stops]
