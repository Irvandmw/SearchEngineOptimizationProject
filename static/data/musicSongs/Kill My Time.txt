Lyrics:


Wildflower, fingertips on me
I can feel them still
Stained hearts trying to find a home
Looking for something real

I said meet me downtown at the dive bar
You're the only one that makes me feel alive
I can't keep drowning in the shadows
Here I am lay it all on the line
Meet me downtown at the dive bar
You're the only one that makes me feel alive
I can't keep drowning in the shadows
You're the only one that matters

I don't wanna kill my time with somebody else
Dancing in the dark till the sun comes
Tangled in the sheets till the day's done
I don't wanna kill my time with somebody else
In a city full of lonely people 
I just want you all to myself

He's only got half of your heart
'Cause I've got the other part
Why don't you just say goodbye now?
It's only a matter of time now
Take you on a desert drive
We can leave it all tonight
Why don't you say goodbye now?
It's only a matter of time now

I said meet me downtown at the dive bar
You're the only one that makes me feel alive
I can't keep drowning in the shadows
Here I am lay it all on the line
Meet me downtown at the dive bar
You're the only one that makes me feel alive
I can't keep drowning in the shadows
You're the only one that matters

I don't wanna kill my time with somebody else
Dancing in the dark till the sun comes
Tangled in the sheets till the day's done
I don't wanna kill my time with somebody else
In a city full of lonely people 
I just want you all to myself

Wildflower, fingertips on me
I can feel them still
Stained hearts trying to find a home
Looking for something real

I don't wanna kill my time with somebody else
Dancing in the dark till the sun comes
Tangled in the sheets till the day's done
I don't wanna kill my time with somebody else
In a city full of lonely people 
I just want you all to myself
