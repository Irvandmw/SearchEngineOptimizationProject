Lyrics:


This is making me crazy 
These black clouds following me 
So I look for signs of light 
But rarely I see them 

I return to my shelter 
And I crawl in a bottle 
I'm losing my will for this 
So over emotional 

Black clouds 
They rain down but 
They can't kill the sun 

Confession of depression 
This life I'm second-guessing 
Like ashes to ashes 
I always seem to fall down 
I'm tired of running 
It's time to face my demons 
Confession of depression 
This life I'm second-guessing 

My emotions are storming 
And tears fall just like rain 
Pain strikes like lightning 
Despair is becoming my friend 

I'm pushing myself to a point of self-destruction 

Black clouds 
They rain down but 
They can't kill the son inside
