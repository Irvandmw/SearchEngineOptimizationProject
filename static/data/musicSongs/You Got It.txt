Lyrics:


Oh, oh, oh..right now baby
Soon as the stars shine
I'm gonna make you mine
Oh baby...

You got it 
I want it
I'll do whatever it takes
You got it 
I need it
Your love is what makes my heart break 

Let me tell you how I feel
I need your lovin'
Girl give it to me
Never met a girl like you
I know you'll like 
The crazy things we'll do 

Walking slowly through the rain
Without worries there's no pain
When you see a shooting star
All your problems seem so far
If you feel true love and trust
Girl just give me all you got 
Cause girl you got the love I need 

You got it 
I want it
I'll do whatever it takes
You got it 
I need it
Your love is what makes my heart break 

You got it, you got it...badadada..

You are in my dreams at night
Whatever I do you're always on my mind
I can't wait until the day
When you and me are one in love to stay 

Walking slowly through the rain
Without worries there's no pain
When you see a shooting star
All your problems seem so far
If you feel true love and trust
Girl just give me all you got
Girl you got the love I need 

You got it 
I want it
I'll do whatever it takes
You got it 
I need it
Your love is what makes my heart break 

oooh...waa...ooohh...ahhhhhhh
You got it

You got it 
I want it
I'll do whatever it takes
You got it 
I need it
Your love is what makes my heart break 

Just give me all your love
I got to have all your love 

Just give me all your love
(Cause your love is what makes my heart break)
got to have all your love 

Just give me all your love
I got to have all your love 

Just give me all your love
Cause I got what you need baby 
Got to have all your love 

You got it 
I want it
I'll do whatever it takes (Cause I have got to have all your love baby)
You got it 
I need it
Your love is what makes my heart break
Give me your love..
