Lyrics:


When July comes
The summer won't be long
When July comes
You're older than you think
When July comes
The winter's on its way
It may seem like it's summer
But it's not gonna last
It may seem like it's summer
But summer goes so fast
When July comes

If you love me
I can make it through the year
I can make it through the cold and rain
If you love me
I can make it till it's spring again

When you love me
You're much warmer than the spring
You're much warmer than this summer sky
When you love me
I can make it till the clouds go by

Then when July comes
I'll have you beneath the sun
When July comes
We'll wonder on the beach
When July comes
The sand is sticky hot
It will always be summer
The sun will burn our skin
It will always be summer
The waves come crashing in
When July comes
It will always be summer
The sun will burn our skin
It will always be summer
The waves come crashing in
When July comes
