Lyrics:


Somedays I Iook in the mirror and I think
The meanest things, all the meanest things
Somedays I'm holding my self-worth up
By a string, a string

But every day that I don't hide myself away
To me, is a tiny victory

Some days it feels like a wreckin' ball swinging
Through my ribcage, my ribcage
Some nights I'm just a million broken pieces
Singing on a stage

I'm little more broken open but a little more free
And that's a tiny victory

And if battles can win a war
I can keep pickin' my sword up off the floor
And learn to treasure these
Tiny victories
Tiny victories

Some days givin' up on myself looks so
So easy to do, it's so easy to do
The struggle is slow, I'm barely movin' the needle
And the cracks may be few
But there's light coming through

And if battles can win a war
I can keep pickin' my sword up off the floor
And learn to treasure these
Tiny victories
Tiny victories
Tiny victories
Tiny victories

Every day that I don't hide myself away
Every day that I don't hide myself away
To me, is a tiny victory
