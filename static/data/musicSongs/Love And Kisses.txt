Lyrics:


Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Fulfill all of my wishes
That's all I gotta have to make my dreams come true

You took me by the hand and made me feel just like a man
And little chills ran up and down my spine
You made me love you through an' through
And when you kiss me like you do
It leaves me feelin' awful fine

I gotta have Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Fulfill all of my wishes
That's all I gotta have to make my dreams come true

Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Fulfill all of my wishes
That's all I gotta have to make my dreams come true

I never had a lot but if you take the things I got
I wouldn't care as long as I have you
You know I'll always try to be anything you ask of me
And this is all I want from you

I gotta have Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Fulfill all of my wishes
That's all I gotta have to make my dreams come true

Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Your love and kisses, aha-ha
Fulfill all of my wishes
That's all I gotta have to make my dreams come true
