Lyrics:


Hey, sugar
I know itâs been a minute
But I got to, I got to get up
Come on
Letâs talk about what you got

I donât think you understand
It makes me
Can I talk a lilâ bit, oh
Yeah

Baby, you got something that would make
A many brother mighty proud
I gotta say it loud (I got to say it loud)
You got a dozen little sexy tricks
That a dozen cities in this U.S. wonât, won't even allow
Never do you boast like the other chicks
Who think theyâre fine and loved, said loved the floor
And what I dig the most is that you keep it in your hand
Until I, until I, until I want it

If ever, whenever you need someone to take a shower with
Call me up please
Extra lovable, honey donât you wanna, donât you wanna
Take a bath with me?

Baby, you could turn anybody on, I wait my turn however long
Even if it takes eternity
Time can pass away but every day I make a play
Just hear you say the same about me
Baby, I know my rap is strong
Not as strong as your perfume
Thatâs ok, I like it
Not as much as I would like a chance to see you dancing naked
Oh, Iâd really want to see you dance

If ever, whenever you need someone to take a shower with
Call me up please
Extra lovable, honey donât you wanna, donât you wanna
Take a bath with me?

Sugar baby, youâre so fine
But see, you had me meet between the lines
Might be kinda popular but if you want, Iâm yours
You can ask what weâre gonna do
I think youâd better shut the door

You know what Iâm talking about, baby
Oh, let me hear you say
Come on
Scandalous

If ever, whenever you need someone to take a shower with
Call me up please
Extra lovable, honey donât you wanna, donât you wanna
Take a bath with me?
