Lyrics:


When you get dressed in the morning I never knew
That you would have your shirt off 5 in the afternoon
Baby when we're together you don't act like you're doing what you do
We parted aside before you came on so I'm tellin' you

Don't take your hat off (Hat off, hat off)
You can keep it on cause baby I'm done
Don't take your shoes off (Shoes off, shoes off)
Don't get comfortable cause we're outta time
You keep your pants down (Pants down, pants down)
You keep your pants down (Pants down, pants down)
You can hit the door now (Door now, door now)
Cause you got caught with your pants down

I say even no home no more
I wonder are you close outta my drawers
Looking you slick like I am fogged
But I don't know baby we been through this before
Baby I been more than good to you
When you leaving gimme my key back too
You got me
It's about to go down
Your, your other new lady
You're out there with your pants down

Don't take your hat off (Hat off, hat off)
Boy don't take it off cause baby I'm done
Don't take your shoes off (Shoes off, shoes off)
Don't get comfortable cause (Don't you get comfortable baby)
You keep your pants down (Pants down, pants down)
You keep your pants down (Pants down, pants down)
You can hit the door now (Door now, door now)
Cause you got caught with your pants down

[Mo'Nique:]
Hey, how you doing?
No, no your keys not broken
I changed the locks ah-hu
Yea you come on in
But no, I'ma need you to hurry up
And get all your stuff
Now everything inside the den that's yours
And the stuff in the bags that's yours
Your girls calling, hold on I'ma bout to lose right now
Have you lost your mothafucking
Let, let me just... what was you thinking baby?
I mean really what was you thinking?
See this ain't one of those "I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute"
I'm too damn grown for that
Cause see I really wanted you
All you had to do was take care of home
Now I'ma need you to hurry up
I got some chicken and spaghetti cookin' in the oven
Hat off, hat off, hat off (Of course)
Don't take your shoes off, shoes off, shoes off (But I love me)
You keep your pants down, pants down, pants down
You keep your pants down, pants down, pants down
You can hit the door now, door now, door now
Cause you got caught with your pants down

And leave my car keys...
