Lyrics:


Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I'm the best mother fucking rapper man you know
Aye
True story by the way...
Everything's a true story...

I had my mind on the milli'
I went and copped a Cuban that shine out of Philly
I went broke and sold her mad that I did it
Flew out to Cali got bags and sip it
Ever fall off get some change from a freak
We leavin' stains on the sheets
You might wanna change up yo keys
I got yo bitch name on a leash

She tryin' to send me the addy
She think Imma pull up and fuck her to sleep
I put this shit on the box now her grandma high because I sent her a P
I put my bitches to work
Ask her what you do for me
She like when I lift up her skirt
Bend her over we fuck on the scene

Her momma came knock on the door she said she gotta pee she had too much to drink
I had to hide in the shower and that's when I found out her momma a freak
She came and sat on the toilet and pulled out her phone but ain't lift up the seat
I saw her play with that pussy
Holding a picture of me

I had my mind on the milli'
I went and copped a Cuban that shine out of Philly
I went broke and sold her mad that I did it
Flew out to Cali got bags and sip it
Ever fall off get some change from a freak
We leavin' stains on the sheets
You might wanna change up yo keys
I got yo bitch name on a leash

I had a lil' hoe from the city she really with it stay down like a g
I gave her way to much salt now she fuck with a nigga that play in the league
I put a hoe through the most
I make a pretty bitch leave
I'm not even playin' with you
'Cause you ain't gonna be playin' with me
I used to fuck with a bitch that ain't even pay rent she be stayin' for free
I asked to pay a lil' bill she act like I asked her to jump in the sea
Like I told her go get a rope
Tie it around both yo feet
Tie up the rope to a brick
Bend you ass over and leave

I had my mind on the milli'
I went and copped a Cuban that shine out of Philly
I went broke and sold her mad that I did it
Flew out to Cali got bags and sip it
Ever fall off get some change from a freak
We leavin' stains on the sheets
You might wanna change up yo keys
I got yo bitch name on a leash
Yeah
