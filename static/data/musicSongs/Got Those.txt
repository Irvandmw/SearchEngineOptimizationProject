Lyrics:


All money ainât good money
But ainât no money like the show money

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we donât got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

I pull up in a Full Metal Jacket
Pop shots, Top notch with the ratchet
I leave a nigga dead on the asphalt
Slap em in the face tell em take them fuckinâ pants off
Tâd Up, Gâd Up when we stance off
Two to the chest make a bitch nigga dance off
Goinâ with the Wizzin, Juice with the Gizzinâ
Rides tilâ Iâm Risen, strong with the pizzen'
You donât know, oh, I fucked your hizzoe
Timbo, the Designer, and finer fuck what it cizzost
See everything Iâm rock and wear its handmade
If she with me then she got it all you understand me

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we donât got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

The police, motherfuckinâ gang to me
And money, ainât a motherfuckinâ thang to me
Let me break it down for you, keep a few shooters
And a damn good lawyer
Preparation for the worst, meditation with this verse
Education, Rebirth, cause you know if you last you first
And everybody wanna be the best, Red bottom shoes for your Louie bag on your neck
Baby remember before you had shoes
When yoâ life was filled with nothing but bad news
See everything I rock and wear is handmade
If she with me then she got it all you understand me

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we donât got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

New cars got that, good weed blow that
Bag bitch yessir, OG for sure that
Used to stay with my momma on the couch
Like the Jeffersons Iâm moving on up and Iâm out
Penthouse with the butler who waits by the door
To ensure Iâm the only motherfucker on this floor
I got game, I got fame, I got cash, I got love
I got so many hoes, Iâm bout to open a club
You got me, I got you,  you got one, I got two
Stop by and have a good time its poppingâ at Snoops
Got a whole lot of this and I mix it with that
Me and Timberland remember we bringinâ it back

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we donât got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those
