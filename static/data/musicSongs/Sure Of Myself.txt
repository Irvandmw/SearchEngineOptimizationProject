Lyrics:


I've lost my way
And day by day
Playing tough is hard enough
When the sun is out
Tougher, in rain

Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)

And if I've lost my way (how am I still here)
Still standing straight (how am I still here)
I'm looking up to find I'm tough
When the sun goes down
And I feel the change

Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)

Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reasons to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
And oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reasons to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself (yeah)
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Because when I was little I was so sure of myself

When I was little I was so sure of myself (yeah)
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
When I was little I was so sure of myself (oh)
