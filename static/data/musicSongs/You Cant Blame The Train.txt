Lyrics:


Well, I got crazy yesterday and I called her to say
Please baby won't you come home tonight
I can't even trust my brain to get my heart in from the rain
I know that girl's a hurricane, in her own right

Then early this mornin' after she was goin'
I sat there in my chair all alone
Well I called my friend cryin', and asked him why
That girl was always doing me so wrong

He said: "When the gates are all down and the signals are flashin'
The whistle is screamin' in vain
And you stay on the tracks, ignoring the facts
Well, you can't blame the wreck on the train
No, you can't blame the wreck on the train"

Well, how many times have I promised myself
Not to do the same thing as before
I swear I will leave it alone and believe it
Then I'll turn around and do it some more

Oh, fool me one time and it's shame on you
Fool me twice and it's shame on me
That's what my best friend warned me when I called him this mornin'
Then he reminded me

He said: "When the gates are all down and the signals are flashin'
The whistle is screamin' in vain
And you stay on the tracks, ignoring the facts
Well, you can't blame the wreck on the train
No, you can't blame the wreck on the train"

He said: "When the gates are all down and the signals are flashin'
And the whistle is screamin' in vain
And you stay on the tracks, ignoring the facts
Well, you can't blame the wreck on the train
No, you can't blame the wreck on the train
Man, you gotta quit blamin' the train"
