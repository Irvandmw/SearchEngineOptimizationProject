Lyrics:


Look into my big brown eyes
Tell me what's on your mind
Do you really love me?
Or do you just wanna make some time?
See, I don't really care
I just want a little company
I can tell by the look in your eyes
That you really, really want me

Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me, baby?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to be with me alone?
Wouldn't you love to have me for your very own?

I'm really not that hard to get
I only wanna make you see
That baby, I'm not ready yet
To give you every part of me
I don't want to tease you
I only wanna turn you on
I know I can please you, baby
'Til your rocks are gone
'Til all is gone

Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to be with me alone?
Wouldn't you love to have me for your very own?

Everybody singin'
Don't you wanna be with me alone?

Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me, baby?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me, baby?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to be with me alone?
Wouldn't you love to have me for your very own?

Tell me what's on your mind
Don't you want to be with me alone?
Don't you want to have me for your very own?
Wanna love me
I want you tonight 'til my blood sings

Wouldn't you love to be with me alone?
Wouldn't you love to have me for your very own?
I love you, you love me
My baby, don't you wanna love me?
