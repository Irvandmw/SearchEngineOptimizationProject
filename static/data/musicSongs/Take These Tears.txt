Lyrics:


I don't sleep in the night
I won't hold myself tight
Cause the thought of you gone doesn't feel right

I got lost in the moment 
Yeah you are my chosen
Don't ever let go 
Take these tears tonight

Oh yeah I'll take these tears and throw them all away
Tell me I'm wrong 
Tell me that it's okay 
Cause I don't wanna feel 
The bonds we share to break
I'll gather up all your love 
And lock it away

Tell me what was I to say 
When you up and walked away
How can I hide all these things I hate

I don't sleep in the night
I won't hold myself tight
Cause the thought of you gone doesn't feel right

I got lost in the moment 
Yeah you are my chosen
Don't ever let go 
Take these tears tonight

So Imma take these tears 
And wipe them all away
Cause no I don't want, 
Don't want to be sad today
I'll turn it all around 
I'll take it down, down, down,
Do what I gotta do 
To stand up to you

Tell me what was I to say 
When you up and walked away
How can I hide all these things I hate

I don't sleep in the night
I won't hold myself tight
Cause the thought of you gone doesn't feel right

I got lost in the moment 
Yeah you are my chosen
Don't ever let go 
Take these tears tonight

Imma take all of these tears 
And I'll throw them all away
No you won't be see in them 
No not till that rainy day
I won't be that lonely girl 
I will be that rising son
You can take me as I am
Won't come back you see I'm done

Tell me what was I to say 
When you up and walked away
How can I hide all these things I hate

I don't sleep in the night
I won't hold myself tight
Cause the thought of you gone doesn't feel right

I got lost in the moment 
Yeah you are my chosen
Don't ever let go 
Take these tears tonight

I don't sleep in the night
I won't hold myself tight
Cause the thought of you gone doesn't feel right

I got lost in the moment 
Yeah you are my chosen
Don't ever let go 
Take these tears tonight
