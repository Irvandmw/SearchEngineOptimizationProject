Lyrics:


I'm ready for you
And girl, you better feel the same
Take a shower and change
Girl, I'll be in the bed waiting (yeah, yeah)
Girl, kick off your shoes, be a masseuse
And feel my fingers
All on your body and through your hair
Ain't 'bout to start complainin', love it when you rainin'
Pussy popping, we be fucking everywhere

Make sure you call me when you get off
When you get to my crib, take that shit off
I know that we gon' get fucked up, girl, this the last call
For love and alcohol
You better show your ass up, yay yay

I'm tryna fuck you in the middle of the night
1 AM, 2 AM, second round, three, four, five
I wanna do all the freaky shit that you like, baby
I'ma fuck you right, make sure you call me when you get off

I know that you tired, I don't really care
'Cause I know that pussy by, baby, bring it here
I wanna put my tongue where your thong is
Baby, as long as you just give me both lips
Who yo' daddy?
When I hit it, look back at me
Snackin' then I'm smackin'
Smashin', blastin', 'cause I know your booty ain't plastic
Ooh, look at you, you the baddest
I'ma hit it like a nigga never had it
Really don't like static but I need love
When we do the nasty, you smilin'

Make sure you call me when you get off
When you get to my crib, take that shit off
I know that we gon' get fucked up, girl, this the last call
For love and alcohol
You better show your ass up, yay yay

I'm tryna fuck you in the middle of the night
1 AM, 2 AM, second round, three, four, five
I wanna do all the freaky shit that you like, baby
I'ma fuck you right, make sure you call me when you get off

Call me when you're about to get off
You better show up
No one's talkin'
I'm tired of stalkin' you
I might sound like I'm crazy and wild
'Cause I just wanna lay with you
Fuckin' it up and I cuddle with you
Had a long day, you're 'bout to have a long night
You ain't gon' get no sleep, girl
But you'll be alright

I'm tryna fuck you in the middle of the night
1 AM, 2 AM, second round, three, four, five
I wanna do all the freaky shit that you like, baby
I'ma fuck you right, make sure you call me when you get off

Call me when you get off
Make sure you call me when you get off
Call me when you get off
Make sure you call me when you get off
