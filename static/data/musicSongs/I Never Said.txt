Lyrics:


I'm alone in the place
We called a home
Every room
Lies silent and cold
Late in the night
Going round in my head
Are the words I never said

I never knew you were hurting inside
I can still hear your voice like an echoing cry
I stumble and fall hands to my head
Cry out the words I never said

For everything you are
I should have thanked you
For every tender touch
I should have held you
Told you I loved you
With every beat of my heart

I close my eyes walk through my mind
Searching the past of a happier time
Turn off the light laying on my bed
I hear the words I never said

For everything you are
I should have thanked you
For every tender touch
I should have held you
Told you I loved you
With every beat of my heart
(My heart, my heart)

These are the words I never said
I'm sorry, got trapped in my head
(My head, my head)

These are the words I never said
I'm sorry, got trapped in my head
