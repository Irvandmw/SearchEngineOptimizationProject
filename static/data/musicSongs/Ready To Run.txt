Lyrics:


Boots on the ground
Had enough of this clown
No, I won't stay 'round
Catch a bus, Greyhound
No, I'm not gawkin' back
Turn around, it's a trap
I ain't fallin' for your charm
Put a lock on my heart

Ready to run
Ready to run
Ready to run
Pack up I run and ride, no shade it's tired
So I'm ready to run

I'm goin' to a safer place for livin'
I'm runnin', kickin', never scared of screamin'
It's hateful here and don't nobody care, I'm shoutin'
Why's everybody being savage round here?

Ready to run
Ready to run
Ready to run
Pack up I run and ride, no shade it's tired
So I'm ready to run
Run
Ready to run

Been down on my knees
Got back up to crawl all over
No more aiming to please
Now that I'm on my feet
I'mma walk, I'mma walk, I'mma walk to the edge, yeah
I'mma run, I'mma run, I'm catching the air
Ain't no slowin' down from here
Ain't no room for shackles, dear
Try to catch up if you dare

Ready to run
Ready to run
Ready to run
Pack up I run and ride, no shade it's tired
So I'm ready to run
Run, yeah
Ready to run

Ready to run
