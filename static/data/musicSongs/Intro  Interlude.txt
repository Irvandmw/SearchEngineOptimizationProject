Lyrics:


Baby loves, I'm tryna talk to you
There's a boy
And I don't quite know
What to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me, shows me, he's the one
For sure the one
I think I'd rather wait for him forever
Instead of having him just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's looking at it too
And I don't know what to do
