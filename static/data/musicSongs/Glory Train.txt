Lyrics:


I want to ride that glory train
I want to ride, ride, ride that glory train
Yes, all I want to do
When my life on earth is through
Is to get aboard and ride that glory train

Ah, there's a ralroad train that's leavin'
Just rolling down the track
And the passengers aboard it boy
They're never coming back
It's a glory train that's leaving
It's the train I long to ride
To that home way up in heaven
Where God's children all abide

I want to ride that glory train
I want to ride, ride, ride that glory train
Yes, all I want to do
When my life on earth is through
Is to get aboard and ride that glory train

Hear the thunder of engine
Get aboard her if you can
For the final destination
Is that far off promised land
Where the master will be waiting
In his home way up above
Just to fill our hearts with gladness
And his great eternal love

I want to ride that glory train
I want to ride, ride, ride that glory train
Yes, all I want to do
When my life on earth is through
Is to get aboard and ride that glory train

When you get down to the station
And the train's about to leave
You be sure to have a ticket
If you really do believe
That the Master's waiting for you
In his home way up above
Just to fill our hearts with gladness
And his great eternal love

I want to ride that glory train
I want to ride, ride, ride that glory train
Yes, all I want to do
When my life on earth is through
Is to get aboard and ride that glory train
Oh that glory train
Yes, that glory train
