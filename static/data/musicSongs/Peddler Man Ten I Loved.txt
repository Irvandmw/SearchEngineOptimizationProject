Lyrics:


(Peddler Man, Peddler Man)

Come along ladies look and buy
Come along ladies don't be shy
Ladies, ladies here's the peddler man

I'm just a poor but honest peddler
I got a wagon and a donkey
If you need pots, I've got lots
Need a hat, I've got that
Take your time, I've got time

I'm still in my prime Peddler Man
Ten I love, nine I've forgot
Giddiup donkey, one more mile
Giddiup donkey, stop awhile
What a lot of pretty girls I've met

Ten I love, nine I forgot
Giddiup donkey, don't be slow
Giddiup donkey, home we go
To the only one I can't forget (Peddler Man, Peddler Man)
I like to hear the daughters calling
Oh mama mama here's the peddler man
You want a gown blue or brown
Want some hose, I've got those
Look and buy, don't be shy
I can satisfy (Peddler Man, Peddler Man)

(Ten he loved, nine he forgot)
Giddiup donkey one more mile
Giddiup donkey stop awhile
What a lot of pretty girls I've met

Ten I loved, nine I forgot
Giddiup donkey don't be slow
Giddiup donkey home we go
To the only one I can't forget (Peddler Man, Peddler Man)
