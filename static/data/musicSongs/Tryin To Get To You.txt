Lyrics:


I've been travelin' over mountains
Even through the valley's too
I've been travelin' night and day
Runnin' all the way
Baby tryin' to get to you

Ever since I read your letters
Where you said you loved me true
I've been travelin' night and day
Runnin' all the way
Baby tryin' to get to you

When I read your lovin' letters
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us
But they didn't mean a thing

I just had to reach you baby
'Spite of all that I've been through
I kept travelin' night and day
Runnin' all the way
Baby tryin' to get to you

When I read your lovin' letters
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us
But they didn't mean a thing

I just had to reach you baby
'Spite of all that I've been through
I kept travelin' night and day
Runnin' all the way
Baby tryin' to get to you

I kept travelin' night and day
Runnin' all the way
Baby tryin' to get to you
