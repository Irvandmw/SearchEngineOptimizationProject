Lyrics:


Some dreams, they turn out unfamiliar
Some days are riddled with regret
And even when you think it's over
You ain't seen nothing yet

No we can't hold out on love
No we can't hold out on love
Because it's up to us to make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love

Some nights it feels my bones are empty
Some things are too hard to explain
Some times i look at you with envy
And then i see we're both the same

So we can't hold out on love
No we can't hold out on love
Because it's up to us to make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love
Oh, we can't hold out on love

All we want, all we need
Is inside you and me
We're all alike, all the while
Everybody breathes
All because all the love
Echoes in the beating
Of our hearts
Let's get started

You can't hold out on love
No we can't hold out on love
'Cause it's up to us
To make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love
No, we can't hold out on love
No, we can't hold out on love
'Cause it's up to us
To make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love
Oh, we can't hold out on love
'Cause it's up to us
To make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love
