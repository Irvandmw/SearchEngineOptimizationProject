Lyrics:


There is something about you baby
I keep thinking why should I care
âCause Iâm a denier of damage suppliers
Surrounding me everywhere

So I try not to smile but I fail
I am going to leave but I stay
Invisible hands
changing my plans
Knowing the end of the day

[Chorus:]
Icebreaker take me higher
Just hold your warm body next to mine
Keep setting me on fire
And donât tell me love is blind

I am playing somebodyâs role
And youâve got the remote control
Strong as a flower youâve got the power
Twisting around my soul

[Chorus:]
Icebreaker take me higher
Just hold your warm body next to mine
Keep setting me on fire
And donât tell me love is blind
Icebreaker keep me in motion
I read your life as a fairytale
The sea around me is frozen
Show me where I can sail
