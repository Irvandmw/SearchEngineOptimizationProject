Lyrics:


I'm way across the coast, awake in bed and I wonder
If I spoke, would you hear what I said?
So I take a breath and hope you can.

A feeling deep inside that no one sees
But for no one to understand
But you and me tonight
Tell me that you'll take this chance

Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh I'll try my best for you
Oh I'll try my best for you

Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh I'll try my best
Oh I'll try my best
Oh I'll try my best for you

Hold your heart to keep you close
Where ever you are just spin the globe
But we can have the time of our lives right here at home
Just breath
And follow me on down this road

Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh I'll try my best for you
Oh I'll try my best for you

Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh I'll try my best
Oh I'll try my best
Oh I'll try my best for you

Oh I'll try my best for you
