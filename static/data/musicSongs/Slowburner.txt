Lyrics:


Keep on a slow burner
From Monday till Friday
Keep on a slow burner
Ank I'll take its place

Stay lonely, for four midnights
Till I'm holding you tight
Keep on a slow burner
And I'll take its place

Keep on a slow burner
From Monday till Friday
Keep on a slow burner
I'll take its place

Work hard now 
But not too much
Don't damage your soft touch
Keep on a slow burner
And I'll take its place
Keep on a slow burner etc...
