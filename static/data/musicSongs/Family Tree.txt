Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I'm gonna be the owner of the world for a little while
and it feels like I am flying
Everybody's waving in the crowd to get a smile
but they never saw me crying

Even when we dance across the floor
and everyone is calling out for more
Somewhere in your heart you feel alone

[Chorus:]
Hold my hand tonight
and show me what is right
Make my life complete
below the family tree

Take away my fear
and tell me you'll be there
We will always stay together
I will always know you care

Everybody's talking right behind my back
and I don't care what people are thinking - no
But in a little corner of my mind it's getting tough
when the moving lights are twinkling

[Chorus:]
Hold my hand tonight
and show me what is right
Make my life complete
below the family tree

When the heavy curtain falls
I know where I belong
I could never walk away from you
When the everyday life calls
I'm gonna sing our song
