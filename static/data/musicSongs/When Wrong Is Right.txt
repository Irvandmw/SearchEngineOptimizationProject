Lyrics:


You are hiding in the shadow
Escaping that forbidden smile
This is trouble and you do know
You have gone a little crazy now

By playing your own careless part
You're breaking someone's heart
Love is the maker of a million fools
Ready to bend all the rules

When wrong is right
When dark is light
And your mind is a riddle
When good is bad
It will make you sad
If you stay in the middle

You are up to stormy weather
After holding back for many years

Keep fighting when the freedom calls
With your back against the wall
Keep holding on to gratitude my friend
There's everything to lose

When wrong is right
When dark is light
And your mind is a riddle
When good is bad
It will make you sad
If you stay in the middle

When wrong is right
When dark is light
When good is bad, yeah
It will make you sad

Hold on to gratitude
Oh oh, oh oh oh
There's anything to lose
Oh oh, oh oh oh, yeah
When you're lost in the middle
