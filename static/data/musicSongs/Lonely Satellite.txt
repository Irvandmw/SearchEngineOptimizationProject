Lyrics:


How can you think it's right
to treat me like you do
You're so careless with the truth

How can we make it back
if you can't make amends
With no time left to pretend

Inside there's a river rising
Inside there's a lover denied
Inside there's a feeling that I can't fight

[Chorus:]
Lead me right back to the start
and leave me with a broken heart
My eyes are closed but all I see is you, it's you
Lead me back into the night
another lonely satellite
I don't know why I always fight with you, with you

I can barely see
the man I used to be
Now suspicion's covered me

Outside there's another horizon
Outside there's a flickering light
So far away but I must try

[Chorus:]
Lead me right back to the start
and leave me with a broken heart
My eyes are closed but all I see is you, it's you
Lead me back into the night
another lonely satellite
I don't know why I always fight with you, with you
