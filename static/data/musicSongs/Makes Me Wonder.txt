Lyrics:


Stepped off the air plane, I saw your face
It's been forever, but it don't feel that way
Your hand took my hand like it knew what to do
Girl it's so easy to be with you

[Chorus]
Makes me wonder [x3]
Why we're not in love

Cought up on the coffee, then walk around town
Some sidewalk singer was laying it down
You started dancin right there on the curb,
Thought to myself man there's somethin bout her

[Chorus]
Makes me wonder [x3]
Why we're not in love

Well I been thinkin bout her
Still can't tell ya why
All I know is that it's, hard to say goodbye

I got on that air plane, you got in your car
Looked out on that city wondering where you are
And if your feeling like me just a little bit sad
I already miss you, now what's up with that

[Chorus]
Make me wonder [x3]
Why we're not in love

Makes me wonder [x5]
Why we'er not in love
