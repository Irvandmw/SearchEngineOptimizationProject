[A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie:]
Ooh, yeah, yeah
You know how we pulling up
It's just [?]
Yeah
[?] on the beat

You know how we pulling up
We might not be big you can't find no bullets so don't try to bully us
Fuck around and catch a headshot, red dot
Hit 'em up
And even with my eyes closed now, I see how they don't fuck with us
But, fuck it, you know me, you know I'm goin' to run it up
Plus I'm goin' double R, R, R
I used to be regular, now up a young nigga stackin' my Benjie's up, up, up
They call me a singer but I'm rapping with melodies like, na, na, na, na, na
I'm a bread winner, yeah, nigga, so I'm stacking my cheddar up, up, up
You know how we pulling up, yeah, nigga, you know how we

Give it up
I swear nigga, you a dead, dead nigga, you tried to set me up
Niggas be scared and they go to the feds and they start singing, na, na, na
Be careful with these rat niggas out here actin' like they with you, na, na, na
It's only my niggas, we get high nigga, smokin' l-l-l-l-loud
Fly niggas and we always gon keep it a 100 like 95 plus 5
I know many men wishin' death up on me, niggas is tryna take my life
So I keep a friend with a F&N, that nigga always by my side

You know how we pulling up, yeah nigga, you know how we pulling up
We might not be big you can't find no bullets so don't try to bully us
Fuck around and catch a headshot, red dot
Hit 'em up
And even with my eyes closed now, I see how they don't fuck with us
But, fuck it, you know me, you know I'm goin' to run it up
Plus I'm goin' double R, R, R
I used to be regular, now up a young nigga stackin' my Benjie's up, up, up
They call me a singer but I'm rapping with melodies like, na, na, na, na, na
I'm a bread winner, yeah, nigga, so I'm stacking my cheddar up, up, up
You know how we pulling up, yeah, nigga, you know how we

[Trap Manny (A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie):]
Huh, yeah, you know how we pulling up
Back to back in foreigns, when I start the engine, I push a button
Still reminiscing them days people said I wouldn't be good, now
Had my head down, hope in the Wraith and I see stars when I'm lookin' up
And I dare a nigga try to bully us (Bully us)
Got a choppa with big bullets if they think they [?]
I'm with Boogie wit my hoodie up (Hoodie up)
I go 7:30 with this .30 off Perky's, I'm booted up
Run up, I'm shootin' somethin'
Glock nineteen, with a beam, make a move and I prove a point
Hop out that Urus truck
Know we coming with the nineteen whenever we hit the club, yeah
