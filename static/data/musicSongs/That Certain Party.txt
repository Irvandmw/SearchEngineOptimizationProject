Lyrics:


[DM] Has she got naughty eyes
[DM] Yes she has got naughty eyes
[DM] That certain that certain party
[DM] You know the one I mean
[DM] That certain party of mine

[DM] Naughty eyes turned up nose
[DM] Rosy cheeks and pretty clothes
[DM] Not a smarty

[DM] Has she got loving ways
[DM] Sure she has got loving ways
[DM] That certain party of mine

[JL] Hey Dean, remember the old time Vaudeville around 1924?
[DM] Why sure I do
[JL] With those corny jokes like "Can you stand on your head?"
[DM] Nah, it's too high
[JL] Nothing, we better sing

[B] Has she got you know what
[B] Yes she has got you know what
[B] That certain that certain party of mine
[B] Has she got I forgot
[B] Yes she has got I forgot
[B] That certain party of mine
[JL] You know what I forgot
[DM] This and that and quite a lot
[JL] Not a smarty
[B] Has she got everything
[B] Yes she has got everything
[B] That certain party of mine

[JL] (babble by Jerry)
[DM] Hold on, hold on, what are you doing?
[DM] Singing in shorthand?
[DM] You're speeding
[DM] That's better

[JL] (babble about wiener schnitzel)
[DM] That certain that certain party of mine
[JL] (babble about hasenpfeffer)
[DM] That certain party of mine

[DM] You know what I forgot
[DM] This and that and quite a lot
[DM] What a smarty
[JL] Has she got everything
[DM] Yes she has got everything
[DM] That certain party
[JL] That certain party
[B] That certain party of mine
