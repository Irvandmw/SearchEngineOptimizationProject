Lyrics:


I lost my tug of war today
Took my foot off of the brakes
The definition of insanity is looping on repeat
And expecting things to change
But what comes up must hit the ground
So I drink these anvils down
She always comes to me highly disguised, an angel whispering
So many pretty shapes

It's a dance with the devil
A stumbling tango
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
It's a dance
It's a dance
It's a dance

Just want to connect
But you won't let me do it
So I get altered
Twisted and conflicted, so I casually can shoot the shit
Wish less was going on
Wish I could just throw the ball
And ignore it all
Constantly distracted by the noise of my ping pong

It's a dance with the devil
A mercurial wrestle
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
It's a dance
It's a dance
It's a...

But what, what is it worth waking up with a crown of clouds?
What is it worth, when my head spins out with doubt?
Wish I could measure when the poison is pouring out
Oh

It's a dance
Oh no, oh no, I don't need you (it's a dance)
Oh no, oh no, I don't need you (it's a dance)
Oh no, oh no, I don't need you (it's a dance)
Oh no, oh no (it's a...)
