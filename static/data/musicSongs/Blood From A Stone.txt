Lyrics:


Baby, baby, I shoulda known
You can't get blood from a stone
And I can't get a love that's true
From you

Baby, baby, it's no joke
You can't get fire from smoke
And I can't get a love that's true
From you

Now you look so good, fine on the outside
You put me in a spin
You set me on fire, my hearts desire
What an awful fix I'm in

Baby, baby, I shoulda known
You can't get blood from a stone
And I can't get a love that's true
From you, oh yeah

Baby, baby, I shoulda known
You can't get blood from a stone
And I can't get a love that's true
From you, oh yeah
From you, oh yeah
From you
