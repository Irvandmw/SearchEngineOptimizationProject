Lyrics:


There ain't nothing that can't be done by me and God
Ain't nobody gonna come between me and God
One day we'll live together where the angels trod
Me and God

Early in the morning talking it over
Me and God
Late at night talking it over
Me and God
You could say we're like two peas in a pod
Me and God

He's my Father, He's my friend
The beginning and the end
He rules the world with the staff and the rod
We're a team
Me and God

I am weak, and Thou art strong
Me and God
He forgives me when I'm wrong
Me and God
He's the one I lean on when life gets hard
Me and God

He's my Father, He's my friend
The beginning and the end
He rules the world with the staff and the rod
We're a team
Me and God

He rules the world with the staff and the rod
We're a team
Me and God
We're a team
Me and God
