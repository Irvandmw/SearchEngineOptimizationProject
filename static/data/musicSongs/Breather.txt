Lyrics:


When the question never set before me
Can I feel it out once more
You are my full ambition
I walked on water
I'm sick of talking now

I want You by my side
So close that I can feel You breathing
I won't turn my head, be misguided
I need a breather

You take my breath away
You take my breath away [2x]

Stay here just enough to catch me when I'm falling

You fill me up just like a big balloon of helium
Can't get enough I want some more come on and fill me up
When I'm with You there ain't no other place I'd rather be
I just open up and receive Him
and He set me free

[repeat entire song]
