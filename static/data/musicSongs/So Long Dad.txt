Lyrics:


Home again and the streets are not much cleaner
And the quaint old south side scenery
Is quaint no more, just older than before
Go up the stairs and down the hallway
To my daddy's door

Your son is home dad and he's found a girl
And she's the greatest thing in all the world
I think you'll like her dad, I hope you do
But if you don't that's alright too

What's new dad, do you still work at the drugstore
That true, still polishin' the same floor
I miss my good old dad
My but it's great to be back
Home again, but we won't be living here dad
The smoke makes Jane's eyes tear so bad
And we can't have that, I'll write you where we're at
Janey's uncle owns a bank, I think I'll try my hand at that

So come and see us papa when you can
There'll always be a place for my old man
Just drop by when it's convinient to
Be sure to call before you do

So long dad, la la la la la la la la
So long dad, la la la la la la la la
So long dad, la la la la la la la la
So long dad, la la la la la la la la
So long dad, la la la la la la la la
So long dad, la la la la la la la la
