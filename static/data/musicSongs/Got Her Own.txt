Lyrics:


Me and all my girls
Keep it lit when we come through
We can buy a table
In the bar if we want to
Don't be tryna front
'Cause this ain't what you used to

Ladies in the building, probably making more than you do
He might got money, but I bet she got her own
You know she independent, when she leave here all alone

You already know, you know, you know, you know, you know
You already know, you know, you know, you know, you know
But you could still get it though
You could still get it, you could still get it (Uh-huh)
Only if you wit' it though, only if you wit' it
You still get it (Uh-huh)
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know (She got her own)

You be throwing money
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we could do that too
But we rather spend it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, on all them new shoes
Baby, I don't mind putting you on some new-new

Ladies in the building, probably making more than you do
He might got money, but I bet she got her own
You know she independent, when she leave here all alone

You already know, you know, you know, you know, you know
You already know, you know, you know, you know, you know
But you could still get it though
You could still get it, you could still get it (Uh-huh)
Only if you wit' it though, only if you wit' it
You could still get it (Uh-huh)
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know (She got her own)

He might got money but I bet she got her own, yeah
He might got (He might got), he might got (He might got)
He might got money but I bet she got her own (Yeah)
