Don't let him fool ya
I know he got a big ol' Cadillac, uh-oh
Don't let him fool ya
Pretty soon he'll have 2 take it back, ooh
Don't let him fool ya
I know he got some pretty fancy clothes, ooh ooh
Don't let him fool ya
Only heaven knows how much he owes, uh-oh

Don't let him fool ya
Don't let him fool ya (Oh no)
Don't let him fool ya (Oh)
Don't let him fool ya (No, oh yeah)
Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey hey
Everybody sing
Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey hey

Don't let him fool ya
I went to pay a bill at city hall, uh-oh
Don't let him fool ya
And I saw his picture hanging on the wall
Don't let him fool ya
I know he said his love will always last, ooh yeah
Don't let him fool ya
But the FBI is lookin' for his ass, oh yeah, oh

Don't let him fool ya
Don't let him fool ya (No no no)
Don't let him fool ya (Oh yeah)
Don't let him fool ya (Oh oh)
Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
Help me sing (Uh-oh)
Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
Break it on down

Don't let him fool ya (Ridin', oh yeah)
Don't let him fool ya (Oh yeah)
Don't let him fool ya (Oh)
