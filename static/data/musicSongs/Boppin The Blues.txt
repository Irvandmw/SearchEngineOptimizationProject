Lyrics:


Well all my friends are boppin' the blues
It must be goin' round
All my friends are boppin' the blues
And it must be goin' round
I love you baby but I must be rhythm bound

Well the doctor told me boy you don't need no pills
Yeah that doctor told me son you don't need no pills
Just a handful of nickels and a jukebox will cure your ills

Well all my friends are boppin' the blues
And it must be goin' round
All them cats are boppin' the blues
And it must be goin' round
I love you baby but I must be rhythm bound
Well the cat bug bit me man I don't feel no pain
Yeah that jitter bug caught me man I don't feel no pain
I still love you baby
But I'll never be the same

Well all them cats are boppin' the blues
It must be goin' round
All my friends are boppin' the blues
And it must be goin' round
I love you baby but I must be rhythm bound

Rock bop rhythm 'n blues
Rock bop rhythm 'n blues
Rhythm 'n blues it must be goin' round
