Lyrics:


I'm the sun, I'm the falling rain 
I'm the kind of man you can't explain

True love is one thing I've been dreaming of 
I give my love to you and when I do 
You are to me, the very deepest part of me

I am the world 
I am the sky 
I am the sea 
I'm anything that you want me to be

When you hurt me, then I become the night time 
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good for 
Me to see the way I should

I am the world 
I am the sky 
I am the sea 
I'm anything that you want me to be

I'm the sun, I'm the falling rain 
I'm the kind of man that you cant explain

I am the world 
I am the world.
