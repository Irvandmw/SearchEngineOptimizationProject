Lyrics:


Wet, wet, wet, wet
You know it's Pluto

Tiffany's, Tiffany's, we goin' shoppin' at Tiffany's
You crampin' me, they ampin' me
They bout to make me start braggin'
Five percent on the wagon
I spit and I'm hot as a dragon
My niggas in the streets be shootin'
My niggas in jail be stabbin'
I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Js at the door, got dem Js at the door
Got some Js at the door, got dem junkies at the door

Servin' up burgers boss, watchin' cameras
Drivin' foreign cars, totin' hammers
Gotta crazy squad in Alabama
South Carolina boys, we good in Tampa
Swipe the big credit card, it's worth the gamble
Lamborghini boys, excuse my manners
My paint wet, my neck wet
My ears wet, my wrist wet
Rings wet, my bitch wet
Her bitch wet, they stay wet
Anytime I miss her, I'ma call her, she stay wet
Emilio Pucci, Pucci is different from Gucci
Coupee, coupee, a cartoon you lookin' all droopy
Goofy, Goofy, these niggas they lookin' like groupies
Styro-foam cup, purple Act gluey

I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Js at the door, got dem Js at the door
Tiffany's, Tiffany's, we goin' shoppin' at Tiffany's
You crampin' me, they ampin' me
They bout to make me start braggin'
Five percent on the wagon
I spit and I'm hot as a dragon
My niggas in the streets be shootin'
My niggas in jail be stabbin'
I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Js at the door, got dem Js at the door

Purple Act gluey, sticky icky
Esco he a hippie, tricky, tricky
Pass your dog a mickey, hit me, lick me
Fuck me, just don't kiss me
Fuck me, just don't kiss me
I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Js at the door, got dem Js at the door
Got some Js at the door, got dam junkies at the door
Servin' up burgers boss, watchin' cameras

I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Js at the door, got dem Js at the door
Tiffany's, Tiffany's, we goin' shoppin' at Tiffany's
You crampin' me, they ampin' me
They bout to make me start braggin'
Five percent on the wagon
I spit and I'm hot as a dragon
My niggas in the streets be shootin'
My niggas in jail be stabbin'
I do good dope
