Lyrics:


Well Iâve been around
Since before the trains came through
Well Iâve seen a lot
But the first time my heart broke in two,
Was when they brought those Johnson brothers back,
To their momma with a flag

Well Iâm a small town

Thereâs hundreds just like me
Yeah but Iâm the one
Well you happen to be
When you learned how to ride your first bike
Up and down my street
Well you grew up
And couldnât wait to just get out

Iâm a small town

Where everyone knows everyone
There ainât no secrets around here
Sonny there you love me
You hang me for everything I am
Either I hold your heart
Or I hold you down

Iâm a small town

Just a dot there on the map
If you blink you miss me
Yeah well go ahead and laugh
But Iâm where you kissed your first someone
Iâm where you hit your last home run
Iâm where you lay your grandpa in the ground

Yeah, Iâm a small town

Where everyone knows everyone
There ainât no secrets around here
Sonny you love me
You hang me for everything I am
Either I hold your heart
Or I hold you down

Iâm a small town

You left in a cloud of dust
Big city bound
But I never once gave up
And when you looked into that newborn angelâs eyes
And it occurred
There was only one place good enough for her

Where everyone knows everyone
There ainât no secrets around here
Sonny you love me
You hang me for everything I am
Either I hold your heart
Or I hold you down

Iâm a small town

Iâm a small town

Iâm a small town
Iâm a small town
Iâm a small town
Yeah Iâm a small town
