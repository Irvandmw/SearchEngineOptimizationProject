Lyrics:


I was looking for an answer, for a way to stop the pain
When You came to me with healing (healing)
I was looking for a fix, when You broke these chains
What a beautiful feeling (feeling)
I was looking for a way back home

When I found healing for my wounded heart
I found mercy in Your open arms
I found freedom when You set me free
I found myself when You found me
When You found me, when You found me

I was looking for solutions when my world went up in flames
But You walked me through the fire (fire, but You walked me through the fire)
I was holding on to anger, with my fists around the reins
But You were holding me tighter (tighter, You were holding me tighter)
I was looking for a way back home

When I found healing for my wounded heart
I found mercy in Your open arms
I found freedom when You set me free
I found myself when You found meâ¦

When You found me, I was running and reckless
When You found me, now I'm running home
When You found me, I was running away
When You found me, now I'm running home
When You found me
Yeah, I finally found my redemption
You found me and You made me whole
Yeah, I didn't know that I've been missing
'Til You found me
When You found me

'Cause I found healing for my wounded heart
I found mercy in Your open arms
I found freedom when You set me free
I found myself when You found me
When You found me!

Farewell to all of my resentment
All my discontentment
Is forgiven and I let it go
Farewell to darkness and the silence
Anger from the violence
Is forgiven and I let it go

Farewell to all of my resentment
All my discontentment
Is forgiven and I let it go
Farewell to darkness and the silence
Anger from the violence
Is forgiven and I let it go

When You found me...
