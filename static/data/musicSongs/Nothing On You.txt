Lyrics:


I feel it
Can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I, I mean it
Don't you turn off the light
Oh, I don't wanna leave here ever, no

She was like, "Damn, boy, I never took you for a one-night stand"
So don't make plans for nothing but me and a little romance
Hey, you and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
Or keep them on, with nothing on, oh my my my

I was rollin' up something with you
Kickin' back in the way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringing my phone
But they ain't got nothin' on you
And you ain't got nothin' on you

Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol
Quiero comentarle que no sÃ© quÃ© pasÃ³
Desde que salimos por la tarde los dos
A besarnos los dos hasta hacer el amor

Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitaciÃ³n
Lo que hacÃ­amos los dos no se puede igualar
Parecemos ficciÃ³n cuando entramos en acciÃ³n
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeah

Pero lo que mata
Es que esta noche nos vemos y en mi casa
Y sÃ© lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

I was rollin' up something with you
Kickin' back in the way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringing my phone
But they ain't got nothin' on you
And you ain't got nothin' on you

Look, take the lead follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Homegirl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
A flight in a spaceship, I got a Land Rover
Casa Cruz, Casablanca, Casanova
I'ma fashionista she in FashionNova
And her mad persona when I had her over
That outfit it cost bread I got the matchin' loafers
Why? Cah that's somethin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothing on you, no

I was rollin' up something with you
Kickin' back in the way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringing my phone
But they ain't got nothin' on you
You ain't got nothin' on you

She was like, "Damn, boy, I never took you for a one-night stand"
She was like, "Damn, boy, I never took you for a one-night stand"
Want to be your man, boy I never took for a one night stand
She was like damn and you ain't got nothin' on you
