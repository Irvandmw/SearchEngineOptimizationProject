Lyrics:


Here we are, safe at last 
We can breath a sigh, seems the storm has passed 
Through it all, no one knew, 
That all the tears in heaven, would bring me back to you
No one I know, imagined we would make it
But it only matters that we both believe

[Chorus:]
You and me, we're a miracle; meant to be 
And nothing can change it 
Mountains move 
And oceans part 
When they are standing in our way 
You and me, we're a mircale; 
Angels stand watching over 
And heaven shines upon us, everyday 

Everytime, I felt near defeat
You were there for me oh
By my side completely
You give me strength ohh..
you set me free... hey yeah yeah
Its just because of you ohh..
I'm all that i can be ohh..
When im with you, the world is ours to reach for
Together there is nothing we can't do. ooh ooh..

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
The chance was so unlikely 
That we would ever win 
Two stars among the heavens 
Destiny brought you to me 

[Chorus]

You and me, We're a miracle (miracle)
You and me, We're a miracle (miracle)
Miracle
