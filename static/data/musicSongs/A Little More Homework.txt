Lyrics:


If you stand here behind me
And you call me a man
And you're counting on me to come through
You should know that I'll give you the best that I can
But we all have a little more homework to do

If you're walking beside me
And you wanna be friends
You should know I'm depending on you
So you gotta hang in there till the whole story ends
Cause we all have a little more homework to do

I've been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn't chime
But I'm not ready to put down my pencil just yet
There are too many answers that I didn't get
I need a little less pressure and a little more time

I'm trying to follow
I'm trying to lead
I'm trying to find what is true
But if you're gonna stand with me
Then you have to concede
That we all have a little more homework to do

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
You get a little bit older
A little bit taller
A little bit better
A little bit

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
And the days before all go too fast
You can't hold on
So, you go

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
I'm a little bit older
A little bit stronger
A little bit smarter
A little bit

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
And the days ahead coming on so quick
You can't get out of the way
You keep running

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
And I'm a little bit older
A little bit faster
A little bit closer
A little bit

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
And the sky goes blue
And the sky goes black
And no matter what you do
You can't go back

You go day into day, into day
Day into day, into day
Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day

And I've been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn't chime
And I'm not ready to put down my pencil just yet
There are too many answers that I didn't get
I need a little less pressure
And a little more time

I'm trying to follow, I am trying to lead
I am trying to learn what is true
I am trying to be what you want and I need, and we all have
A little more homework
We all have a little more homework
We all have, a little more homework to do

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day...
(A little more homework to do)
