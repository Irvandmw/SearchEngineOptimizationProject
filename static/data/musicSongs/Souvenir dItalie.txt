Song Name: Souvenir d'Italie
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The moonlight reflected the Mediterranean splendour
The silvery sand was a magical carpet of white
We shared with each other our kisses and willing surrender
And promised each other that we would remember that night

Then we had to part broken hearted
You gave me a shell as we parted ...
You told me to listen
For it had a message for me

Pretty shell that we found by the sea
Souvenir d'italie!

Pretty shell that I took home with me
Souvenir d'Italie!

Even though we are so far apart
Still the shell speaks to me
And a voice that is yours
Calls me back to your shores
Voice of love ...
Souvenir d'Italie!

Ma perchÃ© non mi fai piÃº dormire
Solo tu, me lo puoi dire
Te ne sei andata cosÃ­
E mi lasci partire
Souvenir, souvenir d'Italie!
