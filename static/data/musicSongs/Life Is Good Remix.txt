[Future:]
Say she want to eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
Anything she want she cashin' out without no problems
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't got love for your mama
You can die today, it ain't gon' save me none but drama (Super)

[Drake:]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up

[Future:]
Pluto
Help me fight my demons off know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a Cougar, she didn't wanna leave
Treat her like garbage, my heart was on my sleeve
Shoulda chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if She can get it out the creek
Why should I have trust for you ain't get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you you ain't kneeling to my feet
Why should I be carin' when I know I can't be beat?
See how the ice be glarin' when I come through and retrieve
It's easy to know it's us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes, I go Richard Millie
In another tax bracket, you niggas beneath me
Who causin' a racket in Jamaica on the weekend?
Cop a ticket on vacation, I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy 'cause my money long like Stevie
Take down with my son, right or wrong, FBG shit (Freebandz)
How you gon' be gang? You bang if you rich, what's in your bloodline?
Come in with some Talibans, everythin' gettin' gunned down
Halloween gang in this bitch, shit gettin' scary
Three hundred thousand for the cheapest ring
Cost a Bentley truck, I'm legendary, 'lil bitch
Hot off the thermometer, 'lil bitch
Hotter than fish grease, 'lil bitch
My ring cost a big VS blown as my wrist
I'm gettin' money like this, can't tell problems exist
I wake up fresh everyday like I'm goin' to take a pic
Hermes hit my main line, 'cause they know I'm lit
Stuffed a hundred fifty racks in your purse, 'lil bitch
And when I wake up, go surf in your pussy, hit
Say she wanna eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
This bitch not my bitch, I leveled up and went exotic
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't buyin' a Birkin for your mama
You can die today, I swear I still won't break my promise (Pluto)

Make love on a weekend as usual
Take drugs, goin' up, oh, that's usual
Every time she come, bitch
Every time I put my chains on, bitch

It's cool, man, got red bottoms on
Life is good, you know what I mean? Like-

Yeah, hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemar-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since

[DaBaby:]
I can't entertain all the flaws
I ain't been the same since they crossed me
You know how they do when you poppin'
You know Baby can't do all that talkin'
I got fools tryna sue up in Boston
I got dudes tryna sue down in Florida
I got hoes in L.A., got a new boo from Georgia
A milly, saved up to give to my daughter
Over one hundred K to Drew, fill in my lawyer (Let's go)
Six digits on cases, we beat it like Tina (Hmm)
Baby all on the T.V., that's easy
I mix mill with the gas and I bought me a beamer (Yeah)
Now I pull up in Ghosts, they ain't see me (Casper)
I know she gon' fuck, I ain't askin' (Uh huh)
F.N.N like a proper, she plastic (Phew)
Fuck around and get popped just for laughin' (Boom)
Put that boy in a box, pick a casket
I got take that ho to Dior, pick a shoe (Let's go)
Kickin' shit with your whore, that's my boo
You can go put hardwood on the floor with the hoop (Who?)
We like uppin' the score, we gon' shoot (Ball)
I never pick up when she call me (Brr, brr)
Help the bitch start a business, she bossin' (Uh-huh)
Like to wake up to sex like it's coffee (Sex)
Big baguettes on my neck, this shit cost me
Cartier, Audemar, Audemar or the Rolex (Let's go)
I've been broke before, bet I won't go back
When she walk through the door, take the iron, make her hold that (Hold that)
They ain't see me, go out like a ho, yeah (Ho)
You know these 'lil niggas got ho ways
Make them come air it out like the old days (Uh-huh)
You a throwaway, baby it's okay
My boy off a pill, need a OJ?
Yeah, bitch

[Lil Baby:]
Spent thirty racks on a rap bitch
Could've went and bought a brick, woah
Quarter million worth a chain
Ask IceBox, everybody lit, woah
It ain't no carbon deucin'
Nigga that's your man, everybody get it, woah
Made a few mill, made a few hits, fuckin' everybody bitch
Got somethin' to lose so I stay with a shooter
Got game from a GOAT, I know how to maneuver
She kinda cute, really somethin' to do
I got somethin' to do so I gave her to Pluto
Huh, hundred thousand for a body
Go inside a house and everybody get it, huh
Got a plug on exotic overnight, I'm floodin' everybody's city
Extra 350, might buy me a Richie, this shit get ridiculous
Syrup get sick,
Spot in Toronto, just show me the real ones
Give me a few months, I'll be servin' the six, woah
Rolls truck, four bus, all white gusts, call it good luck, woah
Neck lit, wrist lit, look, don't touch, rich, get bussed
Hop out a Phantom, they think it's Houdini
Sell fifty one day, I bought two Lamborghini
Hundred racks spent on a four carat diamond
I didn't propose but I bought her a ring
They had my bro, had to let that boy go
He had stick to the cold, he ain't tell them a thing, uh
Ballin' like we won a championship, yeah
Everybody get a ring, huh

[Future:]
Yeah, hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo

Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo

Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch
Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch (Yeah)
Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch (Woo)
Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch
