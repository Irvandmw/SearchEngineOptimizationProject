Lyrics:


She hit me like a blinding light and I was born
And gravity won't keep my feet down anymore
If you've seen her then you'd understand

An angel in my, the way she moves
She could make your heart beat faster than you knew
She's got a smile that can shake you, vibe that can break you
Eyes that can bring the heat
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(There's just one thing that I haven't told her)

Well, I've been holding back so much I'm in reverse
And buying her that drugstore diamond made it worse
Like the silver on her skin stood for something; a promise

I don't wanna burn out quick if she's the one
Like the fire in between a bullet and the gun
Because she's brighter than Vegas, hotter than Hades
Cool enough to make you freeze
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
I don't wanna lose her
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

Do you know what you do to me?
I've been captured, waiting for the rapture
Am I just a fool to believe this is it, this is it?

So tell me that you feel the same
Can we say what we wanna say?
'Cause there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
But I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)

She hit me like a blinding light and I was born
