Lyrics:


Love, your magic spell is everywhere
Love, I know you well and found you fair
Then you left me and my life's at fate
Now I ask is it too late

Love your melody is in the air
Yet I call you and you are not there
Come here is my heart, my soul to mate
Make me forget the voice that whispers "wait"

Love your melody is in the air
Yet I call you and you are not there
Come here is my heart, my soul to mate
Make me forget the voice that whispers "wait"
Make me forget the voice that whispers "wait"
