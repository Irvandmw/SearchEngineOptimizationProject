Lyrics:


Sleigh bells ring, are ya listenin'? 
In the lane snow is glistenin'  
a beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
walkin' in a winter wonderland!  

Gone away is the bluebird 
here to stay is a new bird  
he sings a love song as we go along  
walkin' in a winter wonderland!  

In the meadow we can build a snowman 
then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
he'll say "Are you married?"  
we'll say "No man!  
But you can do the job,  
when you're in town!"  

Later on, we'll conspire, 
as we dream, by the fire,  
to face unafraid,  
the plans that we've made  
walkin' in a winter wonderland!  

[instrumental break]

Sleigh bells ring, are ya listenin'? 
In the lane snow is glistenin'  
a beautiful sight, we're happy tonight... 
Oh!... walkin' in a winter wonderland!  

Gone away is the bluebird 
here to stay is a new bird ... 
he sings a love song as we go along  
walkin' in a winter wonderland!  

In the meadow we can build a snowman 
then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
he'll say "Are you married?"...  
we'll say "No man!  
But you can do the job,  
when you're in town!"  

Later on, we'll conspire, 
as we dream, by the fire,  
to face unafraid,  
the plans that we've made  
walkin' in a winter wonderland!  

We'll be happy in love 
as two turtle doves  
livin' in a fairy land!...  
Oh!... we'll be walkin'  
in a winter wonderland!
