Song Name: Ocean Of Love
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


No more crashing sounds only the wind
There's still fire in the ruins
I hear your shivering voice in my ear
Do you think it's over now
Do you think that there is nothing left to fear

Is the devil surviving somewhere inside you and me
I just can't believe it when I look into your eyes and I

[Chorus:]
I go swimming in your ocean of love
Forgetting everything in your ocean of love

The fighting is no more it's the end of the war
I think it must be over now
This time I think the madness finally left our world

Or is the devil still hidding somewhere inside you and me
I just can't believe it when I look into your eyes and I

[Chorus:]
I go swimming in your ocean of love
Forgetting everything in your ocean of love

I go swimming in your ocean of love
Forgetting everything in your ocean of love
I go dancing in your ocean of love
Remember nothing in your ocean of love

Innocent eyes they make me lie
Swimming around in an ocean of love
Innocent eyes they make me high
Floating around in an ocean of love
