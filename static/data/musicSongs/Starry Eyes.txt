Lyrics:


Starry eyes 
How can I get to you my true little
Starry eyes
What can I say or do for you my little
Starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine

Starry eyes 
What can I say to make you listen
Starry eyes
What can I do for your attention
Starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine

When I'm alone I hear & feel you
Wish that I could reach right out & touch you
But knowing you're the one to greet me & meet me
Two alone in the dark may it be

Starry eyes 
The sparks will fall on me
Starry eyes
Won't you listen that I'm here being
For you starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine
