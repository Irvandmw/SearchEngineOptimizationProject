Lyrics:


Yeah (ooh)
Who who? (Money money)
Rich friends

Who needs money when you got rich friends?
Who needs a bank account if the bank won't lend?
Who needs a daydream if everything is sin?

Who who?
Who needs money when you got rich friends?
Who? Ow! Who who?
Who needs money? Rich friends
Who? Ow! Who who? Get on
Rich friends

Who needs a job when you can open up a church?
You can't buy happiness but you can pay for the search
You forgotten the causeness of all your pain
Ain't nothin' worse than cryin' the blues in a private plane

Tell me who, ah who?
Who needs money when you got rich friends?
Who who? Ow! Who who?
Who needs money? Rich friends
Ooh
Who who? Ow! Who who?
Rich friends

Who needs cash when you can get a plastic card?
Oh, don't worry about tomorrow, y'all, I said it's much to hard
Oh, let's all charge the fisherman with the fat bottom line
Drop it in the water, hook a fish every time

People, who? Who who?
Who needs money when you got rich friends?
Who needs money when you got rich friends?
(Ooh) Who who? (Money money)
Rich friends

Spend another holiday playin' in Spain
Flip it on the eBay, the carpet stain
Just like the windows in the church that you bought in your name
Ooh, I guess another holy man, ooh, he died in vain
Yes he did, y'all

Who? Tell me who? (Oh)
Who needs money when you got rich friends? (Who needs money?)
Tell me... who needs money when you got rich friends? (Oh...)
Bank account? (Money money)
Keep dreamin'
Who needs money when you got rich friends?

Oh... (Rich friends)
(Who? Who who?) Oh yeah, alright
Rich friends
Tell me... who? (Who who?)
Who needs rich friends?
When you got money (Who? Who who?)
Oh, alright
Rich friends

Rich friends
Rich friends
Ooh
Money money
Ooh
Money money
Rich friends
