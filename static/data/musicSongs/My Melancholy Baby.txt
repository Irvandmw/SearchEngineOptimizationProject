Lyrics:


Come to me my melancholy baby, 
Cuddle up and don't be blue... 
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe 
You know dear that I'm in love with you! 

Every cloud must have a silver lining 
Wait until the sun shines through 
Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear 
Or else I shall be melancholy too! 

[instrumental break]

Every cloud must have a silver lining 
Wait until the sun shines through 
Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear 
Or else I shall be melancholy too!
