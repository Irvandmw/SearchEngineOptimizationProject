Lyrics:


When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eyes
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna perfect body
I wanna perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so very special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

She's running out again
She's running out
Run, run, run, run

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
I wish I was special
