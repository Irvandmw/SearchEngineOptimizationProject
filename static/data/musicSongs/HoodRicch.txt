Lyrics:


I came from the bottom lil nigga
All I ever dreamt about was being hoodricch
No flexin I don't model lil nigga
I just got a check and I ain't gotta show you
This Louis uffel getting heavy
Cause it's holding all my fetty
Got me feeling like ya ya ya
I know this shawty she gon let me in
In the BM's with a Chevy and you fucking with a ya ya ya

I just wanna pull up in that Ray Smith
Flooded diamonds, looking like spaceships
See I just wanna count that dough and take trips
Pussy nigga he be walking with that fake deep
My shooter got a dirty with the beam on it
She fucking so I had to put a team on it
And she just tryna poke we ain't tryna marry
Plus she knows I got the k she get a hundred carat
I told my pick homie we gon seek
Ill's way now I gotta be rogue no more aye yo
And when they freak Chillo I Know he a real nigga
Kiss all o my hoes on tour
Baby I'm not nothing like your last boy
Shrimp, lobster, make sure you got your fast boy
In the coup I do not have a back store
I get her and chillin nothing I gotta ask her

I came from the bottom lil nigga
All I ever dreamt about was being hoodricch
No flexin I don't model lil nigga
I just got a check and I ain't gotta show you
This Louis uffel getting heavy
Cause it's holding all my fetty
Got me feeling like ya ya ya
I know this shawty she gon let me in
In the BM's with a Chevy and you fucking with a ya ya ya

Ricch sex she always wanna have ricch sex
I bend her and beat it then I leave her lips wet
Shooter with me they always carry they big tank
Got a problem come out niggas ain't miss shit
See the whole game now I be screaming
We just tryna get the green but we not peeking
I been running to the bands till my feet hurt
Oh it might be on but listen to the teacher
She definitely make a profit make her teeth hurt
I'm not pimpin I'm just tryna get my feet firm
I been sma-sma-smashing on sexy bitches
If she bad I might put that bitch in reverse
I'm the sheet bitches you should be jumping on me
20 piece on me I feed these bitches they fucking hungry
High horse ride my dick like a fucking pony
Speak enough that I got this shit on my fucking lonely

I came from the bottom lil nigga
All I ever dreamt about was being hoodricch
No flexin I don't model lil nigga
I just got a check and I ain't gotta show shit
This Louis uffel getting heavy
Cause it's holding all my fetty
Got me feeling like ya ya ya
I know this shawty she gon let me in
In the BM's with a Chevy and you fucking with a ya ya ya
