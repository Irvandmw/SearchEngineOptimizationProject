Lyrics:


Do you know what I see
In those eyes looking back at me
Every safe road that ever brings me home
Every place I want to be
Every secret I'll never keep
Every last kiss every night before I go to sleep
Every thing I have Everything I'll ever want

I'm so in love
When I look in those eyes I can't look deep enough
Into you
The further I fall the further I want to be
I look at you I see the man I want to be
My whole life planned out in front of me
God only knows how far this dream is going
Cause that's just with my eyes open

Do you know what it's like
Lying here in your arms tonight
Your soft breath falling on my skin
We're almost surrendering
But wait for one more kiss
Baby your to beautiful

I'm so in love
When I look in those eyes I can't look deep enough
Into you
The further I fall the further I want to be
I look at you I see the man I want to be
My whole life planned out in front of me
God only knows how far this dream is going
Cause that's just with my eyes open

Ohhh you make me feel alive
I'm so in love
When I look in those eyes I can't look deep enough into you
I'm into you

I'm so in love
When I look in those eyes I can't look deep enough
Into you
The further I fall the further I want to be
I look at you I see the man I want to be
My whole life planned out in front of me
God only knows how far this dream is going
Cause that's just with my eyes open
