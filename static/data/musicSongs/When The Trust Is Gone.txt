Lyrics:


When the trust is gone
So is the love, so is the love
When the trust is gone, yeah
Nothing's enough, oh, nothing's enough

I really hate the way you look at me lately
It's like a stranger sitting right in my bed
You built an invisible wall that surrounds me
From every stupid little thing that I did

And I know that you want to be
Close to me baby

But when the trust is gone
So is the love, so is the love
When the trust is gone, yeah
Nothing's enough, oh, nothing's enough

And I know that you want to be
Close to me baby

When the trust is gone
So is the love, so is the love
When the trust is gone
Oh, nothing's enough, nothing's enough

I really hate the way you look at me lately
Oh no, when the trust is gone
I really hate the way you look at me lately
Oh no, when the trust is gone
When the trust is gone
