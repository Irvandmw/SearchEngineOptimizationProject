Lyrics:


Need some cure for this disease
Iâve been cursed with L.U.V.
With my visions bleed, my memories, of all the time we spent
Now Iâm left with only me, and my bodyâs feeling weak
I canât believe I didnât see, this moment come so fast

Youâve been swimming through my vein, vein, vein
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain 
I need that someone to replace, place, place
She needs to clear, clear, clear, my mental space

Now itâs over, baby girl itâs over
I need a cure, to wash my past, all away
Cause itâs over, my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past, all away

I let your soul inside of me, and your pain refused to leave
Itâs hard to breath when memories refuse to fade away
Wonât stop when you shut the door, all my life never think you'd go, there you go...

Youâve been swimming through my vein, vein, vein
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain
I need that someone to replace, place, place
She needs to clear, clear, clear, my mental space

Now itâs over, baby girl itâs over
I need a cure, to wash my past, all away
Cause itâs over, my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past, all away
