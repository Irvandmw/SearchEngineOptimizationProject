Lyrics:


I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ

I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ

I miss your body on my body
I miss the way we used to sway
(Miss the, miss the, miss theâ)
And it ain't hard to get me saucy, no
This beat gon' make me make a mess
(Miss the, miss the, miss theâ)

And I want you back
Baby, come dance on me
You're the only one who can handle me
And I want you back, yeah, yeah

I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ

I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ

I miss the way you talk to me
I miss the way you handle me
Boy, put your hands on me
'Cause I miss ya, miss ya, miss ya

And I want you back
Baby, come dance on me
See, you're the only one who can handle me
And I want you back, yeah, yeah

I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ

I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ

What you know about funk?
You say we're too young
It ain't that tough
You break it down, spread love
What you know about funk?
You say we're too young
It ain't that tough
You break it down, spread love

And I want you back
Baby, come dance on me
'Cause you're the only one who can handle me
And I want you back, yeah, yeah

I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ

I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the way we used to funk
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ

I miss the way we used to funk
(What you know about funk?)
I miss the way we used to funk
(You say we're too young)
I miss the way we used to funk
(It ain't that tough)
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ
(You break it down, spread love)

I miss the way we used to funk
(What you know about funk?)
I miss the way we used to funk
(You say we're too young)
I miss the way we used to funk
(It ain't that tough)
I miss the, miss the, miss theâ
(You break it down, spread love)
