Lyrics:


Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots, from blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather

C'mon now
Hooo

We'll be walkin' down the boardwalk
Watchin' them jaws drop
But ain't nobody lookin' at me
They're all too busy starin'
At what she ain't wearin'
Can you blame her? It's a hundred degrees

Yeah, all them girls are jealous
'Cause they know why the fellas
Are watchin' her put on a show
Hey, every time they see her
They all just wanna be her
Makin' country boys hearts explode

Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots, blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather

Oh, my my
C'mon now

She get it from her mama
Back in Tullahoma
Small town Tennessee
She wasn't made for drama
But like Nascar and Daytona
Yeah, that girl was made for me

Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots and blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather

Woooo

Play that thang

Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots, blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather

Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots and blue jeans and leather
Yeah, my girl was made for short skirt weather
Yellow polka dots, blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
