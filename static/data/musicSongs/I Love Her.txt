Lyrics:


Oh yeah

Baby, I know you gon' blame me for every problem (na na no, yeah)
Know everybody got some skeletons in their closet (oh yeah, huh)
Youâre always saying I don't love you right? (I know you would, huh)
And now you looking for somebody that's gon' do you better
I know you fuck with bitches, hope they get you wetter
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I hope you niggas get some bitches in Jamaica
Me no gonâ deal with fuck freaky, just paper
I know you better, when we all alone
Fuck a text message or a letter, bitch, we grown
Bein' sneaky and fuckin' with a lame nigga
Live your life, bet you, you wonât be the same nigga

They say haters be in they feelings
I've been a sucka for the love, gotta let it go
'Cause I see that you love different
My homies always tryna tell me nigga, let her go

But I love, I love her, I love her, I can't let it go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love, I love her, I can't let it go (oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Iâma do what I got to do, baby
But I love, I love, I love her, I can't let her go

When I lick the pussy, don't hear talkin'
I'm not gonna, I'm gon' haffi find a way out
You want that boxer right now, get me vexed, turn the lights down
Don't let these girls fuck your head up
I wanna lick it so you tell your bitches I did my thing
Even though you said you wouldn't say nothin'
Tryna get your bitches away from me
Pour up a eight up, I just light some

They say haters be in they feelings
I've been a sucka for the love, gotta let it go
'Cause I see that you love different
My homies always tryna tell me nigga, let her go

But I love, I love her, I love her, I can't let it go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love, I love her, I can't let it go (oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Iâma do what I got to do, baby
But I love, I love, I love her, I can't let her go
