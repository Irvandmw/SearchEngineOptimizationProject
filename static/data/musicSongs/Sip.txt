Lyrics:


'Cause I'm gonna take it off
So you might as well come naked

You look bad with them clothes on anyway
Never let a bright independent get up in the way
Pull up to the side, let you ride like the interstate
'Cause you said you could take it, take it off
It's midnight
Like we doin' a magic show
Yeah, we leave them scratches like animals
I'm off that poison, don't give me no antidote

My baby's coming over
We don't even need no foreplay
Even when we sober
We get drunk off love and have sex all day
Sip codeine, oh I
Let's take a sip

'Cause I'm gonna take it off
So you might as well come naked

Girl, I ain't playin', girl, I'm with this shit
Legs in the air, so I can put my face in it
Drop to your knees
So you can tell me, what you're dealin' with
'Cause you said you can take it, take it off

My baby's coming over
We don't even need no foreplay
Even when we sober
We get drunk off love then have sex all day
Sip codeine, oh I
Let's take a sip

My baby's coming over
We don't even need no foreplay
Even when we sober
We get drunk off love then have sex all day
Sip codeine, oh I
Let's take a sip
