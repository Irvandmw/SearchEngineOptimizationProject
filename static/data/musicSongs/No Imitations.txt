Lyrics:


We go out at night and the spotlight's on you
Every single eye stuck to you like glue
Dolled up to the nines yeah you outshine diamonds
Darling you do

And when the morning comes and the sunlight's creeping
And you wanna hide underneath your sheets
Even wide awake with your makeup streaking
You're still a dream

Now that I've found you
I won't accept no imitations
Now that I've found you
I won't accept no imitations

No I don't want nobody else
No I don't want nobody
No I don't want nobody else
No I don't want nobody else
No I don't want nobody
No I don't want nobody else

You're my irreplaceable, one and only
Nothing can compare to the love we make
I know that I never will be lonely
When I see your face

Now that I've found you
I won't accept no imitations
Now that I've found you
I won't accept no imitations

No I don't want nobody else
No I don't want nobody
No I don't want nobody else
No I don't want nobody else
No I don't want nobody
No I don't want nobody else

No contest I won't accept no imitations
Nothing less I won't accept no imitations

No I don't want nobody else
No I don't want nobody
No I don't want nobody else
No I don't want nobody else
No I don't want nobody
No I don't want nobody else

Now that I've found you
I won't accept no imitations
(I won't accept no imitations)
Now that I've found you
I won't accept no imitations
(I won't accept no imitations)
