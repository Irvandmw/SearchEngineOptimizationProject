Lyrics:


I'm the sole survivor
Standing here alone
No one here beside me
And whether I care of not
That's not the point
And whether I care of not
That's not the point

I'm the only witness
To have seen the truth
I could run until now
But whether I do or not
That's not the point
Whether I do or not
That's not the point

Sole survivor
Sole survivor
It bothers me
(It bothers me)
It bothers me
Sole survivor
Sole survivor

If I do or I don't
If I will or I won't
I just wanna make things appear
If I do or I don't
If I will or I won't
I just wanna make things appear

I'm the sole survivor
Standing here alone
No one here beside me
And whether I care of not
That's not the point
Whether I care of not
That's not the point
Whether I care of not
That's not the point

Sole survivor
Sole survivor
It bothers me
(It bothers me, it bothers me)
It bothers me
Sole survivor
Sole survivor
