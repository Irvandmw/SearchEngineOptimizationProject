Lyrics:


I was walking through the middle of the park
On Saturday morning at ten
Looking at the leaves and the bark
Laughing at the dogs and then
A man shoved a pamphlet in my face
All about the forgiveness of sins
I took if from him just in case
I should have thrown it in the bin
Thrown it in the bin
Thrown it in the bin

The pamphlet gave a Belfast address
There was a Scottish name signed on the line
It was the kind of stuff they made me ingest
In school when I was nine
It said "sin is a burden he can lift"
Sin is foul and must be cleansed away
Repent, or you'll be condemned
On the last day, on the last day, on the last day

Thank you so much for sharing
I know it's really caring
To break someone and rebuild them
To break someone and rebuild them

But I'm like the dirty ladies
And all the tiny babies
Who will burn in hell
If they don't come to God through him

Walking through the middle of the park
Saturday morning at ten
Looking at the leaves and the bark
Laughing at the dogs and then

Thank you so much for sharing
I know it's really caring
To break someone and rebuild them
Break em down and then rebuild them

But I'm like those dirty ladies
And all those tiny babies
Who you say will burn in hell
If they don't come to God through him

I was walking through the middle of the park
On Saturday morning at ten
I was looking at the leaves and the bark
Laughing at the dogs and then
It was a man shoved a pamphlet in my face
It was all about the forgiveness of sins
I took if from him just in case
I should have thrown it in the bin
Thrown it in the bin
Thrown it in the bin
