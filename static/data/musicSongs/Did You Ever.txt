Lyrics:


Did you ever?
Not so much, that you could notice
Could you estimate how many?
8 or 9
Will you do it anymore?
As soon as you walk out the door
Well I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time

Could I fix you once more?
No thanks I just had one
Then how about a nice big..
That would be just fine
Is there any special way
No, whatever you say
Well I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time

Does he look like
NO he taller and more handsome
Yeah but he is old 
Oh no he's young and he's in his prime
Does your father know? I'll bet,
Uh huh.. I haven't told him yet
Well I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time

But just for old times sake
That will be much harder
Then how about 
Well are you sure you don't mind
Hey, I know just thing for us
No, I'm afraid I'll miss my bus
Well, I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time
