Lyrics:


Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah
They got so much things to say right now
They got so much things to say
They got so much things to say right now
They got so much things to say

Eh! But I'll never forget no way: they crucified Jesus Christ
I'll never forget no way: they sold Marcus Garvey for rice
Oo-ooh
I'll never forget no way: they turned their back on Paul Bogle
Hey-ey
So don't you forget (no way) no youth
Who you are and where you stand in the struggle

They go so very, so very, so very, so very, so very, so very
So very, so very, so very, so very, so very
Everything they say - so much to say
They got so much things to say, so much things to say

I'n'I nah come to fight flesh and blood
But spiritual wickedness in 'igh and low places
So while they fight you down
Stand firm and give Jah thanks and praises
'Cos I'n'I no expect to be justified
By the laws of men - by the laws of men
Oh, true they have found me guilty
But through - through Jah proved my innocency

Oh, when the rain fall, fall, fall now
It don't fall on one man's housetop. Remember that
When the rain fall
It don't fall on one man's housetop

They singin': so very much, so very much, oh so very much
So very, very
They got so much things to say right now
Yeah, they got so much things to say

Hey, but I'n'I - I'n'I nah come to fight flesh and blood
But spiritual wickedness in 'igh and low places
So while, so while, so while they fight you down
Stand firm and give Jah thanks and praises
I'n'I no expect to be justified
By the laws of men - by the laws of men
Oh, hey through Jah to prove my innocency
I told you wicked think they found me guilty

They got la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
- they "la" very much all the time

So much things to say, rumour about
They got so much without humour
They don't know what they're doin', yeah
