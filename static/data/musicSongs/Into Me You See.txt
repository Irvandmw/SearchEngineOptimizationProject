Lyrics:


I built a wall so high no one could reach
A life of locks, I swallowed all the keys
I was petrified, only knew how to hide
They can't hurt me, if they don't know me
A full faÃ§ade, made a mirage out of me

Then you came and started diggin' for a treasure underneath
And you found a better version of me I had never seen

Into me you see
Into me you see
You broke me wide open
Open sesame
Into me you'll see
Into me you'll see
You got me wide open
Now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

I was a ship floating aimlessly
So camouflaged, was my own worst enemy

But then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
And every day I wake up grateful I'm no longer lost at sea

Into me you see
Into me you see
You broke me wide open
Open sesame
Into me you'll see
Into me you'll see
You got me wide open
Now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

Oh, cause no one's ever seen me like this
Seen right through the bullshit
I pray that I can keep unfolding
Pray that I can just stay open
Just stay open
Just stay open

Just stay open
Oh, cause you broke me wide open
Open sesame
Into me you'll see
Into me you'll see
You got me wide open
And now I'm ready
This is intimacy
