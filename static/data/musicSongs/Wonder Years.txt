Lyrics:


What, what if I said I'm tryna make it up
For all of the names that's playing games with you?
You deserve better love
Where, where are the places that they ain't take you?
Give me the book between your destinations
So I can book the flight and reservations

What would you do if I asked you to choose?
Would you keep pickin' on me?
Or am I the guy just for drunken nights
And while you're sober, you don't need me?
While you're sober, you don't need me
While you're sober, you don't know me

What if I ran into all my obligations?
And ran out your nerves and then make you go complacent
What if I fuck up your me-time? Listen to me now
Baby, it's me-time, me, me now
Oh, what would you do?
If I made you number two
Ain't that what you want me to do?

What would you do if I asked you to choose?
Would you keep pickin' on me?
Or am I the guy just for drunken nights
And while you're sober, you don't need me?
While you're sober, you don't know me

Why I keep doin' it to myself (Mmm)
Why I keep doin' it to myself (Oh)
Why I keep doin' it to myself (Oh)
You're why I keep doin' it to myself (Oh)
Why I keep doin' it to myself (Why)
Oh, why I keep doin' it to myself (Oh)
Oh, why I keep doin' it to myself (Oh)
Oh, why I keep doin' it to myself (Oh)
Why I keep doin' it to myself (Oh)
