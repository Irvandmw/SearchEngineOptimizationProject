Lyrics:


Don't let them talk don't let them tell you stories about the war
Don't let them in don't let them steal the gold in your heart
And if it's hard to do alone come on and take my hand
Don't be afraid together we'll fight
To keep the cruelty out of our lives

[Chorus:]
Let's build a room let's build a room
Where only lovers inside can breathe the air
Let's build a room let's build a room
Were the only thing is a bed on the floor
Let's build a room let's build a room
I'm sure the birds in the trees can tell exactly how
To build a room to build a room a room for love

The summers all over the land it isn't hard to understand
What we were doing if it wasn't for the war
Just take my hand together we'll fight
To keep the cruelty out of our lives

[Chorus:]
Let's build a room let's build a room
Where only lovers inside can breathe the air
Let's build a room let's build a room
Were the only thing is a bed on the floor
Let's build a room let's build a room
I'm sure the birds in the trees can tell exactly how
To build a room to build a room a room for love
