Lyrics:


I'm going to leave you some day,
But today is not the day.

You told me, if I didn't like.
The way, you lived your life.
I was free to go, and find somebody new.
So, walked out door again.
Turned around and walked back in.
There's nobody in the world for me, but you.

I'm gonna leave you some day.
But today is not the day.
When the day will be, I just can't say
I'll try again tomorrow, tried it yesterday.
I'm going to leave you someday, but today is not the day.

The suitcase has packed to go.
Everyother day or so.
But the frontdoor's the only place, it's ever been.
I bought the thing brand new.
But it's worned out for being used.
Carrying it to door and back again.

I'm gonna leave you some day.
But today is not the day.
When the day will be, I just can't say
I'll try again tomorrow, tried it yesterday.
I'm going to leave you someday, but today is not the day...
