Lyrics:


Love laughs at a king, kings don't mean a thing on the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new on the street of dreams

Gold, silver and gold
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam
Poor, there ain't nobody poor
Long as love is sure on the street of dreams

[instrumental]

All the gold, silver and gold
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam
Poor, nobody's poor
Long as love is sure on the street of dreams
