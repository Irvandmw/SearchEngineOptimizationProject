Lyrics:


Somebody loves you I want you to know
Longs to be near you where ever you go
Somebody loves you and right from the start
Happiness flew into someone's heart

Somebody loves you each hour of the day
When you're around dear or when you're away
Somebody loves you sweetheart can't you see
And that somebody is me

Somebody loves you each hour of the day
When you're around dear or when you're away
Somebody loves you sweetheart can't you see
And that somebody is me
Oh yeah
And that somebody is me
