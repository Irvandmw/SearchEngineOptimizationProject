Lyrics:


Your life is like a crack in the mirror
Seven years of bad luck it ain't getting better now
After  all is said and done
Reflection in the window is the same old face
Background small town everywhere you look around
Tell me what you're running from

Flip a coin and let it land in your hand
Heads you gonna stay but its tails so you can

Move to another town
Hide where you're sure you wont be found
But it's still just you on the inside
You can pretend it'll be alright
Sell it to yourself but you know it's just a lie
Cause it's still just you on the inside
Still you on the inside

Nothing faster than the speed of your leaving
Hundred miles an hour and there ain't no slowing down
But you cant outrun yourself
Yeah you can say you fit in like a joker in the deck but now
You're skipping like a broken record going round
And you're the last to ask for help

Flip a coin and let it land in your hand
Heads you gonna stay but its tails so you can

Move to another town
Hide where you're sure you wont be found
But it's still just you on the inside
You can't pretend it'll be alright
Sell it to yourself but you know it's just a lie
Cause it's still just you on the inside
Still you on the inside

It's never really been a question of how far
And at the end of every destination there you are

You can't move to another town
Hide where you're sure you won't be found
But it's still just you on the inside
Oh, you can pretend it will be alright
No matter how you sell it
When you tell it it's a lie
Cause it's still just you on the inside
Still you on the inside
You can go and change and to me you'll always be the same
Still you on the inside
You can try and run and know you'll always be the same inside
I still love you on the inside.
