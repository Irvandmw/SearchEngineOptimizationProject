Lyrics:


Dressed up for a big date
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now
A car crash with a suitcase
And a painted face
She was one of a kind

She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella
And roller skates in bed

He rides the greyhound
From his hometown
When he comes around
'Cause they don't let him drive now

Mixed-up as a milkshake
But make no mistake
Crash is lookin' like a star

You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
Dressed-up just like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars

Share a toothpick,
Trading lipstick
Watching traffic
For days at the diner

Holding hands,
Making big plans
Playing Superman,
He was wearing eyeliner

Another local legend
And his longtime lucky charm

You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
All dressed up like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars

They're drunk on love as you can get
Getting high on lust and cigarettes
Living life with no regrets
At least they're gonna try to fly

You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
We're Sid and Nancy
Fred and Ginger
Clyde and Bonnie
Liz and Richard
Kurt and Courtney
Bacall and Bogie
Joltin' Joe and Ms. Monroe
Here's captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars
And you and me is Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars
