Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Never been asked to dance
'Cause I've never been the pretty one
Never liked compliments
'Cause it's always been so hard believing them

You say I'm beautiful
And I say you're full of it
Nothing personal
I'm still not used to this

But I'm workin' on, workin' on it
Workin' on, workin' on it
I've been workin' on, workin' on it
Workin' on, workin' on

Gotta be good to me
I should give myself way more love
I'm my worst enemy
I'm the voice who says I'm not good enough

You say I'm beautiful
And I say you're full of it
Nothing personal
I'm still not used to this

But I'm workin' on, workin' on it
Workin' on, workin' on it
I've been workin' on, workin' on it
Workin' on, workin' on

Tryna see what you see when you look at me
I've been workin' on, workin' on it
Workin' on, workin' on it

Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
Too see what you see
Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
For you and for me

Trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
Too see what you see
Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
For you and for me, yeah

But I'm workin' on, workin' on it
Workin' on, workin' on it
I've been workin' on, workin' on it
Workin' on, workin' on

Tryna see what you see when you look at me
I've been workin' on, workin' on it
Workin' on, workin' on

But I'm workin' on, workin' on it
Workin' on, workin' on it
