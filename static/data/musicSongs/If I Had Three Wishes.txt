Song Name: If I Had Three Wishes
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Oh, if I had three wishes, my first would be for you
And if you became my love, I'd return the other two
Oh, if I had three wishes, I'd ask for you alone
All the other things I want will be mine when you're my own
But if you told me, that I must use the other two
It wouldn't matter, dear, cause here's what I would do
If I had those three wishes, my first would be for you
And the second and the third would be that my first wish comes true
