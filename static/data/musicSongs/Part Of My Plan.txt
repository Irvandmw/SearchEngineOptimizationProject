Lyrics:


Now and then I go weeks and then without seeing you honey
And it kills me when
I can't sleep in this half cold empty bed
Chasing down things I know now I'll always learn but could live without
I've been thinking hard about who I'm

You're the only part of my plan
You're the only part of my plan
You're the only thing I'll ever really understand
You're the only part of my plan

People talk, if I'm honest it crumble under the weight of all
But you pick me up, you build me up again
It took years to get us here, finally see a little clear
Now I know exactly who I'm

You're the only part of my plan
You're the only part of my plan
You're the only thing I'll ever really understand
You're the only part of my plan

So I'm gonna keep on running, keep on running home
Gonna keep on running, keep on running home
Gonna keep on running, keep on running home
Gonna keep on running, keep on running home
Gonna keep on running, keep on running home
Gonna keep on running, keep on running home
Gonna keep on running, keep on running home
Gonna keep on running, keep on running home
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh
