Lyrics:


I count my demons as they dance around my bed
I feel them breathing down my neck, it never ends
Tied up in bondage and I'm tired of giving in
I'm bleeding freedom through the stitches in my skin

Oh, steady
Aim, ready
Go, fire away

I lost control along the way
I got shot down by the ricochet
Sold my soul, no escape
(You're running from the ricochet)
I won't let go, I suffocate
Live to die another day
No control, I'm running from the ricochet

I'm somewhere in between the living and the dead
I've been so blinded I can't see where I've been lead
I feel so hopeless and I'm tired of giving in
I'll crucify myself to feel alive again

Oh, steady
Aim, ready
Go, fire away

I lost control along the way
I got shot down by the ricochet
Sold my soul, no escape
(You're running from the ricochet)
I won't let go, I suffocate
Live to die another day
No control, I'm running from the ricochet

I lost control along the way
I got shot down by the ricochet
Sold my soul, no escape
(You're running from the ricochet)
I won't let go, I suffocate
Live to die another day
No control, I'm running from the ricochet
Oh, I'm running from the ricochet
Run from the ricochet
