Lyrics:


Woah-oah, hm-hmm

You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up (call you up)
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one (be at one), oh

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention
What are you doing, huh huh?
Doin', what are you doing, huh huh?
You just want attention
What are you doing, huh huh?
Doin', what are you doing, huh huh?
You just want attention
You just want attention
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you (over you), oh

You just want attention
What are you doing, huh huh?
Doin', what are you doing, huh huh?
You just want attention
What are you doing, huh huh?
Doin', what are you doing, huh huh?
You just want attention
You just want attention
You just want attention
