Lyrics:


I was ridin' number nine
Headin' south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I got in trouble, had to roam
Left my gal and my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid acting smart
I went and broke my darlin's heart
I guess I was to young to know

They took me off the Georgia main
Locked me to a ball an' chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit an' cry
When that evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
'Til my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow

I'll never see that gal of mine
I'm in Georgia doin' time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
