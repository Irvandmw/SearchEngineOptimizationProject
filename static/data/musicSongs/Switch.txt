Lyrics:


Me and my niggas the realest
We don't fall out 'bout bitches
I fuck your hoe you fuck mine
I ain't trippin' we can switch 'em
I put my hoes up on game
Teach 'em how to keep it pimpin'
I told you don't talk out the turn
You fucked up when you didn't listen

Fuck it, I'm done with your ass
I keep the gun in my pants
I had my dick in her throat
I had my thumb in her ass
She told me she like when I smack her
She bust it open call me daddy
She smashed the covers of the mattress
Strapped it up I used the plastic
She beggin' to fuck without rubber
She fuck me and suck my little brother off
I ran through your clique like a hoe
I'm fuckin' like every last one of ya
My bitch know I'm a dog
Make that hoe give me a bone
Ask if she make a flick with me
Recorded that shit on my phone and

Me and my niggas the realest
We don't fall out 'bout bitches
I fuck your hoe you fuck mine
I ain't trippin' we can switch 'em
I put my hoes up on game
Teach 'em how to keep it pimpin'
I told you don't talk out the turn
You fucked up when you didn't listen

Now I got to put you on punishment
I told you 'bout pullin' that funny shit
You tried me, you know I don't play
So I'm 'bout to go get another bitch
Runnin' your mouth like you runnin' shit
You must've forgot who you runnin' with
MoneyBagg Yo and Yo Gotti
You do it to much off some other shit
I thought I told you it was over
You beefin' with the bitch 'bout me and I'm done with ya'll
I keep a stick for a hater
I pull it out and dump it on any one of ya'll
I dap you up but [?] greet you 'cause I don't fuck with none of ya'll
I went up the street with the bag
And I made a play and I came back with twenty ball and

Me and my niggas the realest
We don't fall out 'bout bitches
I fuck your hoe you fuck mine
I ain't trippin' we can switch 'em
I put my hoes up on game
Teach 'em how to keep it pimpin'
I told you don't talk out the turn
You fucked up when you didn't listen
