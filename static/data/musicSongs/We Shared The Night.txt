Lyrics:


Alone with you on naked feet
Creep into your soul
We reached the end of Lonely Street 
The end of feeling cold 

I have cried a thousand times
Iâve been searching all around me
This time and forever
I know that I have found (the love in me)

We shared the night 
We saw the light 
Deep in each others eyes 
The feeling that lifts us up 
That feeling we know is love

Home between your loving hands 
With your body next to mine 
I believe that we will be together trough the time 

I have gone for many walks 
Iâve been reeling home from town 
This time and forever I know that I have found (the love in me)

We shared the night 
We saw the light 
Deep in each others eyes 
The feeling that lifts us up
That feeling we know is love 

Walking through the door 
Into a life weâve been looking for 
Iâm a brand new soul 
In a brand new world
