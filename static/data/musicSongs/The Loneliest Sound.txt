Song Name: The Loneliest Sound
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The saddest sounds are the words goodbye
The softest sounds are the tears I cry
You walked away, and then I found
A heart that breaks is the loneliest sound

The cruelest sound that I have known
Is the silence when I'm left alone
You broke my heart and turned me down
And now I've heard the loneliest sound

The words that you found someone new
Keep pounding and pounding in my brain
And your footsteps as you walk, you walk away
Keep adding, adding to my pain

The happiest sound I'll never hear
Are just three words, oh I love you my dear
So I guess I'll hang around
Hearing just the loneliest sound

Drives me crazy
Can't stand it anymore
Aw it's getting to me
