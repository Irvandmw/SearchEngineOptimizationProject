Lyrics:


Playin' in a bar
We were tryin' to get up
They kept pullin' us down
Said we loved the sound
If you could just play somethin' we could dance to

Play us another one
Like the other ones
Like the ones on the radio
Don't go slow
Get on with the show

And I said
If you can't dance to this one
You can't dance till you take a chance
If you can't dance to this one
You can't dance

Listen to the song
You can move your feet
If you listen to your heartbeat
Close your eyes
Let your body go

Here comes another one
Like the other ones
Like the ones on the radio
Here we go
Get on with the show

And I said
If you can't dance to this one
You can't dance till you take a chance
If you can't dance to this one
You can't dance

Here comes another one
Like the other ones
Like the ones on the radio
Here we go
Get on with the show

And I said
If you can't dance to this one
You can't dance till you take a chance
If you can't dance to this one
You can't dance

And I said
If you can't dance to this one
You can't dance till you take a chance
If you can't dance to this one
You can't dance

If you can't dance
If you can't dance
If you can't dance
