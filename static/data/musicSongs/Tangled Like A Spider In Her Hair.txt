Lyrics:


She loves me like no one can
She has me right there
She makes me live like man
I'm tangled like a spider in her hair
I'm tangled like a spider in her hair

I touch her and then I
I touch her again and I'm
Tangled in the web that she weaves
I'll never be free from her mystery, I'm
Tangled inside the scent that she leaves

She wants me inside that hole
She has me right there
My world lives inside that bore
I'm tangled like a spider in her hair
I'm tangled in her hair
I'm tangled in her hair
