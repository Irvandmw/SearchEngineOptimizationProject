Lyrics:


I think its time we had that conversation again
I've been making you a habit since I don't wonder when

Summers almost here you don't have to say no more
But I still wonder what it is I met you for

In case you didn't notice you got me jumping in my skin
I am the shyest of the boldest whenever I let again

Summers almost here you don't have to say no more
But I still wonder what it is I met you for

Oh, summers almost here you don't have to say no more
But I still wonder what it is I met you for
