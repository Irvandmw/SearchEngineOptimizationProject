Song Name: Rough Love
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Pullin' teeth
Straight out of my mouth reeks
Of insecurities
You poured into me

If these walls talked
They'd tell you to stop
Stop with the murdering
Of my dignity

All the other boys wanted was to gaze in my eyes
All your sick little brain craved was to see me cry

Not this time [2x]

Look at me,
What have I become?
I'm just a toy
You played and destroyed

And what is love?
Does it push and shove?
And does it haunt you?
Make you feel like a fool?

All the other boys left me cause I wasn't good enough
Now I'm stuck with these nightmares of me accepting rough love

Not this time [2x]
Oh, oh, oh
Not this time [2x]

Every tear that falls from me
Is the last one you will see
Tell myself this all the time
I don't know what changes my mind

All the other boys wanted was to gaze in my eyes
All your sick little brain craved was to see me cry

All the other boys left me cause
I wasn't good enough
Now I'm stuck with these nightmares
Of me accepting rough love
