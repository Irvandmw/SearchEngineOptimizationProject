Lyrics:


For you I travel 'cross the world
20 hours in a plane just 'cause you my girl
Wanna see you smile; fuck the diamonds and the pearls
Promise me your pretty heart will never ever change
Promise me your pretty soul will always stay the same
Hope one day I can see your ass like all the time
Wake up in the morning; wish you right here by my side
See all of these boys holler at you all the time
You were lookin' at these boys like it's funny that they...

Try, yeah, yeah
I hope all of your dreams come true, yeah, yeah
I hope I get to see you improve, yeah, yeah
Even though for you, that's a tough thing to do
'Cause look at you, look at you, look at you

(Look at you, look at you, look at you
Look at you, look at you, look at you)
Look at you, look at you (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Look at you, look at you

Happy Birthday
