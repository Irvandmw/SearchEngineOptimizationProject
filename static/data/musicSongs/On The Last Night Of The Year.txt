Lyrics:


(On the last night of the year)

The crowd of strangers storm the Square
The countdown and the cheers
Theyâll freeze their a$$es off out there
But me Iâll stay right here
Theyâll lift a glass to all thatâs passed
And all thatâs supposed to be
Iâll toss the Christmas cards and burn
The dried up Christmas tree
On the last night of the year
On the last night of the year

Iâll make some resolutions now
Like shiny souvenirs
Theyâll wind up crumpled on the ground
With confetti and the beer
Beneath the quilt I pray my guilt
Will melt into the night
My weary eyes will search for signs
That I can make it right
On the last night of the year
On the last night of the year

Iâll stir the coals and fan the flame
At Christmas time each year
Theyâll lift a wish and dim the rain
Hope no one can hear
I'll shake my head and climb in bed
Before the ball comes down
That fine champagne right down the drain
Auld the quaint will just be drowned
On the last night of the year
On the last night of the year
