Lyrics:


The same nigga that took my bitch, I can't believe he did it
The same mouth they hating with they kiss his bitch with
And that's the same set of lips they sucked my dick with
Niggas crying on the internet having bitch fits
And I just sold six pounds at the QuikTrip
Every time I get some show money, I thank God, nigga
'Cause all I ever did was sell weed and rob niggas
And I ain't doing shit for free, I gotta charge niggas
Hope when those haters hatin', they don't got they broad with 'em
Yeah, I see you hatin', ignore, go fuck their bitch in my Jordans
Give my baby mama the phone and be like, "Baby, record it"
And you rappin' ass niggas, I'ma give you a warning
When you see me, it ain't no talkin', I'm just uppin' the .40
All you talking ass niggas gon' talk, nigga
'Cause I don't talk to lil' niggas, I'm a boss nigga
This lifestyle that I'm living, yeah, it cost, nigga
We robbin' all the rappers if I take a loss, nigga
These niggas pillow talking 'bout me, never did shit
I got a diaper on, nigga, and I'm still lit
What they gon' do about me, I'm too much to deal with
Who you know that could put a pamper on and talk some real shit?
And if a girl want it, I could give her some real dick
You 'round talkin' crazy 'bout a nigga and it still hit
Pulled it out, put it on her face, I nutted real quick
And every time she come around she act like she ain't did shit
