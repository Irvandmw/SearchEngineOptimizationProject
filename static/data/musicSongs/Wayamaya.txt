Lyrics:


He was a big wave surfer,
Living down by Wayamaya bay.
We had a few friends,
Never thought it would end.

I remember an all white day,
With eight story waves,
He said your eyes are grey,
(Careful).

We were living on Cody Lane,
Go carolling
Sun memories

Drivinâ in our Mercury down to Wayamaya,
Drivinâ in our Mercury.
Drivinâ in our Mercury down to Wayamaya,
Drivinâ in our Mercury.

I remember we came in May
And we changed our names
To Lana and Ray
We be up to the sun rosÃ©
Iâm in gold lamÃ©
Your pink floral haze

Drivinâ in a Mercury down to Wayamaya
Drivinâ in a Mercury
Drivinâ in a Mercury down to Wayamaya
Drivinâ in a Mercury

Waikiki cove, Waikiki cove
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki cove 
Waikiki cove, Waikiki cove
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki cove
