Lyrics:


I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus:]
Donât say "Yes", run away now
Iâll meet you when youâre out of the church at the back door
Donât wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me,
Donât you?

[Chorus:]
Donât say "Yes", run away now,
Iâll meet you when youâre out of the church at the back door.
Donât wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
Donât say "Yes", run away now,
Iâll meet you when youâre out of the church at the back door.
Donât wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, "Speak now."

Oh, la, la
Oh, oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
Thereâs the silence, thereâs my last chance.
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Iâm only looking at you.

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus:]
So, donât say "Yes", run away now,
Iâll meet you when youâre out of the church at the back door.
Donât wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
And you say, "Letâs run away now,
Iâll meet you when Iâm out of my tux at the back door.
Baby, I didnât say my vows,
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now."
