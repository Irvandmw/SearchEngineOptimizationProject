Lyrics:


It could be a black dress, high heels
Ripped up, torn up Lucky jeans
Or the covers in the morning
Her boyshorts and my favorite tee
Unbuttoned flannel layin' on the floor
Lingerie hangin' out the back of the door
I swear it don't matter what it is

She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you can't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does just right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in, she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Oh yeah

The way she wears my flatbill way better than me
Got me wanting everything underneath
Those blue eyes lookin' back at me
Looks like that can change everything
I swear

She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you don't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does just right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in, she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Yes she knows she can pull it off

Unbuttoned flannel layin' on the floor
Lingerie hangin' out the back of the door
I swear it don't matter what it is

She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you can't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does it right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in, she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Yeah she knows she can pull it off
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Yeah, she puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
