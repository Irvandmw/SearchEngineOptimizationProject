Lyrics:


Uh, yeah, oh, no...yeah!!!
Everything is gonna be alright
Uh, yeah, yeah!!!
Everything is gonna be alright
Yeah, yeah!!!
'Cause everything is gonna be alright
Aiaiaiaiaiaiaiaah
Everything is gonna be alright [x2]

Well I know just what you're thinking
I can see it in your eyes
Love can break us into pieces
Like it's done a million times, ohoh

But we know we got what it takes to make it
In the end everything is gonna be alright
Aiaiaiaia.aaah
Everything is gonna be alright [x2]

Watched the sun come up this morning
And it chased the way the rain
Had a dream that you were with me
Looking down from out space, ohoh

'Cause we know we got what it takes to make it
In the end everything is gonna be alright
Aiaiaiaia.aaah
Everything is gonna be alright [x3]
Aiaiaiaiaiaiaiaaah
'Cause everything is gonna be alright

Out in the streets, under the city lights
I feel the chaos taking over me
Life is moving at the speed the light
At look at you and everything is gonna be alright

Yeah
Everything is gonna be alright
Uhh yeah, yeahhh
Everything is gonna be alright
Aiaiaiaaah
Everything is gonna be alright [x3]

Out here we're the stars
Nobody can't fuck with us
Don't care how far
We're gonna make it [x4]
.....'cause everything is gonna be alright!!!
