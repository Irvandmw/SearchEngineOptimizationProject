Lyrics:


Takes two to tango two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango do the tango do the dance of love

You can sail on a ship by yourself
Take a nap or nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own
There are lots of things that you can do alone

But takes two to tango two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango do the tango do the dance of love

You can croon to the moon by yourself
Well you can laugh like a loon by yourself
Spend a lot go to pot on your own
There are a lot of things that you can do alone

But takes two to tango two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango do the tango do the dance of love
Takes two takes two
Darling it always takes two
To tango
