Lyrics:


Friday night and no one's home
There's no point getting drunk alone
Grab your coat and make a call
I'll meet you down in Temple Bar
People come and people go
So raise your glass to who you know
Winter haze, ain't taking hope
So why do I feel so cold

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me where did it all go wrong
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me where did it all go wrong

Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong
Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong

Saw a girl that I used to know
It's funny how a heart moves on
She's got a home and a family
I get a feeling she's forgotten me
People leave their mark and go
Like footprints in a winter snow
Winter haze, ain't taking hope
Why do I feel so cold

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me where did it all go wrong
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me where did it all go wrong

Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong
Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me where did it all go wrong
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me where did it all go wrong

Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong
Oh where did it all go wrong
Go wrong
