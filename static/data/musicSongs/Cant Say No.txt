Lyrics:


My lady be trippin' sometimes
I let her get away with it
'Cause she so God damn fine

My baby loves to argue
But I don't pay her no mind
I drop that wood on her
And get back on my grind

She know what she doing
She know what she want
She know how to move me
And she know when she wrong
That's why we break up
Break up, break up, only to
Make up, make up, make up
Why we fighting
We can do the night thing

I got somebody
That I wanna let go, wanna let go
But it's some 'bout that booty
That I can't let go, can't let go

Said I got somebody
That I wanna let go, wanna let go
But it's some 'bout that booty
That I can't say no, can't say no
Can't say no

Ohh no, can't say no, can't say no
Ohh no, can't say no, can't say no
Ohh no

I know why you never listen
Just want me to put you in that position
Make you say ohh no
And if you was ever missing
The thought of being with other niggas
I be like ohh no

If anything was to happen
You know I'll be the first to take action
For you
'Cause you still got a hold on me
Don't you

She know what she doing
She know what she want
She know how to move me
And she know when she wrong
That's why we break up
Break up, break up, only to
Make up, make up, make up
Why we fighting
We can do the night thing

I got somebody
That I wanna let go, wanna let go
But it's some 'bout that booty
That I can't let go, can't let go

Said I got somebody
That I wanna let go, wanna let go
But it's some 'bout that booty
That I can't say no, can't say no
Can't say no

Ohh no, can't say no, can't say no
Ohh no, can't say no, can't say no
Ohh no...
