Lyrics:


Ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure

Cupid was a blind man
He must have missed his mark
Shot an arrow in the air and hit me in the heart
I went to see Saint Valentine
Said "What's come over me"?
Daddy must have missed the chapter about the birds and bees
You can be the King of diamonds
You can cash in all your gold
You could hire Johnnie Cochran
It's too late to save your soul

Don't need no shot, no ambulance
Don't need prescription drugs
There ain't no cure for love
They can find the cure for the common cold
When the pushing comes to shove
There ain't no cure for love

Now someone call my lawyer
I'm going to see my shrink
I found myself in the jewelry store buying a diamond ring
I went to see my doctor
Said "Won't you help me please"?
He said "Son I'm sorry, it's a terminal disease"
Can't get no love insurance
Cupid draws his bow
I ain't waving boys, I'm drowning
It's a damn good way to go

Don't need no shot, no ambulance
Don't need prescription drugs
There ain't no cure for love
They can find the cure for the common cold
When the pushing comes to shove
There ain't no cure for love

You can be the King of Diamonds
You can cash in all your gold
You can hire Johnnie Cochran
It's too late to save your soul

Don't need no shot, no ambulance
Don't need prescription drugs
There ain't no cure for love
They can find the cure for the common cold
When the pushing comes to shove
There ain't no cure for love

No aspirin, no ambulance
Or Voodoo you can think up
Ain't no cure for love

Ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love

There ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
Ain't no cure for love
