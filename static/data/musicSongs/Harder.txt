Lyrics:


So, so different
Low, low whippin'
No, no, low pro trippin
Slowbro, loco, popo tippin
Big stack of money like I'm m Goku
Tippin' Romo in the Pro Bowl
Kick it like a nigga without no goal
Where the challenger is? Ah, no show
Uh oh, Urkel "did I do that?"
And before you spit a line I surmise you we're
Okay, don't take this to heart
You played a loser in this movie don't miss your part
So when I come back for that very first time
I spit it like my very first line

They call my name 'Los, I tell you what I'm 'bout
I came with the money, if there's ever any doubt
I walked in broke, I'm walking out fly
I'm yellin' out la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I get it in harder, my name 'Los
I get it in harder, I run around
I get it in harder, my name 'Los
I get it in harder, fuck is this about

Blue-jean clinging the choir stuff
Hanging tea on neon boots, with the tree on
L with the V on, that we can agree on
Guess it was just well-received, like Beyonce
Stayin' in this flight, take a try, who can land this
What gives you the righteous "Miranda's"
Oh, hello, goodbye, goodbye, uh
Don't say a word of that, say what you heard of that
Better reverberate, I kill tracks with care
Look at that murder-rate
Do this back-to-back, look at my vertebrae
That's just fact, in fact it should deter the hate
But I prefer the fame

They call my name 'Los, I tell you what I'm 'bout
I came with the money, if there's ever any doubt
I walked in broke, I'm walking out fly
I'm yellin' out la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I get it in harder, my name 'Los
I get it in harder, I run around
I get it in harder, my name 'Los
I get it in harder, fuck is this about

Hop-scotch, now scally top, tall
Would you say that I came a long way, fall
Big business, yes, thank God, bless
All that got a nigga gassep up, pest
Passed up breast and I passed up flesh
Then I breeze through the class and I ask what's next, yeah
I've always been a truth, so it's never been guess, nah
And all that I used to get here, was a test
It's couldn't be painless, [?] stainless
Scream SAINt JHN when the ask what the name is
Always in the same round, always in the same crest
They know I'm the second coming, so I been the main guesst

They call my name 'Los, I tell you what I'm 'bout
I came with the money, if there's ever any doubt
I walked in broke, I'm walking out fly
I'm yellin' out la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I get it in harder, my name 'Los
I get it in harder, I run around
I get it in harder, my name 'Los
I get it in harder, fuck is this about
