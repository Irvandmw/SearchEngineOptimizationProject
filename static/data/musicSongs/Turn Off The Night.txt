Song Name: Turn Off The Night

Lyrics:


I think about you every time
I take a breath and then
I let it go
I remember when you were mine
But you were just a dream
I used to hold

Now there's no sleep
Cause every star
Is lighting up
All of these memories haunting
Knowing there's so much of you I'm still wanting
Here with me
I pray for the dark
Cause if it comes
Maybe some how I'd be alright
If I could just turn off the night

I think about the way you used to say my name
And how it made me feel everything
Now I'm looking for anyway
To make it through until
The morning

But there's no sleep
Cause every star
Is lighting up
All of these memories haunting
Knowing there's so much of you I'm still wanting
Here with me
I pray for the dark
Cause if it comes
Maybe some how I'd be alright
If I could just turn off the night

If only I
Could just close my eyes
I'd finally be over you

But there's no sleep
Cause every star
Is lighting up
All of these memories haunting
Knowing there's so much of you I'm still wanting
Here with me
I pray for the dark
Cause if it comes
Maybe some how I'd be alright
If I could just turn off the night
