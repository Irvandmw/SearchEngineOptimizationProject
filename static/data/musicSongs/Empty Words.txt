Lyrics:


The funny thing about hurting people
Is they tend to hurt people
The funny thing about lies is
They're only lies
The funny thing about hearts is
They tend to break easy
The funny thing about healing is
I'm alright

Your voice was like a knife
It used to make me cry
You tried to cut my pride
Not this time

So go ahead and say the things you gotta say
You know you're only throwing empty words my way
Cause you won't break me, you won't break me
You can't take me down, no

The funny thing about listening is
I don't have to hear you and the
Funny thing about talking is
Your words are tired
Now I've come to realize that
Life can be cruel but
The only approval that I need is mine

Your voice was like a knife
It used to make me cry
You tried to cut my pride
Not this time (yeah)

So go ahead and say the things you gotta say
You know you're only throwing empty words my way
Cause you won't break me, you won't break me
You can't take me down, no

So go ahead and say the things you gotta say
It's only empty words a million miles away
Cause you won't break me, you won't break me
You can't take me down, no

The hardest part of this
Cannot be heard or seen
This journey starts when I begin loving me

So go ahead and say the things you gotta say
You know you're only throwing empty words my way
Cause you won't break me, you won't break me
You can't take me down, no

So go ahead and say the things you gotta say
It's only empty words a million miles away
Cause you won't break me, you won't break me
You can't take me down, no

So go ahead and say the things you gotta say
You know you're only throwing empty words my way
