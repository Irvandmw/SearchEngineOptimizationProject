Lyrics:


Falling in the deep end
Stop messin' around
I cant keep from falling
When your not around
I cant no rest when you leave
Your love keeps me burnin'
You got me lost and found
And my world keeps turnin'

It's not the same
When your gone
Feel like I'm
Half of myself
Cause i need to have you around

I need to hear that sound
Of you creepin in the mornin'
I need to look in your eyes
When it keeps me learnin'

It's not the same
When your gone
Feel like I'm
Half of myself
Cause I cant keep my feet on the ground
You keep my lost and found
And girl it feels good

So, I want you to know
Im ready to let it show
That I'll be around

It's not the same
When your gone
Feel like I'm
Half of myself
It's not the same
When your gone
Feel like I'm
Half of a man
But, I cant keep my feet on the ground
You got me lost and found
And, girl, it feels good

So, I want you to know
I'm ready to let it show
That I'll be around

Cant keep my feet on the ground
You got me lost and found
And girl it feels good

So, I want you to know
I'm ready to let it show
That I'll be around
