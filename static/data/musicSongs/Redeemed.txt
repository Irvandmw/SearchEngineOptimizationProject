Lyrics:


Night has passed away
But I've lived to see another day
And I'm glad that I'm around
Yesterday was bad, don't think I've ever felt so sad
But it left without a sound
The sun came rising up
And it drove away the darkness
The morning air is clean
I'm redeemed, I'm redeemed

Found the strength I lacked
To shake this burden from my back
Between the hours of four and five
And as I fell asleep
I heard the traffic in the street
And felt the joy of being alive
I don't trust myself
So I trust myself to reason
But I feel what it means
I'm redeemed, I'm redeemed

The sun came rising up
And it drove away the darkness
The morning air is clean
I'm redeemed, I'm redeemed
I don't trust myself
So I trust myself to reason
But I feel what it means
I'm redeemed, I'm redeemed
