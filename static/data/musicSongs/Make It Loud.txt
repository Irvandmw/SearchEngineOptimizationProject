Lyrics:


This is not your average rodeo (Ayy)
Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes (Ayy)
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud
Make it loud
A little louder
A little louder (Ooh-ooh)
(Ha! JB, leggo)
Ooh, make it loud

I be Mr. Who You Wanna Be
Don't hate me 'cause I'm doin' me, you won't wanna be
Anywhere I go, girl, you should follow me
And I don't mean Twitter, just come follow and me
Bottles of that Kool-Aid, drink some
Already know I'm your favorite flavor, but pick one
Already got them girls screaming, "Where he came from?"
Get it up while I'm feeling like an alien

Wake up in the morning and I'm looking for my clothes
Couldn't tell the time 'cause my wrist stay froze
Stayed at my girl crib, snuck out the back door
Speedin' to the show, I'm cuttin' it close
Your boy's still young but you know that I'm a pro
I'm thankful for my fans, so I'm rockin' every show
Show, I'm in Mexico
I got 'em going crazy, ooh-ooh, loco

This is not your average rodeo (Ayy)
Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes (Ayy)
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud
Make it loud
A little louder
A little louder (Ooh-ooh)
Ooh, make it loud

I'm doin' a hunnid, I'm tryna peel out
I'm wilin' out, I need to slow down
Down the reg', all I see is you, oh
Come here, girl, I won't hurt you
Just throw my heart, I wanna search you
Can I pat you down?
Girl, your body's sayin'

Wake up in the morning and I'm looking for my clothes (Yeah)
Couldn't tell the time 'cause my wrist stay froze (Oh)
Stayed at my girl crib, snuck out the back door (Door)
Speedin' to the show, I'm cuttin' it close (Oh-oh)
Your boy's still young but you know that I'm a pro (Yeah)
I'm thankful for my fans, so I'm rockin' every show (Yeah)
Show, I'm in Mexico (Oh)
I got 'em going crazy, ooh-ooh, loco

This is not your average rodeo (Ayy)
Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes (Ayy)
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud
Make it loud
A little louder
A little louder (Ooh-ooh)
(Ha! JB, leggo)
Ooh, make it loud

I got 'em goin' crazy, hand on my antenna
Goin' apeshit, someone throw me a bannana
Pose
Now watch me pose for the cameras
Click, click, click, watch 'em all go Adam Sandler
These girls go too loco, they won't let me on they campus
I guess they parents feel like I don't meet they standards
I felt too many co-ed parties, we in our pajamas
Vegas pool party, hunnid girls in my cabana
Hunnid on my neck, your house on my pinkie
All I see is green, dollar signs when I'm blinkin'
More bucks on the tour bus
Me and Bieber hit the Dougie, they cheer for us

This is not your average rodeo (Ayy)
Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes (Ayy)
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud
Make it loud
A little louder
A little louder (Ooh-ooh)
(Ha! JB, leggo)
Ooh, make it loud
