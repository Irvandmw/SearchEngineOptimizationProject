Lyrics:


[Aretha:]
Without you darling I'm no good
I'm just as hopeless, one sad look
Your place is here with me, here's your home
Don't leave me darling, don't do wrong

[Aretha:]
I was made for you boy, tell me now
[Van:]
And you were made for me girl, and how
[Aretha:]
I'm gonna love you forever, I'm by your side
[Van:]
And I'm your man for life

[Aretha & Van:]
There's no one for me only you
[Van:]
I'm glad to hold my love, that's for true
And think about me baby, I'm here to stay
Believe me when I say I won't go away

[Van:]
I was made for you girl, ain't that right?
[Aretha:]
And you were made for me boy, you know it's tight
[Van:]
And I'll be there when our love is felt, I'll show you well
[Aretha:]
Oh, I believe it, and it's well, it's well

[Aretha:]
I was made for you boy, ain't that right?
[Van:]
You were made for me girl, you know it's tight
[Aretha:]
And I'm gonna love you forever, I'm by your side
[Van:]
And I'm your man for life

[Aretha:]
Without you darling I'm no good
I'm just as hopeless, one sad look
Ooh, ooh, ooh, without you darling I'm no good
I'm just as hopeless, one sad look
Without you darling I'm no good
And I'm just as hopeless, one sad look
Ooh, ooh, ooh, hey, hey boy
[Van:]
Hey, hey girl
