Lyrics:


You with the suitcase and the tattoos
What's the story, love? Where you're running to?
With your pretty eyes and your black hair,
I apologies, cannot stare

(Tell me why?) I feel like I could love you before I say hello!
(I don't know why) I'd sold myself away for a girl I don't even know!

You, you belong, you belong inside the songs I sing,
You, you belong, you will always be the one I dream of
From this night on!

What's it gonna take? What can I do?
To spend every day and every night with you?
I'll be your white knight, save you and set you free
Make any sacrifice to get you next to me!

(Tell me why?) I feel like I could love you before I say hello!
(I don't know why) I'd sold myself away for a girl I don't even know!

You, you belong, you belong inside the songs I sing,
You, you belong, you will always be the one I dream of
From this night on!

Something tells me you can make me better
You can make me better
You can light my way through the dark
There's no fear when we're together
You can make me better
Yeah, you can make me better.

You, you belong, you belong inside the songs I sing,
You, you belong, you will always be the one I dream of
You, you belong, you belong inside the songs I sing,
You, you belong, you will always be the one I dream of
From this night on!
From this night on!
This night on...
