Lyrics:


Listen

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

Rolling high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what good
Kiss my momma, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talking lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick
Guess what they did, smack that trick
Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the capital B, I don't need no hype
The capital B mean I'm 'bout that life
The capital B mean, I'm 'bout that life, Bitch
