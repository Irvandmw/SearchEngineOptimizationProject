Lyrics:


Take me to the night I'm tippin'
Topsy-turvy, upside-down
Hold me tight and tell me what you sish for
There is no one here around
You may sing song my sweet smiles
Regardless of the cities careless frown
Come watch the no-colours fade
Blazing into petal sprays of violets of dawn

In blissful wonderments enchantment
You can lift my wings softly to flight
Whirling, twirling, puppy-warm
Before the flashing cloaks of darkness gone
Come see the no-colours fade
Blazing into petal sprays of violets of dawn

A prince charming I'll be, on two white steeds
To give you dappled diamond crowns
And climb your towers sleeping beauty
'Fore you ever know I've left the ground
You can wear a Cinderella, Snow-White
Alice Wonderland gown
Come watch the no-colours fade
Blazing into petal sprays of violets of dawn

But if I seem to wander off in dream-like looks
Please let me settle slowly
It's only me just staring out at you
A seeming stranger speaking holy
I don't mean to wake you up
It's only loneliness just coming on
So let the colours fade
Blazing into petal sprays of violets of dawn

Like shadows bursting into mist
Behind echoes of this nonsense song
It's just a chasing, whispering trail of secret steps
Oh see them laughing on
There's magic in the sleepiness
Of waking to a childish sounding yawn
Come watch the no-colours fade
Blazing into petal sprays of violets of dawn
