Lyrics:


She was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl,
A very clever girl who stood out amongst several once
A terrible dilemma and forever heâll regret this day he didnât make the
Rescue from the bull ring
Sulking wonât get you nowhere son,
Thereâs blood on your chin where youâve bitten your tongue
Smitten but might not be smitten for long if youâre still sitting sheâll soon
Be smitten and gone
