Lyrics:


If you do want me
Gimme a little sweet talk
If you don't want me
Don't lead me on girl
But if you need me
Show me that you love me

I need you, if you want me to
I'll be there all you got to do

Is just give me some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
Show me that your mine girl
Alright
Just give me some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
Show me that your mine girl
Alright

If you do want me
Gimme a little sweet talk
If you don't want me
Don't lead me on girl
But if you need me
Show me that you love me

I need you, if you want me to
I'll be there all you got to do

Is just give me some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
Show me that your mine girl
Alright
Just give me some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
Show me that your mine girl
Alright

Just give me some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
Show me that your mine girl
Alright
Just give me some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
Show me that your mine girl
Alright

Just give me some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
Show me that your mine girl
Alright
Just give me some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
Show me that your mine girl
Alright
