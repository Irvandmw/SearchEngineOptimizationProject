Lyrics:


Just to tell you that she's sorry
But she loves me more than you
Did you do all the good things I said
Don't worry 'cause you do

She made promises to you
Promises of good things to come
But they never do

Will you try to make believe
It's not as easy as it seems
You forget about all the promises
But you can't stop your dreams

She made promises to you
Promises of good things to come
But they never do

Does it mean that much to you
Go through the changes that you do
I could be satisfied
But she's never try

Does it mean that much to you
Go through the changes that you do
I could be satisfied
But she's never try

Would you ask me what to do
My advice to you today
Is to tell her how you really feel
Or you'll have some dues to pay
She made promises to you
Promises of good things to come
But they never do
