Lyrics:


You make me feel (so alive that I'm) trying hard not to (make moves, choosing the wrong place
and time) everyone will know, the minute we let it go. I can't hold it anymore, let's be
original.

No holds barred, can you feel it? Coming along, break the silence, non directional - No holds
barred can you feel it coming along, it's on. Hit the switch and turn me on.

You make me feel complicated, sometimes I try to explain the way you took me, turn it all
around, everyone will know the minute we let it go. I can't hold it anymore, let's be orignal.

No holds barred, can you feel it? Coming along, break the silence, non directional - No holds
barred can you feel it coming along, it's on. Hit the switch and turn me on. No holds barred,
can you feel it? Coming along, break the silence, non directional - No holds barred can you
feel it coming along, it's on. Hit the switch and turn me on.

I'm crawling my way through, I'm falling into you, I'm turning on things I thought I knew. I'm
slippin away, everytime I try to be more like you. 

No holds barred, can you feel it? Coming along, break the silence, non directional - No holds
barred can you feel it coming along, it's on. Hit the switch and turn me on. No holds barred,
can you feel it? Coming along, break the silence, non directional - No holds barred can you
feel it coming along, it's on. Hit the switch and turn me on.

Let's get it on. If you feel it coming on, If your real then come along if you feel the song.
Come on, bring it on, bring it on. Let's get it on, if you feel it coming on. If your real then
come along, if you feel the song, Come on bring it on, bring it on. Let's get it on. If you
feel it coming on, If your real then come along if you feel the song. Come on, bring it on,
bring it on. Let's get it on, if you feel it coming on. If your real then come along, if you
feel the song, Come on bring it on, bring it on.
