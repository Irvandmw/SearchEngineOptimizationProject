Lyrics:


Since the beginning of time
Since it started to rain
Since I heard your laugh
Since I felt your pain

I was too young, you were much younger
We were afraid of each other's hunger

I have always loved you
There's never been anyone else
I knew you before I knew myself
Oh my baby, I have always loved you

Since we kissed the first time
Since we slept on the beach
You were too close for comfort
You were too far out of reach

You walked away, I should have held you
Would you have stayed for me to tell you?

I have always loved you
There's never been anyone else
I knew you before I knew myself
oh my baby, I have always loved you

Years go by in a matter of daysâ
And though we go our separate ways
I never stop dreaming of you
I have always loved you

When you call it makes me cry
We never made time for you and I
If I could live it all again
I'd never let it end, I'd still be with you
Oh God, I miss you

I have always loved you

I knew you before I knew myself
oh my baby, I have always loved you

Years go by in a matter of days
And though we go our separate ways
I never stop dreaming of you
I have always loved you

I have always loved you
I have always loved you

I have always loved you
