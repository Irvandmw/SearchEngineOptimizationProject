Lyrics:


Keep your chin up when you're feeling lonely
Don't let them get you down
Ain't no use in sitting all alone
Hangin' around for someone to call
Ohh they won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide even if it hurts you inside
So I said give as good as you get

If you can't beat them join them
You better do it 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them join them
You're never gonna help yourself

Come on go get up, hey
Sure feels good

Keep your big hands off of my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're taking me out to wine and dine me
Trying to wind me round and around
And bind me to your little contract Ha! Ha!
Rumour has it that you could it play dirty
I tell you what I'll do about that, that yeah
I'll play you at your own game

If you can't beat them join them
You better do it 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them join them
You're never gonna help yourself

That's good play it again

If you can't beat them join them
You better do it 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them join them
It's everyone for themselves
