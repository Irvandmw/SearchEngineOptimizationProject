Lyrics:


The knife of insight tore its way in me
A bad collision without sympathy
And maybe when the sun goes down
Come 'round, or come out
Maybe we could take some time
Unwind, figure out
When the knife of insight tore its way in me

Don't hit me up if you're feeling down
Give a little, oh I'll figure this out
Keep me up, keep my mind turned 'round
After dark, after light
Let it go if you won't get love
Make a little fuss, so we taller now
Beautiful how it all pours out
After dark, after light
After dark, after light

Oh, the knife of insight brought me to my knees
Broke me down and taught me how to see
And I know, and I know, and I know
That maybe we should take some time, get this out, make this right
Maybe when the sun goes down, come 'round, tell you all about
When the knife of insight brought me to my knees

Don't hit me up if you're feeling down
Give a little, oh I'll figure this out
Keep me up, keep my mind turned 'round
After dark, after light
Let it go if you won't get love
Spark a little, oh we taller now
Beautiful how it all pours out
After dark, after light
Whoa, after dark, after light
Oh, oh

Now maybe I'm crazy, maybe you know
But I've got this feeling, it's all 'bout to blow
Maybe I'm crazy, or maybe you know that
I've got this feeling, it's all about to blow
And the knife, the knife, the knife
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh hit me up if you're feeling down
Give a little, oh I'll figure this out
Keep me up, keep my mind turned 'round
After dark, after light
Let it go if you won't get love
Love a little, oh we taller now
Beautiful how it all pours out
After dark, after light
Oh, after dark, after light
After dark, after light
Oh, oh
Beautiful, down below
Oh it's all after dark

And the knife
Oh, the knife
Oh
