Lyrics:


Well, when I'm wemblin' west
I take the friend I like best
So we can wemble wemble wemble side by side
And when we're wemblin' south
We stick a treat in our mouth
And we just wemble wemble wemble as we ride
So now it's
Doo doo doodly-doo zop
Diddly-dop doo daba doo dop doo
Because a wemblin' song can't go wrong
Yes it's a
Doo doo doodly-doo zop
Diddly-dop doo
Just a wemblin' on

We wemble most to the East
And North we wemble the least
But still we wemble wemble wemble along
Come on and wemble and you'll
Be just a wembling fool
'Cause that's the wimble wamble wemblin' song (oh yea!)
And it's a
Doo doo doodly-doo zop
Diddly-dop doo daba doo dop doo
Because a wembling song can't go wrong
Yes it's a
Doo doo doodly-doo zop
Diddly-dop doo doo
Doobie doo dop dop a diddly-dop
Squeep a-dop a-doo
Just wemblin' on
