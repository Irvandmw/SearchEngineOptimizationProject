Lyrics:


Once the last drop of rain, has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
You leave it muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls
Of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how we used to be
Like the dollar in your pocket, that's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

I lived, and I learned, had you
Got burned
Held out, held on
God knows, too long, you wasted my time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
No amount of freedom, gets you clean
I still got you all over me

Guess the worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "don't you wish you had me" grin
I did, so I smile, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of back then

Well I lived, and I learned, had you
Got burned
Held out, held on
God knows, too long, you wasted my time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
No amount of freedom gets you clean
I still got you all over me

I lived, and I learned, and found out what it was to turn around
And see that we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I tried, and I watched a part of myself die
No amount of freedom, gets you clean
I still got you all over me
I still got you all over me
...
