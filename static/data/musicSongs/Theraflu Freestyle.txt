Lyrics:


My bank account telling me to calm down
The billboards telling me to climb down
Ha, niggas pillow talking, let me find out
Could give a fuck about later bitch Iâm on now
Ha, you know the shine is what I do though
Bitch, you know Iâm flexing about a necklace and a 2 doâ
Monday in the Rolly, Tuesday in the Hublot
RnB killing rap niggas, thatâs just what I do though

These niggas is lame, they always complain and doing the same shit
Get all up on twitter, tryna get followers, sucking the same dÂ¡ck
Iâm tired of these niggas, tired of arguing over the same bitch
Niggas funny like comics, Iâm wealthy nigga, I ain't rich
My shit be up in galleries, a million when I paint bitch
Pop records bought me this Ferrari, thatâs a lane switch
Switch it up on you niggas watch my number change
Grown up on you niggas, yeah my number changed

Hit-boy, all these rappers wasting beats
I bought all my clique toys, ain't no niggas wasting heat
Yeah I cop that big noise, aka Iâm TNT
I blow that shit up, get up
Cause boy you canât get rid of
Donât fuck with my old bitch, itâs like a bad fur
Every industry nigga done had her
Trick or treat like a pumpkin just to smash her
Bitches breaking codes, but Iâm the password

Now itâs time for young niggas to shut down shit
If you yapping in the club then you surrounded
They say he tripping, on some greyhound shit
He didnât listen, now he listening to the ground bitch
Put him out, heâs sleeping
With all the sneakers on his chest, he barely breathing
Like itâs lights out, he took a beating
Hand on his chest, holding his heart, pledge of allegiance
Damn, his bitch cold, need a Theraflu
Took âem shopping, bought âem 1500 pair of shoes
Ha, Theraflu
Iâm a cold ass nigga, fuck you!
