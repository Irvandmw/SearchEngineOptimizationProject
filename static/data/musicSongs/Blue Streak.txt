Lyrics:


Pinnacle at the top

Did this business get back for years
Martin Lawrence on the blue streak
Young nigga keep a choppa on me
So we can kick it like Bruce Lee
Fled the club I like charity
VVS got the clarity
So all these bitches wanna marry me
I drink the Codeine for the therapy
Aye, I had to go break the glass and call the safe
Yesterday I was wearing a mask and now I'm gon ball today
I just go to the Valentino's I can't fuck with the mall today
Bitch we came from the penny cause we was learning it the Hardaway

My jewelry, my jewelry, my jewelry, jewelry, my jewelry, my jewelry, my jewelry
I hop out the Lamb, she looking like damn
My wrist is Oreo McFlurry
Putting racks in a duffel bag
We was beatin cases fuck the jury
Feds tryna see a nigga location
I be turning off the Siri
Just hopped out the jet
Call up Elliot I need to protect
Told that bitch just to flex
I sold a OT and she rode with the rest
While that bitch giving me neck
And I get tired of all the fakin baby
Good with all o that conversation baby
You ain't giving you just taking baby, yeah yeah
Sat down stack it up had to get my head right
Drinking, I was out finessing I was getting bread right
We was whipping up the soda then we seen the Fed lights
Whoo...
Pinnacle at the top

Did this business get back for years
Martin Lawrence on the blue streak
Young nigga keep a choppa on me
So we can kick it like Bruce Lee
Fled the club I like charity
VVS got the clarity
So all these bitches wanna marry me
I drink the Codeine for the therapy
Aye, I had to go break the glass and call the safe
Yesterday I was wearing a mask and now I'm gon ball today
I just go to the Valentino's I can't fuck with the mall today
Bitch we came from the penny cause we was learning it the Hardaway

Gotta get it over chink
Grab a bag from the brink
Young niggas gotta eat
Bust a glass and hope I run up them digits
Put baby mama in a mink
I was busting them dishonest niggas
Robbing, how the fuck you think
Pay the manner with the passing nigga
Keep the Codeine in the drink
Run a check just to fuck it up
I was down bad, lonely
I was acting crazy for fifty
I take my family out, it's on me
Coup white like cocaine
25 for the barman
Always know to keep an ounce in the zipper
Never knowin when I gotta deliver
Sure I got money to lend you but you know you flexin
I pull in Audi turn that bitch into pedestrian
Getting money you know that ain't the question
Yeah, I'm getting money you know that ain't the question

Did this business get back for years
Martin Lawrence on the blue streak
Young nigga keep a choppa on me
So we can kick it like Bruce Lee
Fled the club I like charity
VVS got the clarity
So all these bitches wanna marry me
I drink the Codeine for the therapy
Aye, I had to go break the glass and call the safe
Yesterday I was wearing a mask and now I'm gon ball today
I just go to the Valentino's I can't fuck with the mall today
Bitch we came from the penny cause we was learning it the Hardaway
