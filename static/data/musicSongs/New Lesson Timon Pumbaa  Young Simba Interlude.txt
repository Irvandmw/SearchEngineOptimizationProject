Lyrics:


[JD McCrary:]
Who are you?

[Seth Rogen:]
I'm Pumbaa, this is Timon

[Billy Eichner:]
Look, kid
Bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?

[JD McCrary:]
Right

[Billy Eichner:]
Wrong!
When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world

[Seth Rogen:]
Only embrace what's next

[Billy Eichner:]
And turn the "what" into "so what?"

[JD McCrary:]
Well, that's not what I was taught

[Billy Eichner:]
Well then maybe you need a new lesson
Repeat after me, kid
Hakuna Matata
