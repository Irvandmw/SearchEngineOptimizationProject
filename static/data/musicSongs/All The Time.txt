Lyrics:


I think about you all the time, time
Got me right here waitin'
I think about you all the time
Got me right here waitin'
You ain't know you was my baby (that's my baby)
Even though you drive me crazy
Bet you ain't know you my baby
And you know you drive me crazy

She run up a check, fuck a Patek
I run up them digits
I fuck up the bed, left it a mess, do you remember? (Remember)
You know you was the best, you was the best
Ain't no pretender, oh
Doing things you said you never would, would, would
I call you late at night, I ain't no good, good, good
Let me eat that pussy, that's my pussy diet
You know most these niggas pussy they canât try it

I think about you all the time, time
Got me right here waitin'
I think about you all the time (all the time, all the time)
Got me right here waitin'
You ain't know you was my baby (that's my baby)
Even though you drive me crazy
Bet you ain't know you my baby
And you know you drive me crazy

If you don't want me, baby
Why my number never blocked?
Tell me why, girl don't lie, cause i want this shit to stop
All this negative energy
We don't need to be we're not enemies
Only time we get rough
Baby when I'm fucking it up
Giving you all that real love
Putting in overtime, working real hard
I'm tryna steal your heart
It's not always about the diamonds and ice that I buy
It's just a little milestone for a life time

I think about you all the time, time
Got me right here waitin'
I think about you all the time
Got me right here waitin'
You ain't know you was my baby
Even though you drive me crazy
Bet you ain't know you my baby
And you know you drive me crazy
