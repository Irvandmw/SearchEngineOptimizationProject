Lyrics:


[Alicia Keys:]
Funny thing about the apple
The peach is sweet, but ain't the same
The pear compares, but that's natural
This ain't no [?]

[Pharrell Williams:]
You turn my ovens on (Flame)
You can smell when it's warm (Flame)
Burn the house to the lawn (Flame)
Happens quick as they on (Flame)

[Alicia Keys:]
It was Adam and Eve
And the God in the trees
And the snake, oh yeah
Cause everybody is destined
To learn all these lessons alone
Don't be afraid

This gon' wake you up (woo-woo)
Smell when it hit the flame (woo-woo)
Hurry 'for it burn up (woo-woo)
Cause it won't be the same (woo-woo)

[Pharrell Willians:]
It's funny when the arrow's aiming at you
Inscribed with your name
You pray that it just goes past you
Cupid's only gonna shoot if he knows it's his game

You turn my ovens on (Flame)
You can smell when it's warm (Flame) (Lucy Liu!)
Burn the house to the lawn (Flame)
Happens quick as they on (Flame)

[Alicia Keys:]
It was Adam and Eve
And the God in the trees
And the snake, oh yeah
Cause everybody is destined
To learn all these lessons alone
Don't be afraid

This gon' wake you up (woo-woo)
Smell when it hit the flame (woo-woo)
Hurry 'for it burn up (woo-woo)
Cause it won't be the same (woo-woo)

[Pharrell Williams:]
Hey baby, I'm bananas about you
Oh girl, I lose control
Life would be nuts without you
I got this heart shaped bowl
Cover my soul

Can I have a bite?

You know that Harlem isn't here right now
Okay, one two three, stop

[Pharrell Williams:]
You turn my ovens on (Flame)
You can smell when it's warm (Flame)
Burn the house to the lawn (Flame)
Happen quick as they on (Flame)

[Alicia Keys:]
It was Adam and Eve
And the God in the trees
And the snake, oh yeah
Cause everybody is destined
To learn all these lessons alone
Don't be afraid

This gon' wake you up (woo-woo)
Smell when it hit the flame (woo-woo)
Hurry 'for it burn up (woo-woo)
Cause it won't be the same (woo-woo)
