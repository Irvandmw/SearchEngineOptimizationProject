Lyrics:


If you think you got troubles buddy, listen to me
I'm not standin' on this corner gazing at the moon you see
Don't you tell me your troubles, got enough of my own
'Cause this lonely corner's got me where I used to walk her home

All these long and weary evening's when the hurtin's close the day
I'm still standin' on this corner where we'd kiss the nights away
Please go take all your troubles, got enough of my own
'Cause this lonely corner's got me where I used to walk her home

Lonely corner, where can she be?
Lonely corner, you're just the place to dwell and your full of misery

Just a chance to hold my baby would release these binding chains
Take me from this lonely corner, we could start our life again
But until the day I see her, I'll be standin' all alone
On this lonely corner where I used to walk my baby home
On this lonely corner where I used to walk my baby home
On this lonely corner where I used to walk my baby home
