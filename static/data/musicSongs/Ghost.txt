Lyrics:


Why don't we kill the lights?
I'm no good at hiding underneath a sea of tears
Flood, pouring through my eyes
I can't even close 'em, I can't even see you clear

And when you're looking in the mirror
Demons may be closer than they may appear
You can either cry, and sit, and stare
Or try to run away, I'm tryna run away

I'm staring at a ghost
I'm staring at a ghost

Why don't we take a walk?
Everybody knows a hand to hold is all we need
Quiet (Shh), let's not even talk
Every word I say to you, you only just repeat

And when you're looking in the mirror
Demons may be closer than they may appear
You can either cry, and sit, and stare
Or try to run away, I'm tryna run away

I'm staring at a ghost
I'm staring at a ghost

Letters on our hands we never understand
Living just to die another day
Powder on our face carries us away
Reaching for a dream that always fades
Madness in a smile
Won't you stay a while?

I'm staring at a ghost
I'm staring at a ghost
I'm staring at a ghost
