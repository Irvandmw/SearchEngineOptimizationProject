Lyrics:


Another night, you're out again
On the town, you're running around
You're playing with my emotions
When will this ever end?
True love is about forgiving
I see your face and my head starts spinning
I'm such a fool, but I can't help loving you

My fallen angel, well I love you so
My heart would take you back
But my head says to let you go

You're troubled girl, in every way
But I'd take you back
No matter what they say
You've got a reputation
I don't listen to what they say
Even though I'm hurting badly
I can see them all laughing at me
I'm such a fool, but I can't help loving you

My fallen angel, well I love you so
My heart would take you back
But my head says to let you go

How can you judge a simple man (a simple man)
I'm moving on the best I can (best I can)
They don't know you like I do
I've forgiven all the pain you put me through

My fallen angel, well I love you so
My heart would take you back
But my head says to let you go
My heart would take you back
But my head says to let you go
