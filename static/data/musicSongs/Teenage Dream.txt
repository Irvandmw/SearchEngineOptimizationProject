Lyrics:


I think you're pretty, without any make-up on
I think you're funny, when you tell the punch line wrong
I know you got me
So I let my walls fall down, down

Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine

So let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a
Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
'Cause my heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, let's take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to LA, got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a house out of sheets
I finally got you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

So let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a
Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
'Cause my heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, let's take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

'Cause I can feel your heart racing in my skin tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you rest your hands on me in my skin tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

'Cause you make me feel like I'm living a
Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
'Cause my heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, let's take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
