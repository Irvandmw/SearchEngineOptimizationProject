Song Name: (Because) It's Christmastime
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I hear sleigh bells ringing
And the children singing
Winter stars are shining bright
For everyone, it's Christmastime
Holiday faces glowing
Sentimental feelings showing
I'll recall old friends I won't forget
Because it's Christmas time

As I walk along the avenue
There's a brass quartet performing through the night
Drop a handful in the hat, it's what we always do
The spirit of the season reminds us of the reason

I give you a hat
You give me some gloves
Kids got their toys
But what does it mean?
What does it say about love,
About peace and good will?

The world in such confusion
Kindness is the sweet solution
Take my hand as I reach out
Because it's Christmas time

As I walk along the avenue
There's a brass quartet performing through the night
Drop a handful in the hat, it's what we always do
The spirit of the season reminds us of the reason
