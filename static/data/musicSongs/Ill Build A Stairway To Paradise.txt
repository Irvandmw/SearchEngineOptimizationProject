Lyrics:


All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Heaven.

It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;

Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practise,
Here's the thing to do,
Simply say as you go...

[Chorus:]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Step aside, I'm on my way!
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes! Come on and carry me there!
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.
Ok, with a new step every day.

I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes! Come on and carry me there!
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.

I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes! Get up and carry me there!
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.
