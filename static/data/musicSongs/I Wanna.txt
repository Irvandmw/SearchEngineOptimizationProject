Lyrics:


She turn down by the way
She got that coke bottle shape, somethin' 'bout her face
She from Broadway
She wanna hoop to my place
Wanna know how it taste

Baby girl, you know you fine, fine
Never laid your own time, time
Tear that pussy up, mine, mine
Tonight
Get it, pop your chest, it's Mardi Gras
Couple, couple baggies hangin' down
Choose just to feed your appetite
I-I-I

Oh, you don't need the sun to see it rise (oh)
Ain't no need to lie
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (go)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (go)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Go, yeah

She turn down by the way
She got that coke bottle shape, somethin' 'bout her face
She from Broadway
She wanna hoop to my place
Wanna know how it taste

Listen, babe, I know you right, right
You keep on giving me the high, yeah
You and I gon' light a fire
Tonight
Baby girl, don't change your mind, mind
Why we here just dancin' all night
This PatrÃ³n got a little cheap like
I-I-I

Oh, you don't need the sun to see it rise (oh)
Ain't no need to lie
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (go)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (go)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Go, yeah

She turn down by the way
She got that coke bottle shape, somethin' 'bout her face
She from Broadway
She wanna hoop to my place
Wanna know how it taste

I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

Oh, you don't need the sun to see it rise
Ain't no need to lie

She turn down by the way
She got that coke bottle shape, somethin' 'bout her face
She from Broadway
She wanna hoop to my place
Wanna know how it taste
