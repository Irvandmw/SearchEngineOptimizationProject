Lyrics:


Don't hold yourself like that
'Cause you'll hurt your knees
Well I kissed your mouth and back
But that's all I need

Don't build your world around
Volcanoes melt you down

And what I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea

Don't throw yourself like that
In front of me
Well, I kissed your mouth, your back, now
Is that all you need?

Don't drag my love around
Volcanoes melt me down

And what I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask...

For what I give to you
Is just what I'm going through
This is nothing new
No, no, just another phase of...
Finding what I really need
Is what makes me bleed
And like a new disease, Lord
She's still too young to dream

Volcanoes melt you down [x10]
She's still too young [x8]
You do not need me
Is not what you mean to me
You do not need me
You do not need me
