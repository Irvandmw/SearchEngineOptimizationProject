Lyrics:


A man went to Africa to meet with the primitive
The man was very brave and not afraid
Didn't come there to enslave anyone

And it scared him, and though it sacred him
His intuition told him he'd better go
Back to Vienna
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)

Now the man was eager to find out all about the primitive mind
He was very sensitive, was very patient
Realized that he was looking into a mirror at himself

And it scared him, and though it sacred him
His intuition told him he'd better go
Back to Vienna
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)

Now he asked the native wise men, what do your dreams tell you now
They said "Since the white man came we're no longer able to dream
The white man knows it all"

And that scared him, and though it sacred him
He began havin' dreams himself that told him he'd better go
Back to Vienna
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
Now he thought about the primitive mind and he read about the ancient times
But when he slipped back a few thousand years and his heart locked up
He realized it was powerful stuff

And it scared him, you know it sacred him
His intuition told him he'd better go
Back to Vienna
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
Back to the white man
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
Back to Vienna
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
Up North
(Go back, go back)
(Go back, go back)
