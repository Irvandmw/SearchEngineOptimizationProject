Lyrics:


The world is cracked
The sky is torn
Iâm hanging in
Youâre holding on

I canât pretend
That nothings changed
Living in the shadows
Of the love we made

Backâ¦When we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Backâ¦ When we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Letâs go back and find it

Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la 
Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la

Some dreams live 
Some will die
But the you and me
Is still alive 

Now am I blessed?
Or am I cursed?
Cause the way we are
Aint the way we were

Backâ¦When we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Backâ¦ When we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Letâs go back and find it

[Solo]

The world is cracked
The sky is torn
So much less
Meant so much more

Backâ¦When we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Backâ¦ When we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Letâs go back and find it

Backâ¦When we were beautiful
Backâ¦When we were beautiful
Backâ¦When we were beautiful
Backâ¦When we were beautiful

Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la 
Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la
