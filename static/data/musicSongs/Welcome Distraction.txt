Lyrics:


I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy 
When I let too much go
Loveâs a little messy and you are too
Right now Iâm scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasnât gonna stray 
Swore Iâd never let a man in my way

Youâre the last thing I needed today

And I donât know 
Where I lost control
And couldnât take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I canât win so I give in 
The more I fight it just getâs stronger
Youâre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee 
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Canât talk to my friends 
Without you coming up
Itâs even kind of cute 
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down 
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good 
Right next to mine

Youâre the last thing I needed tonight

And I donât know 
Where I lost control
And couldnât take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I canât win so I give in 
The more I fight it just getâs stronger
Youâre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

Iâm acting like a girl 
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring 
About anything but you

And I donât know 
Where I lost control
And couldnât take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I canât win so I give in 
The more I fight it just getâs stronger
Youâre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh oh
