Lyrics:


When you love like a mother
Love like a father
Love me love love me more
Ye you talk like leader
Walk like a follower
Baby you should love me
Love love love me more

You sweet sweeter than most
But that's all that I can saying
Ye I'm sure you love me so
But I don't know what fucking saying,
Back I was young like a jar
And I was too too fast falls
Now you are hoping
That I say you back

When you love like a mother
Love like a father
Love me love love me more
Ye you talk like leader
Walk like a follower
Baby you should love me
Love me love me more

Like my dad you say I'm the best
But I don't really wanna hear that
At times ye you can be cute, cute
But no cuter than my little bro
And you. You gotta go cause 
I can deal with a boy
You doesn't even know I ever 
You don't understand just what I mean,
When all I'm trying to say is you 

Love like a mother
Love like a father
Love me love love me
Love me love me more
You talk like leader
Walk like a follower
Baby you should love me
Love love love me more

Love me more, yea
Love me better
Can you show me
That your love will last forever
[x4]

Love like a mother
Love like a father
Love me love love me
Now love love me more
Talk like leader
Walk like a follower
Baby you should love me
Love love love me more

Love like a mother
Love like a father
Love me love love me
So love me love me more
Talk like leader
And walk like a follower
Baby you should love me
Love love love me more
