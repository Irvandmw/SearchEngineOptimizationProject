Lyrics:


I'm in love with a song bird
I'm in love with a vision of you in my head
And it's all I needed
I'm in love with a sweet dream
In a rapturous day glowing
Feeling instead of me mistreated

Your love is light
In the middle of the deep blue night
So clear and bright
Telling me I'm gonna be alright

Walk away if you want to
Don't be afraid of telling the truth
I don't mind, I've been down, too
Maybe this is a blessing
Being here in the twilight of magical times
To walk beside you

Your love is light
In the middle of the deep blue night
So clear and bright
Telling me I'm gonna be alright

Your love is light
In the middle of the deep blue night
So clear and bright
Telling me I'm gonna be alright
