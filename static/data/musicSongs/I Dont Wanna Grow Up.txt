Lyrics:


I don't wanna grow up, no
I don't wanna grow up
I'm still naive
Young, wild and free
I don't wanna hear it, no
I don't wanna feel it
Don't lecture me
Just let me be

If love is a lie, it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
'Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
If love is a lie, then please don't ever tell me the truth
Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you

I don't wanna live it, no
I don't wanna live it
Reality
Just not for me
Like cheap tequila
Makes you sick but it tastes so good
It is good on your lips
Take a sip
Just one more hit
I love it when you do it, when you do it like this
When you do it, when you do it like this

If love is a lie, it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
'Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
If love is a lie, then please don't ever tell me the truth
Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
If love is a lie, it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
'Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
(If love is a lie, is a lie)
If love is a lie, it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
'Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
If love is a lie, then please don't ever tell me the truth
Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon...)
