Lyrics:


Itâs a cold and crazy world thatâs raginâ outside
Well baby me and all my girls are bringinâ on the fire
Show a little leg, gotta shimmy your chest
Itâs a life, itâs a style, itâs a need, itâs Burlesque

E-X-P-R-E-S-S, love, sex
Ladies no regrets
E-X-P-R-E-S-S, love, sex
Ladies no regrets

Been holding back for quite some time and finally the momentâs right
I love to make the people stare
They know I got that certain savoir-faire

Fasten up
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch?
Step into the fantasy
Youâll never want to leave, baby that's guaranteedâ¦ Why?

Itâs a passion, an emotion, itâs a fashion, Burlesque.
Itâll move you, goinâ through you, so do what I do, Burlesque
All ladies confident, flaunt it, boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it? Itâs Burlesque.

Le le le le le le le
Burlesque
Le le le le le le le
Burlesque

I tease âem âtil theyâre on the edge
They scream and moan for more and more they beg.
I know itâs me they come to see
My pleasure brings them to their knees

Fasten up
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch?
Step into the fantasy
Youâll never want to leave, baby that's guaranteedâ¦ Why?

Itâs a passion, an emotion, itâs a fashion, Burlesque
Itâll move you, goinâ through you, so do what I do, Burlesque
All ladies, confident, flaunt it, boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it? Itâs Burlesque.

Le le le le le lele
Burlesque
Le le le le le le le
Burlesque [x4]

Itâs a passion, an emotion, itâs a fashion, Burlesque
Itâll move you, goinâ through you, so do what I do, Burlesque
All ladies confident, flaunt it, boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it? Itâs Burlesque.
