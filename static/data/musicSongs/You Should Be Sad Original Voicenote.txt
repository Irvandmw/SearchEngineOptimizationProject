Lyrics:


I'm gonna start this out by saying
I need to get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
And no, nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
I'm gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs or cars
And I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you will never ever touch me again
I won't see your alligator tears
'Cause, no, I've had enough of them

Gonna start this out by saying
I really meant well from the start
Thought I'd take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls or cars
And I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

Oh, I feel so sorry
I feel so sad
I tried to help you
It just made you mad
And I had no warning
About who you are
Thought I'd take a broken man, put him in my hands and
Fuck that, oh my go

I hate myself
So close
Oh, whatever, you get the point
