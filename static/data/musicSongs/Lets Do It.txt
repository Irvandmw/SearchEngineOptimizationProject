Lyrics:


[Verse 1:]
Tonight I can't believe that this is over
Tonight I can't believe our love will end
So many things I wish I would have told you
So many things I wish we could have been
So we didn't have forever girl, but we got tonight

[Chorus:]
Let's do it one more time (come on)
Let's do it one last night (come on)
Let's do it for the memories of when we had it right
Let's do it for the good (come on)
Let's do it for the bad (come on)
Let's do it for the sex that we may never have again
Let's do it one more time (come on)
Let's do it one more time

[2x] (Lets do it, (oh,oh) lets do it)

[Verse 2:]
I hate you, but I love the way you touch me
I hate you, but I miss your tender kisses
If we could only have another moment
Another night like we did way back when
Well, we didn't have forever, but we've got tonight

[Chorus:]
Let's do it one more time (come on)
Let's do it one last night (come on)
Let's do it for the memories of when we had it right
Let's do it for the good (come on)
Let's do it for the bad (come on)
Let's do it for the sex that we may never have again
Let's do it one more time (come on)
Let's do it one more time

[4x] (Lets do it, (oh,oh) lets do it)

So we didn't have forever girl, but we've got tonight

[Chorus:]
Let's do it one more time (come on)
Let's do it one last night (come on)
Let's do it for the memories of when we had it right
Let's do it for the good (come on)
Let's do it for the bad (come on)
Let's do it for the sex that we may never have again
Let's do it one more time
Let's do it one more time (come on)
Let's do it one more time (come on)
Let's do it one more time

[Til' fade out]
(Lets do it, (oh,oh) lets do it)
