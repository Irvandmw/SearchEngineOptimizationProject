Lyrics:


They tell me the best in life is free
And I feel spent so I guess it means that the best is mine
But it doesnât seem so
While Iâm out here confessing things
All last year got the best of me
And Iâm not sure Iâm ready for another go
Itâs New Yearâs Day

Euphoriaâs gone, itâs time to move on
I have to believe we can change
When the notes come out wrong
Stop singing along
We canât be the same old thing
Itâs New Yearâs Day

Iâm tearing down the past years off the wall (itâs New Yearâs Day)
Iâm coming at you like a wrecking ball (itâs New Yearâs Day)
And I think Iâm gonna make it after all
Itâs New Yearâs Day

I said sometimes I canât stand myself
And most times I wish I could be anyone else
When I look in the mirror my eyes are getting old
And she said yeah I see your point of view
But it could be just a phase that youâre going through
And it feels like we could make something beautiful
Itâs New Yearâs Day

Iâm tearing down the past years off the wall (itâs New Yearâs Day)
Iâm coming at you like a wrecking ball (itâs New Yearâs Day)
And I think Iâm gonna make it after all
Itâs New Yearâs Day

Euphoriaâs gone, itâs time to move on
I have to believe we can change
When the notes come out wrong
Stop singing along
We canât be the same old thing
Itâs New Yearâs Day

Iâm tearing down the past years off the wall (itâs New Yearâs Day)
Iâm coming at you like a wrecking ball (itâs New Yearâs Day)
And I think Iâm gonna make it after all
Yeah I think weâre gonna make it after all
And I think Iâm gonna make it after all
Itâs New Yearâs Day

I think weâre gonna make it after all (itâs gonna be okay)
Yeah I think weâre gonna make it after all (itâs gonna okay)
Yeah I think weâre gonna make it after all
Itâs New Yearâs Day
