Lyrics:


(Oh I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses)

I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses one for every time you've broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes tears will fall like petals when we part

I've begged you to be different but you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgivin' now there's nothin' left to do
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you've broke my heart

(I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses)

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you've broke my heart
One for every time you've broke my heart
