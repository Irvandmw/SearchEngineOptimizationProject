Lyrics:


Mama, mama
What's this strange, strange
Mama
Mama, what's this strange, strange
Mama
Why the butterflies?

Mama, mama what's this shaking in me?
Mama, what's this crazy swirling around?
Mama, why the butterflies?

Mama, mama
Open visions in my mind, Mama
Mama
Mama, what's this
Mama, what's this
Mama, mama, mama
Why the butterflies?
Why the butterflies?

Oh, oh oh

Mama, where is father?
Mama, butterflies
Mama, where is father?
Mama, where
Mama, where
Mama, where
Why butterflies?

Mama
Where am I?
What's this strange, strange
Why the butterflies?
