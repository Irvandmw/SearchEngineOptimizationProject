Lyrics:


Rearrange your mind
Man, you've got to be drunk!
You think we'd stoop so low and play that old-time funk?
Rearrange your mind
Loosen up your hair!
You gotta do things in a different way
If you wanna get anywhere (Dig it!)

People today won't change
Got to rearrange
Kids today won't love
The kind we're dreaming of
Your music won't make me dance
I won't give it half a chance
People today won't change
Re-e-e-arrange

Rearrange your brain
Dial a brand new number
Just can't stay the same
Ain't nothing funky 'bout a waltz or rumba
Rearrange your brain
Got to free your mind!
Your hair, your clothes, your body, your soul
Won't be far behind! (Sing it!)

People today won't change
Got to rearrange
Kids today won't love
The kind we're dreaming of
Your music won't make me dance
I won't give it half a chance
People today won't change
Re-e-e-arrange

Got to rearrange
Oh
You got to rearrange
Hey, hey

People today won't change
Got to rearrange
Kids today won't love
The kind we're dreaming of
Your music won't make me dance
Won't give it half a chance
People today won't change
Re-e-e-arrange

People today won't change
Got to rearrange
Kids today won't love
The kind we're dreaming of
Your music won't make me dance
Won't give it half a chance
People today won't change
Re-e-e-arrange

Rearrange, rearrange, got to rearrange
People today won't change
Re-e-e-arrange
Rearrange, rearrange, got to rearrange
People today won't change
Re-e-e-arrange
