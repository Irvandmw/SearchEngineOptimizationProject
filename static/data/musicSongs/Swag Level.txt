Lyrics:


My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?

First it was the Glock going hand to hand
Then I got to moving the gram by gram
Your boy get bread, thatâs without a doubt
One by one, I knocks them out

I get that paper nigga, I get that paper
Benz on chrome shoes, crib sitting on mad acres
If I donât get it on this time, Iâll get it on the next flip
Ball blowing them bottles and creep off with the next bitch
Itâs recreation all, when itâs nothing to do
Fuck up a hater or two, or send a nigga at you
Gem star will scratch you, [?] youâre just a rapper
In fact, youâre a regular rapper
Say the wrong line and Iâll get your ass wrapped up
Bass line bumping, whole spot dumping
Like [?] to my niggas, get the [?] pumping
I blow bread nigga, heavy bread
It was rip to big now heavy dead
Now all the fat bitches ask if it was something [?]

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread

And I be swagging all day, I be swagging all day
Iâm from NY, but I fuck with [?]
When Iâm out in the bay feels like home sweet home
Now niggas canât fuck with the shit Iâm on
Warrup [?] donât get it fucked up
A nigga spot pumping out, get you stuck up
Out of habit, I got bad habits
Sem autos, and fully automatics
Click clack it, ra-ta-ta-tat it
Clap clap shit, reload, clap clap shit
I been doing this I donât need practice
I been doing this I donât need practice

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
