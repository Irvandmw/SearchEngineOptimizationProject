Back on the bonty
I just put my bitch back in the bonty
I just, I just put my bitch back in the bonty
I just put my bitch back in the...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Pull up in Jeep, we forty feet
Guess what I'm grinding for petit felipe
My niggas is starving so we fed the streets
I pull up sliding on these niggas beep beep
Young nigga grinding
Cause I put that time in
Shout out to Hollywood, check out my diamonds yeah
But let's stay [?] nigga
I on't do no violence
Your man keep talking but we really bout it
Yeah I was just broke but I never talk cheap
Bed bugs tryna bite a nigga I done lost sleep
And now I'm getting money niggas know they lost me
I just put my bitch back in Givenchy, yeah yeah

I might pull up in broad day
Got them killers on me
Got banana clips you know we got guerillas on me
I might take all a ma niggas we out on vacation
Mama told me all it took was motivation
I might cash out on the baddest bitch
Yeah and straight that bitch for another bitch
It don't take long for me to grab a bitch
She sip my semen like it's [?]

Niggas know I make it happen
Tryna get into a mansion
And I really love music
Tryna do a nigga passion
You don't want no blood
Young nigga got magic
And I got automatic
But I let a nigga have it
You rocking but that Roley fake my nigga
I got your bitches hold my grapes lil nigga
We fd the streets the whole damn table nigga
Ref roof make you feel like space
You niggas ain't cold
No you niggas ain't got it
My dogs is Hush Puppies, we moving silent
Yeah I'm such a clean nigga
I don't want no violence
Yeah but if a nigga nigga call me
Then I gotta find him so

I might pull up in broad day
Got them killers on me
Got banana clips you know we got guerillas on me
I might take all a ma niggas we out on vacation
Mama told me all it took was motivation
I might cash out on the baddest bitch
Yeah and trade that bitch for another bitch
It don't take long for me to grab a bitch
She sip my semen like it's [?]

We fed the street
I fed the street yeah

Young niggas was hungry
So I fed the street

Me and [?] we fed the streets
