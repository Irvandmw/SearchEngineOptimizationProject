Lyrics:


I took my loved one out to dinner
So we could get a bite to eat
And though we both had been much thinner
She looked so beautiful I could eat her
Well Well Well Oh Well

We sat and talked of revolution
just like to librals in the sun
we talked of womens liberation
and how the hell we could get thing done
Well Well Well Oh Well

I took my loved one to a big field
So we could watch the english sky
Were both feeling guilty
And neither one of us knew just why
Well Well Well Oh Well
