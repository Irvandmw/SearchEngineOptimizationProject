Lyrics:


Though you're far away from home,
Where the cold and lonely roam,
Don't forget the setting sun
Shines on everyone,
And you'll never be alone.

You'd give everything you own,
Saddle blanket, rope, and coat,
To be sitting by your side
Right at Christmas time,
And you'll never be alone.

Riding life for months on end
Is sure to set you thinking too much.
Been so long I can't remember when
The last time I felt your touch.

Though you're aching to the bone,
She loves you more than you will know.
Tell the trail to go to hell.
Just sing a Noel,
And you'll never be alone.
Woah!

[Guitar Interlude]

Yeah!
Riding life for months on end
Is sure to set you thinking too much.
It's been so long I can't remember when
The last time I felt your touch!

Though you're far away from home,
Where the cold and lonely roam,
Don't forget the setting sun
Shines on everyone,
And you'll never be alone.

I'll be sitting by your side,
Right at Christmas time,
And I'll never be alone!
