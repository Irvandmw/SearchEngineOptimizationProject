Lyrics:


You are my baby, I am your lady
I needed to say that
I am your woman, I am your home
And I want you to know that

We are the song, we can give me your hand
We can make it
We are the world, we can give it a whirl
We can make it
Make it home

You are my lover, you and no other
I promise to love you
You are my man, from here to the end
It's so easy to love you

We are the dream, we can be as we seem
We can make it
We are as real as this love we feel
We can make it

You loving me, loving you
We can make it
You loving me, loving you
We can make it

We are the reason we go on believing
That life is for living
And if life is the secret, then we have the key
That turns love into living

We are the song, we can give me your hand
We can make it
We are as real as this love that we feel
We can make it

You loving me, loving you
We can make it
You loving me, loving you
We can make it

You loving me, loving you
We can make it
You loving me, loving you
We can make it
