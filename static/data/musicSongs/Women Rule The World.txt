Lyrics:


I guess just about everything I've ever done
I've been tryin' to impress or get close to one of 'em
Seems like I was about thirteen
Bobbi Jo Guthrie was the pumpkin queen
That night I realized for the very first time
Women rule the world

The way they talk, the way they giggle
The way they walk, the way they jiggle
Makes men buy 'em diamonds and pearls
That look when they're up to something
Soft touch, oh that lovin'
They're sexy when they're mamas
Cute when they're girls
Women rule the world

We men like to think we're in control
We all want to be big shots
We like to think we run the show
The truth is with just the right smile
You ladies know you can drive us wild
Those mini-skirts and the way you flirt
You know just what works
Women rule the world

The way they talk, the way they giggle
The way they walk, the way they jiggle
Makes men buy 'em diamonds and pearls
That look when they're up to something
Soft touch, oh that lovin'
They're sexy when they're mamas
Cute when they're girls
Women rule the world

In all shapes and sizes
They make my temperature rise
Style and brains, the whole shebang
I'm here to say, women rule the world

That look when they're up to something
Soft touch, oh that lovin'
They're sexy when they're mamas
Cute when they're girls
Women rule the world
Women rule the world
Women rule the world
Women rule the world
