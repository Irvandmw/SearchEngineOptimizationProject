Lyrics:


Put down the weapons that you use against yourself
You don't need them anymore
Lay down the weapons that you use against the world
We don't need another war
Put down the weapons that you use against yourself
You don't need them anymore
Lay down the weapons that you use against the world
We don't need another war

My worst crime is an inside job
Dark thoughts taking over like an inside mob
I tune in to the scene between the eyes
And take a breath
I sit still and watch the thoughts flow past me
Never mind the future, never mind what the past be
I like to jump and let the Universe catch me
Free fall, watch the beauty blow past me
I keep my pockets light, destination in sight
I keep my actions elevated to compassionate heights
I'm walking pacified, laying down arms in the night
Choosing love when I pick up this mic, so we can

Make love, make love, not war
Make love, make love, not war
Make love, make love, not war
Make love, make love, make love, make love

World peace begins within
In each beat of the heart underneath our skin
Breathe and release the binds
You're holding and free your mind
Step back from the drama and observe it
Draw the energy in and conserve it
Every pain is a lesson for the learning
Mother Nature didn't make us to be murdering

Make love, make love, not war (Ah, it's a choice I make)
Make love, make love, not war
Make love, make love, not war (Ah, it's a choice I make)
Make love, make love, make love, make love

Find a project to dive in, a book you can write in
A dream you can fly in, a river to cry in
A magical trip to a fantasy island
It's our horizon to widen, our ceiling to heighten
Our mind to enlighten, our soul to divine in
A time to invite in a moment of silence
And we gon' dance it out
Loud and proud
'Cause I'm gon' show you how

When I pray (When I pray)
I move my feet (Move my feet)
And I say thank you for the sound
When I hear that beat
It brings me closer (Closer)
To who I am (Who I am)
And all I'm supposed to be right now
Is a giving man
And serve you water (Water)
From the living well (The living well)
Uh, to help another get out of their hell
Gotta give a little piece of yourself and

Make love, make love
Make love, make love
Yeah, we can help each other (Help each other)
Yeah, we can help each other (Help each other)
Yeah, we can make love, make love
Make love, make love
Yeah, we can help each other (Help each other)
Yeah, we can help each other (Help each other)
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
Make love, make love

Help each other
Help each other
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
