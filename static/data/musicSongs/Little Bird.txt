Lyrics:


If we take this bird in
With its broken leg
We could nurse it
She said
Come inside
For a little lie down with me
If you fall asleep
It wouldnât be the worst thing

But when I wake up
Your make-up is on my shoulder
And tell me, if I lie down
Would you stay now
And let me hold you?

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And itâs not complete yet
Mustnât get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And Iâll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird

If we take a walk out
In the morning dew
We could lay down
So Iâm next to you
Come inside
For a little home-made tea
If you fall asleep
Then at least youâre next to me

And if I wake up
You see, itâs late, love
Go back to sleep
Iâm covered by nature
And Iâm safe now
Underneath this oak tree
With you beside me

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And itâs not complete yet
Mustnât get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And Iâll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird

And of all these things
Iâm sure of
Iâm not quite certain
Of your love
And you made me scream
But then I made you cry
When I left that little bird
With its broken leg to die

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And itâs not complete yet
Mustnât get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
But Iâll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird whoa oh oh
My little bird
My little bird
Youâre my little bird
