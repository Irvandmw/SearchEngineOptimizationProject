Lyrics:


So this is Christmas
And what have you done?
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas
For weak and for strong
For rich and the poor ones
The war is so long
And so happy Christmas
War is over
For black and for white
If you want it
For yellow and red ones
War is over
Let's stop all the fight
Now

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas
And what have we done?
Another year over
And a new one just begun

And so happy Christmas
War is over
We hope you have fun
If you want it
The near and the dear ones
War is over
The old and the young
Now

A very merry Christmas
(A very merry Christmas)
And a happy New Year
Ooh, oh
Let's hope it's a good one
(It's a good, it's a good one)
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas
War is over
And what have we done?
If you want it
Another year over
War is over
And a new one just begun
Now
