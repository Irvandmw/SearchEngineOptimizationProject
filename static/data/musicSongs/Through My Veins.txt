Artist: Richard Marx Lyrics
Song Name: Through My Veins
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I saw you sitting by the window
Of a cafe I passed by
And though clearly my reflection
It was your face I recognised

And after all these years I'm still right here
Where you left me

And I've been calling out
Believing you would answer
But I'll try to let go now
Cause it's you running through
My veins

You'd come by when I was dreaming
But lately you've been gone
Maybe I've been trying too hard
And maybe you have just moved on

I guess there's not a lot that you forgot
To tell me

And I've missed you hanging round
And the way we were together
But I can't let go now
Cause it's you running through
My veins

Oh
It's you running through my veins
Oh
And it's you running through my veins
Oh
It's you running through my veins
