Lyrics:


I've been thinking about you
More than I want to
Spinning me around in this web
Getting in my heart and my head
Hanging on every word
Pretending they don't hurt
Wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time I hear you speak
But you do
Yes, you do

I wasn't looking for love, I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)
Tell me, who let you in
Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)

Can't fight this feeling
My heart's too revealing
Even though it's making me a fool
Can't tell love when it's tried or it's true
You're the one pulling me close
You're the one that I need the most
I wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time you're next to me
But you do
Yes, you do

I wasn't looking for love, I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)
Tell me, who let you in
Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)
Ohh
Ohh how did you get here?
How did you? How did you?

How did you scale the walls to my heart?
How did you know where to start?
How did you get here?
How did you get here?

How did you scale the walls to my heart?
How did you know where to start?
How did you get here?
How did you, how did you?

I wasn't looking for love, I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you get)
Tell me, who let you in
Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)
Ohh
Ohh how did you get here?
How did you? How did you?
Ohh
Ohh how did you get here?
How did you? How did you?
