Lyrics:


[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I never thought that you and I would ever meet again
I mourn the loss of you sometimes and pray for peace within
The word "distraught" cannot describe how my heart has been
But where do we begin now that you're back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you're back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you're back from the dead?

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
I held the funeral the day you left
A black umbrella and a sad song in my head
Buried your pictures that I loved the most
âCause if you survived me I just didn't wanna know
So you can't just come back now like a demon uninvited
No you can't just expect me to open my door to you because

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I never thought that you and I would ever meet again
I mourn the loss of you sometimes and pray for peace within
The word "distraught" cannot describe how my heart has been
But where do we begin now that you're back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you're back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you're back from the dead?

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
I'm so confused I don't know what to feel
Should I throw my arms around you or kill you for real?
âCause I worked so hard to put the past to rest
Now it's tumbling down on me just like an avalanche
So you can't just come back now like a demon uninvited
No you can't just expect me to open my door to you because

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I know I know I can sit and talk but I can't make you listen
You wish that I paid attention, I thought if I paid admissions
To wherever, go however, it would paint the perfect picture
You said "no matter how much you fucking make it doesn't make a difference"
And I'm so so so sorry that we fell in love, Geronimo, it's Like One thing leads to another

Swear we're fucking with dominos but, here we are
Now I'm trying to find an answer in this Bottle girl
And I'm I'm drowning slow, drowning slow, don't let the piranha's know

But you gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why we gotta wait that long?
Baby do-do-do-do-don't
Or should I walk out instead
Is this live and let die or night of the living dead?

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I never thought that you and I would ever meet again
I mourn the loss of you sometimes and pray for peace within
The word "distraught" cannot describe how my heart has been
But where do we begin now that you're back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you're back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you're back from the dead?
