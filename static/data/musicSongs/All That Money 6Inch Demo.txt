Lyrics:


[The Weeknd:]
Six inch heels, She walked in the club like nobody's business (nobody's business)
Goddamn, She murdered everybody and I was her witness
She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
But she worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
(Juno!)
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals (You know!)
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy
Then she kill the fucking stage like an enemy

Six inch heels, She walked in the club like nobody's business (nobody's business)
Goddamn, (Goddamn!)
She murdered everybody and I was her witness
She work for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, she work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

She trickin' on herself, she don't need a boss
(That Juno!)
It really ain't a thing to flaunt (That Two Door!)
Stuntin' with the ceilings off
Got these bitches in their feelings
Cause she played it off
Used to have a man, Wasn't meant to be (meant to be)
Made 100 bands that's a Century (century)
Saving up for plans that would never be
She already made enough but she'll never leave

All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (ouh yeah)
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (ouh yeah)
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (oh yeah)
F-Fallin' from the sky
F-F-Fallin' from the sky
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (from the sky)
All that money, money
Fallin' from the sky (skyyy)
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (sky)
F-Fallin' from the sky (sky)
Fallin' from the sky

[Belly:]
Got 100 bands I don't need a reason (I don't need a reason)
Tell these bitches it's killer season (It's killer season)
200 cash she don't need a Visa (She don't need a Visa)
Money money ah she ain't believe it
300 flat bitch act a freezer
Ballin' ballin' you played the bleachers
400 down, Crib on the beach
Comin' round and they gang gone flee

[The Weeknd:]
Six inch heels, She walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, She murdered everybody and I was her witness
She work for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, worth every dollar
But she worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she worth every minute, She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she worth every minute
