Lyrics:


Sposin' I should fall in love with you, 
Do you think that you could love me too? 
Sposin' I should hold you and caress you, 
Would it impress you, or distress you? 

Sposin' I should say "For you I yearn," 
Would you think I'm speakin' out of turn? 
An' sposin' I would declare it, 
Would you take my love and share it? 

I'm not sposin', 
I'm in love with you! 

[instrumental break]

Huh! Sposin' I should say "For you I yearn," 
Would you think I'm speakin' out of turn? 
An' sposin' I'd declare it, 
Would you take my love and share it? 

I'm not sposin', 
I'm in love with you!
