Lyrics:


Now, the night is coming to an end,
Oh

The sun will rise, and we will try again.
Oh

Stay alive, stay alive, for me.
You will die, but now your life is free,

Take
Pride
In what is sure
To
Die.

I will fear the night again,
Oh

I hope I'm not my only friend.
Oh

Stay alive, stay alive, for me.
You will die, but now your life is free,

Take
Pride
In what is sure
To
Die.
