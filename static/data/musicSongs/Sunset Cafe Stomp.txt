Lyrics:


Sunset stomp got folks jumpinâ
Sunset stomp got folks
Jumpin' up and down, all around
They yell, band men play some more

Charleston, Charleston
Iâll say it's hot
But your black bottom, itâs got âem
But, oh, that sunset stomp

Lord, itâs going
And the people strain
Created in the crazy house
It sets good folks insane

Gentlemen, ladies too
Push 'em round n round
They loose their head
Theyâll drop dead

Doinâ that sunset stomp
I said, doin' sunset stomp
