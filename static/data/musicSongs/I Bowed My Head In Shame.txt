Song Name: I Bowed My Head In Shame
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


When I sat down to count my many blessings
And I saw what the Lord had done for me
Then I bowed my head in shame
Because I know so well
That I haven't been as good as I could be

I saw a beggar standin' on the corner
And he looked like a cold and hungry man
With some money in my pocket
I kept walkin' on
And I passed him by when he held out his hand

When I think of all the things that I've done wrong
I have to sit and bow my head in shame
For the Lord has been so good
As he promised us he would
So I wanna praise and glorify his name

I'm gonna try to do my best to thank him
And I'll try to be as good as I can be
Though I bow my head in shame
I wanna praise his name
For the many things the Lord has done for me

When I think of all the things that I've done wrong
I have to sit and bow my head in shame
For the Lord has been so good
As he promised us he would
So I wanna praise and glorify his name

Yes, I'm gonna try and do my best, best to thank him
And I'll try to be as good as I can be
Yeah, though I bow my head in shame
I wanna praise, praise his name
For the many things the Lord has done for me
Aw, for the many things the Lord has done for me
Yes, for the many things the Lord has done for me
