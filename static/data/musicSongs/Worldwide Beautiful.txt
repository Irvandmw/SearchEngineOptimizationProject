Lyrics:


White churches, black churches
Different people, same hearses
It's kinda hard to fight with each other
Laying down in the ground, six under
At every show I see my people
They ain't the same but they're all equal
One love, one God, one family

You're missing every color
If you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind
If your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other
From one to another, I look around
And see worldwide beautiful

Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God
Coast to coast, city to city
Reach out your hands if you're with me
Still got some work but we still got a dream
Every shade, every heart come together and sing
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God

You're missing every color
If you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind
If your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other
From one to another, I look around
And see worldwide beautiful

One love, one God, one family (One family, y'all, c'mon)
One love, one God, one family (Worldwide beautiful)
One love, one God, one family (Worldwide beautiful)
One Love, one God, one family (Sing it with me)

You're missing every color
If you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind
If your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other
From one to another, I look around
And see worldwide beautiful
Look around and see worldwide beautiful, so beautiful
Look around and see worldwide beautiful
(Worldwide beautiful)
(Worldwide beautiful)
Look around and see worldwide beautiful
