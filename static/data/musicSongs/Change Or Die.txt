Lyrics:


LET'S GO!
This is a battle call
To one to all
The opposition
Who will take the fall

Are you sick of just getting by?
Are you tired of the fucking crying?
Are you looking for a better life?

Change or die
We're looking for the answers of our lives
Tonight
You gotta change or die
The answer is for you to do what's right
Tonight

Are you corrupted
By the status quo?
The repetition
Is kills us all
Is the rat race dragging you down
Are you stuck in that dead end town?
Are you looking for the way out?

Change or die
We're looking for the answers of our lives tonight
You gotta change or die
The answer is for you to do what's right
Tonight

YEAHH!
We won't go down
Not tonight
This is our battle cry
We're ready to fight
We won't go down
Not tonight
This is our battle cry we're ready to fight

Change or die
we're looking for the answers of our lives
Tonight
You gotta change or die
The answer is for you to do what's right
Tonight

CHANGE OR DIE!
CHANGE OR DIE!
