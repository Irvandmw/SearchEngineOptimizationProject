Lyrics:


When I wanted you, you would not reciprocate
When I needed you, you would always show up late
But things have changed, and I've got the upper hand
You can run and I've got you eating out of my hand

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Get to work and give me money
That's more like it!
That's more like it!
(That's more like it, that's more like it)

When my birthday came, you would not remember it
When I got my period, you were inconsiderate
But tables turn, and it's great to be on top
Got you great to appreciate the good that you've got

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
It's great to be the last one laughing
That's more like it!
That's more like it!
(That's more like it, that's more like it)

I like chocolate
And I like daisies
Maybe you better write this down
I love cashmere, and I want diamonds
Ready for my massage right now...

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, it's about time
You get to work and give me money
That's more like it!
That's more like it!
(That's more like it, that's more like it)
