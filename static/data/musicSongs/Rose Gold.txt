Lyrics:


And you know my ice drip nig'
Rose gold, from my lip nig'
Last show, a lil trip nig'
I froze out my neck and my wrist

Countin' bankrolls, all whites in this Range Rove
Baby on my dick, she said it's hard to keep her legs closed
I was dead broke, kickin' doors to get this peso
Broman, catchin' cases, duckin' ops, we had to lay low
Roll runnin' shit, while we flooded out the faygo
Hoes on my dick, I'mma beat it if you say so
That's why she mad, cause I can't stay faithful
All she ever wanted was the mo'fuckin' bankroll
Since I blew up, ice drip, water bust down
When I was a youngin', man I flipped bout a whole pound
Fold to the neck, po' it up, make you slow down
When I'm in yo' city, bet I'll pull up, shut your shit down

And you know my ice drip nig'
Rose gold, see the tint from my lip nig'
Last show, had to make a lil trip nig'
I froze out my neck and my wrist nig'
Aye, and you know my ice drip nig'
Rose gold, see the tint from my lip nig'
Last show, had to make a lil trip nig'
I froze out my neck and my wrist nig'

Took your last bitch
She had me right yeah
But only linked up for the night yeah
She blowin' up my phone, I had to block that shit
Cause you bitch you a hoe, better stop that shit
I was dead broke on some stank shit
Tote the pole, hit a lick, we on the same shit
I know you niggas on that fake shit
I know these bitches on the same shit
Swervin' with my nigga, yeah we ridin'
And my reckless G's, yeah they slidin'
Fuck being broke, I got to grindin'
And I can't slow down, cause now I'm shinin'

And you know my ice drip nig'
Rose gold, see the tint from my lip nig'
Last show, had to make a lil trip nig'
I froze out my neck and my wrist nig'
Aye, and you know my ice drip nig'
Rose gold, see the tint from my lip nig'
Last show, had to make a lil trip nig'
I froze out my neck and my wrist nig'
