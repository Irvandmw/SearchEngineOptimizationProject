Lyrics:


(Rudolph Rudolph)
Rudolph the red nose reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the red nose reindeer
You'll go down in history

(Rudolph the red nose reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games)

Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph mit your nose so bright
Won't you guide mein sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the red beaked reindeer
You'll go down in history
