Lyrics:


Yeah! Uhuh...

Ye ye cool story but your vibe you bore me
And I be like "true!"
Do you boo-boo
Nobody gonna stop ya
Talking all that shit who'd want ya
Well your bitch friends ain't real partners
So I dip like a nickname salsa
And your bitch uptight like braids is
Need a fix so I call my barber
UUU bitch read my posture!
And I weed like I'm on that rasta
That shit out but you're gonna need armour
Where the fuck is my daughters and my boobies and my markers
My food game is too proper
Cause your bitch can't afford three lockers
Just get up and get obnoxious
Doing soo-soos in the whip
New dude, up crew, new hits ya
Doing soo-soos in the whip
New dude, up crew, new hits ya
You can't change my flaws, too sharp like a samurai sword
(Shiing!)
Revolutionary adour
Can't bite with the cat on board
Yo' feeling good feeling great, feeling great feeling good how are you [x4]

Yeah! Uhuh...
Ye ye cool story but your vibe you bore me...
