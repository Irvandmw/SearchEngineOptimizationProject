Lyrics:


Shoowap Shoowah
Shoowap Shadoobee Doobee
[x2]

Today I told you
I would be gone
Before the night time
I'd be all alone
But I never got a call
Did you wonder at all
Where I was goin'
When I was leaving
Did you even care
Now I'm pulling out my hair
And I'm singing to myself

Shoowap Shoowah
Shoowap Shadoobee Doobee
[x2]

I feel them raindrops
Pouring on my head
And now I'm thinking
About everything I said
No you never heard a line
What a stupid waste of precious time
I wished the rain'd stop
I wished my bus would come
And I'll be goin'
Before I see the Sun
It's a new start
A new life for me
Now I'm happy finally
So sing

Shoowap Shoowah
Shoowap Shadoobee Doobee
[x2]

(Shoowap Shoowah...)
I'm finally gone
(I can sing this song)
I'm not going back
(I'm all done with that)
I'm finally free
And I-I say shoowap

Shoowap Shoowah
Shoowap Shadoobee Doobee
[x2]

Well the times have changed
I'm feeling pretty good
I bet you think
I am all misunderstood
But haven't lost my ways
In fact I met someone today and
Oh!
(Shoowap Shoowah...)
I'm finally gone
(I can sing this song)
I'm not going back
(I'm all done with that)
I'm finally free
Now I can say shoowap

(Shoowap Shoowah...)
Shadobee Doobee Doo
I'm finally free
So I can sing
Shoowah shabadobadeebada...
I'm finally free
