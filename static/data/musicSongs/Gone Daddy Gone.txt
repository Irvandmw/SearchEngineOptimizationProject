Lyrics:


Beautiful girl, lovely dress,
High school smiles, oh yes,
Beautiful girl, lovely dress,
Where she is now I can only guess.

[Chorus:]
'cause it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
Yeah, it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
'cause it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
'cause it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone away.

When I see you,
Eyes will turn blue,
When I see you,
A thousand eyes turning blue.

[Chorus]

I can tell by the way
That you baby talk
I can see by the way,
That you baby talk.
I know by the way that you,
Treat your man.
I can love you baby, 'til it's a crime.

[Chorus]

Beautiful girl, lovely dress,
15 smiles, oh yes,
Beautiful girl, lovely dress,
Where she is now I can only guess.

[Chorus]
