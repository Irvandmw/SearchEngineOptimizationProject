["BP"]

You are crazy

Somewhere in the sky, got a clear view
Everything Supreme, that we do (Oh)
Everything is Gucci that you do
So everything Supreme and BP
Everything Supreme and BP, oh
Oh, oh, oh, BP

Sunshine vibe, chillin' in the Summer (In the Summer)
Speedboat out, and the Lamb' down under (Down under)
We gon' ride, through the rain, through the thunder (Yeah)
You see what it is with them ladies, all wonder
Go put it all on the table 'cause you know I'm, I'ma lick it, ooh wee, yeah, yeah
I know you ready and capable, so why don't we try?

Girl just admit you got that glow
Walkin', modellin' for me, back and forth, uh
Wanna show you off, I'm telling everyone I know
Yeah, that's my baby and I know that my bitch cold
Sorry, you gorgeous, you're beautiful
And these designer clothes

Balenciaga, got it for you (Oh, oh)
Somewhere in the sky, got a clear view (Oh, yeah, yeah)

Girl, you woo me in them Jimmy Choos
And to be specific, you like them Christian Loubs
Let me check you, Bottega, your whole value
I don't want no one else around you
But all my suits, CC my tailor
Get your hair, your nails, your feet and makeup
You in my dreams, I see you when I wake up
Baby, I don't have to fake it, know you the flyest
I can't deny it

Girl just admit you got that glow (You got that glow)
Walkin', modellin' for me, back and forth, uh (Ooh)
Wanna show you off, I'm telling everyone I know

Sorry, you gorgeous, you're beautiful
And these designer clothes

["No Judgement"]

I won't judge you for what you do tonight, ooh

'Cause baby you be on mind when we not together (Hey, hey)
Baby tell me if the vibe is right? (Right)
You know that I can cosign tonight, hey
First place spendin' it on you (On you)
Throw that ass up, Alley-oop (Alley-oop)
I'm undefeated with that pussy, cannot lose, uh
Just spin around on me like hula hoop (Hula hoop), yeah

Jump into the vibe, don't be actin' insecure
I'm tryna get it soon as you hit the door
Interception with the pass, got that ass I'm tryna score
You the cheerleader, pom-pom to the floor I-

I brought my rodeo, no baby don't need no saddle
You know I'm up so giddy up, and you know we don't give a fuck
No matter where we go, we own the city, run for mayor
Easy, Breezy, baby this a lay up, lay up
Hit it really wrong if you love somebody (Somebody)
Even though you love somebody else ('Body else)
Can you really love somebody? (Somebody)
Thinkin' I should be in love with my fuckin' self

Jump into the vibe, don't be actin' insecure
I'm tryna get it soon as you hit the door
Interception with the pass, got that ass I'm tryna score
You the cheerleader, pom-pom to the floor I-

I won't judge you for what you do tonight, ooh

I'm tryna share but you slide, hell yeah
Pass it to the right, you decide, hell yeah

Pass it to the right, you decide, hell yeah
