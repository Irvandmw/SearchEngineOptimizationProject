Lyrics:


I always say the first thing, not the right thing
I'm better at a last call than a phone call
I'd rather lean hard on the gas and forget about the brake
I try to laugh the truth off instead of face it
I come undone without a warning
Every time I move on I leave damage in my wake

I'm not what you were looking for
Thought I was hello and nothing more

All you wanted was something that's real, a story to tell
A drink maybe two, top of the shelf
A stare in a cab on the way to some band
A curbside closing time kiss
You needed the right head to turn, the right hand to touch
A feeling to chase, a fall you could trust
Somewhere to run, someone to miss
But somehow you ended up with someone to fix, oh oh oh

Did you get caught up in the moment
Drop your guard for just a minute
How'd you get tangled all up in the careless wreck I am
Broken hearts leave hearts broken
Loving me is so hard I know it
Why you took me on, I'll never understand

You were looking for something that's real, a story to tell
A drink maybe two, top of the shelf
A stare in a cab on the way to some band
A curbside closing time kiss
You needed the right head to turn, the right hand to touch
A feeling to chase, a fall you could trust
Somewhere to run, someone to miss
But somehow you ended up with someone to fix, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
You were looking for something that's real, a story to tell
A drink maybe two, top of the shelf
A stare in a cab on the way to some band
A curbside closing time kiss
You needed the right head to turn, the right hand to touch
A feeling to chase, a fall you could trust
Somewhere to run, someone to miss
But somehow you ended up with someone to fix, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
