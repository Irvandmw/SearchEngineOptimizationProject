Lyrics:


My Lord, I have read this book so many times
But nowhere can, can I find the page that says what I experienced today has any grace

Now I know that life is meant to be hard
That's how I learned to appreciate my God
Though my courage may be tried
I can tell you I won't hide
Because the footprints show you were by my side

You can lie to a child with a smiling face
Tell me that color ain't about a race
You can cast the first stone
You can break my bones
But you never gonna break
You never gonna break my faith
Faith and hope ain't yours to give
Truth and liberty are mine to live
Steal a crown from a king, break an angel's wings
But you never gonna break
You never gonna break my faith

My Lord, won't you help them, help them, help them to understand
That when someone takes the life of an innocent man
Well they never really won
Because all they really done is set the soul free
Where it's supposed to be

You can lie to a child with a smiling face
Tell me that color ain't about a race
You can cast the first stone, you can break my bones
But you never gonna break
You never gonna break my faith
Faith and hope ain't yours to give
Truth and liberty are mine to live
Steal a crown from a king, break an angel's wings
But you never gonna break
You never gonna break my faith

For those we lose before their time
I pray their souls will find a light
I know that the day will surely come, when it will be done
You never gonna break my faith
You never gonna break my faith
