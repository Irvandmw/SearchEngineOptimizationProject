Lyrics:


Well I thought Iâd seen it all
From beginning to the end
Yeah I was the great pretender
Always alone again

Well a light came shining in
When you took my breath away
Now I know Iâve waited all my life
To do what I feel today

So tell me Iâm dreaming
(Oh woah)
Coz I canât hold back these tears I cry
And you never looked more beautiful tonight
(Oh woah)
So if Iâm dreaming
(Oh woah)
Donât wake me up Iâm so alive
Wish you could see what I see
Through these eyes of mine

Now weâre standing face to face
I can hear the words weâre saying
This is now and will be forever
In this moment we could stay

So tell me Iâm dreaming
(Oh woah)
Coz I canât hold back these tears I cry
And you never looked more beautiful tonight
(Oh woah)
So if Iâm dreaming
(Oh woah)

Donât wake me up Iâm so alive
Wish you could see what I see
Through these eyes of mine

Woah woah oh

So donât wake me up
Donât let me down
My heart beats for love
And love lifts me higher
Right into the clouds
Iâm flying so high
With tears in my eyes
And I have never, ever felt this alive

So tell me Iâm dreaming
(Oh woah)
Coz I canât hold back these tears I cry
And you never looked more beautiful tonight
(Oh woah)
So if Iâm dreaming
(Oh woah)
Donât wake me up Iâm so alive
Wish you could see what I see
Through these eyes of mine

So donât wake me up
Donât let me down
My heart beats for love
And love lifts me higher
Right into the clouds
Iâm flying so high
With tears in my eyes
And I have never, ever felt so alive
