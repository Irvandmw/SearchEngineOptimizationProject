Lyrics:


And I'm just giving you real...
I swear these niggas be so temporary
Bitches be so temporary
I'm just just giving you the real
Gotta listen I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Lemme tell you how I feel

I heard loyalty is everything & shit
But where she at I swear to god
I never seen that bitch
They said they love me I promise
I won't believe that shit
Cause they be faking it
Saying it like they mean that shit
I hate that, why you want the truth
If you can't face that
I be keeping that shit a thousand
I give em straight facts
Time is money, money is time
& you can't replace that
If everything I tell you is real & how you gon fake that
& I ain't saying niggas is
Different
But yeah it's different
& a lot of niggas say they official
Really be bitches
Just keep a small circle if not
Just stay independent cause is  quick
To switch up & go missing
And they will never go that hard with you
Never go that far with you
How you gon let a nigga eat
& he ain't starve with you
Prolly take break the law with you
Never take the charge with you
Watch you slip up
They will never take the fall with you

Temporary, bitches be so temporary
I'm just givin you the real gotta listen
I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think
They hear me, lemme tell you how I feel
Swear these niggas be so temporary
Bitches be so temporary
I'm just givin you the real you gotta listen
I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Lemme tell you how I feel

So now I'm walking in the rain
With my timbs on stepping over
Puddles full of pain
All my friends gone, some in jail
Other niggas changed like a drake song
I just feel like nothing was the same
But I'm going & I'm scoring
I'm just making that shit count
When I have these niggas chances
They kept turning that shit down
Yeah they say they fucking with me
They just say that shit right now
But when I turn around
They no where to be found
& I ain't with the drama
(I ain't with drama)
I know these bitches temporary
When I see em I say hamba
I don't need em I say hamba
I say asalamalakum
They gon tell me walaikum sala [x2]
It's the same with these niggas
That be saying they gon ride or die
When I know
They ain't really gon ride or die
I fuck around & let that choppa fly

Temporary, bitches be to temporary
I'm just givin you the real gotta listen
I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think
They hear me, lemme tell you how I feel
Swear these niggas be so temporary
Bitches be so temporary
I'm just givin you the real you gotta listen
I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Lemme tell you how I feel

Just because they day1
That don't make em a1
Real recognize real nigga
I can't mistake one
I just keep it pushing when I run into
A fake one
I know loyalty is everything
Until my fucking day come
Ain't it crazy how them niggas say they
Fucking with ya, grab a pistol
Bust it with ya, you go to work
They at ya crib tryna fuck ya sister
The ones close to you
Will do the most you
If it's bread on ya head I'll bet
They put that toaster to you
They look at you & smile tho go half
With you on a bottle
Sip Hennessy & Moscato I ain't even
Gon lie tho, that's word to my nigga
Quado, rest in peace my nigga quado
They call you bro when they need you
In the cold like Chicago
First they love then they hate you
Then they turn into a snake again
No new niggas I'll never
Make that mistake again
They start off real cool
But once you see that they faking it
Take a picture nigga you might never
See they face again

Temporary, bitches be to temporary
I'm just givin you the real gotta listen
I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think
They hear me, lemme tell you how I feel
Swear these niggas be so temporary
Bitches be so temporary
I'm just givin you the real you gotta listen
I don't think they hear me
Turn it up cause I don't think they hear me
Lemme tell you I feel

Lemme tell you how I feel yeah
(Lemme tell you how I feel yeah)
& I'm just giving you the real
(& I'm just giving you real)
