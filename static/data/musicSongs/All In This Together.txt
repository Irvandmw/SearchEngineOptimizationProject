Lyrics:


Let me tell you what I see through my eyes 
Apathy is all around and on the rise 
We channel so much energy through our greed 
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need 
Lemme tell you 

Money canât buy lives 
Sunny days for you 
Living is more than profits accrued 
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together 

It's funny how we took a prayer out of schools 
After the 9-11 scare thatâs all we do 
We compromise our liberties for security 
We can become so self in dosed that we canât see 
Lemme tell you 

Money canât buy lives 
Sunny days for you 
Living is more than profits accrued 
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together 

Donât throw in the towel 
Letâs overcome the test for now 
Together (together) we last, divided we fall 
Love will conquer all 

Money canât buy lives 
Sunny days for you (Sunny days for you)
Living is more than profits accrued
(We gotta change, we gotta change right now)
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together 

Money canât buy lives 
Sunny days for you 
Living is more than profits accrued 
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together
