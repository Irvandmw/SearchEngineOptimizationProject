Song Name: Born In A Prison
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


We are born in a prision,
raised in a prision
Send to a prision called school,

We cry in a prision,
We love in a prision,
We live in a prision,
like fools.

Wood becomes a flut when
it's loved,
reach for your self and your
battered mates.
Mirror becomes a razor when
it's broken,
Look in a mirror and see
your shattered fate.

We live with no reason,
Kicked around for no reason,
Thrown out without reason
like tools.

Work in a prision
And hate in aprision
And die in a prision
as a rule.

We live in a prision
Among judges and wardnes
And wait for no reason or use
We laugh in a prision,
Go through all four seasons
And die with no vision
or truth
