[Spoken introduction:]
Yes, all I could say is yes
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill
Promise me when they all love you that you'll remember me
When you fuck them you'll see my face.
My body is yoursâ¦
Every Thursday

It seems like pain and regret are your best friends
'Cause everything you do leads to them, right, right, right,
But, baby, I could be your best friend
Baby, I could fuck you right

Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, oh yeah

Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, oh yeah

You're blaming all your sins on your best friends
And nothing's ever ever your fault
Nothing's your fault, baby, no
Baby, you don't need your best friends
'Cause I got everything you want

Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, oh yeah

Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, oh yeah

Yes, all I could say is yes
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill
Promise me when they all love you that you'll remember me
When you fuck them you'll see my face
My body is yours
Give them any other day but Thursday
You belong to me every Thursday
I wait for you
I'll be beautiful for you
Every Thursday
I exist only on Thursday

Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday

I love the guitars
