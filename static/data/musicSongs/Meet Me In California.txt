Lyrics:


I knew that this was wrong as I
Stood reaching for the bedroom light
But she turned me on
So I turned it off
Every man has got his flaws
His breaking point, his sacred cause
And I had mine
But I crossed that line
Now I could never ask you to
Forgive me for the things I do
But if you ever need me
You know where I'll be
Meet me in California
I'll be there waiting for your call
I'll be there waiting for you
'cause you know in California
There's something better for us all
Meet me in California
This night was like a bible verse
With pages torn and missing words
Condemning me
And I'm on my knees
I wish that I could start again
Peel the past like sunburned skin
Right off of me
But it's not that easy
I don't wanna say goodbye
And I don't wanna make you cry
I just wanna see you smile again
'cause everything I used to be
Is waiting over there for me
This is a beginning not an end
