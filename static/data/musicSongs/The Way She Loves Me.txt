Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I'll have this feeling
Till the day that I die
When I hear my baby calling
A simple motion, a look in her eyes
And I'm helplessly falling
I'd give all of somebody else
For any piece of her heart that's left
She knows me better than I know myself

[Chorus:]
Let me tell you
'bout the way she loves me
Ooh, I'm proud to let it show
I'm crazy about the way she loves me
Ooh, I want the world to know
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Came close to letting this train pass me by
Just like a fool, second guessing
I could've spent my life wondering why
I didn't cherish the blessing
But I know, she'd come my way
Lonely nights would have been okay
I have her promise that she's gonna stay

[Chorus]

Nobody else could do me so right
A breath of Heaven in my darkest night
I'm gonna hold on with all of my might

[Chorus]
