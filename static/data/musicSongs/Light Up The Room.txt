Lyrics:


Another late night looking at her
All her exes never mattered
She don't break hearts, they get shattered
They get shattered

People talking, chitter chatter
She calls shotgun, people scatter
She go bang bang till it splatters
Till it splatters

She got me losing touch, she got me losing faith
Making the same excuses for the same mistakes
Before it all goes dark, before I fade away
I wanna turn you on, watch you illuminate

When you walk in you light up the room
Light up the room, light up the room
When you walk in you light up the room
Light up the room and I see nothing but you
I see nothing but you
I see nothing but...

All that glitz and all that glamour
Wearing rings like she was Saturn
That's that sci-fi shit I'm after
Shit I'm after

She got me losing touch, she got me losing faith
Making the same excuses for the same mistakes
Before it all goes dark, before I fade away
I wanna turn you on, watch you illuminate

When you walk in you light up the room
Light up the room, light up the room
When you walk in you light up the room
Light up the room and I see nothing but you
I see nothing but you
I see nothing but...

You throw game like daggers I'm aware
Leave behind cadavers everywhere
I'm full of dark matter, best beware
Leave the morning after, don't you dare

When you walk in you light up the room
Light up the room, light up the room
When you walk in you light up the room
Light up the room and I see nothing but you
Light up the room, I see nothing but you
Light up the room, light up the room, I see nothing but you
