Lyrics:


The high and mighty, they have fallen
On a road to hell, paved with good intentions
When you are all alone, with the voices calling
Telling you all the things too dark to mention

I know the right way
I know the right road to take
I may get lost on my way
But I'll get back on the right road today

The high and mighty, they have fallen
On a road to hell, paved with good intentions
When I am all alone and the devil's calling
Whispering the things too dark to mention

I know the right way
I know the right road to take
I may get lost on my way
But I'll get back on the right road today

Get up off the ground
Get up, keep on moving up
Get up, get up off the ground
Get up, strap your boots on now

(Get up)
I know the right way (get up)
I know the right road to take (get up)
I may get lost on my way (get up)
But I'll get back on the right road today (get up)
I know the right way (get up)
I know the right road to take (get up)
I may get lost on my way (get up)
But I'll get back on the right road today
