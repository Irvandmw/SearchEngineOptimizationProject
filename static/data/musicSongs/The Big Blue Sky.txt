Lyrics:


Gonna fly fly away over the mountain
Gonna fly fly away over the sea
Gonna keep flying around and never never come down
'Cause the big blue sky is the place for me

Got a gal out in Wyoming and a gal in Tennessee
One thing they got in common they want no part of me
Oh a girl here on earth is more trouble than she's worth
So I'll leave them all behind yesiree

(Gonna fly fly away over the mountain) (DM) Mountain
(Both) Gonna fly fly away over the sea
(Both) Gonna keep flying around and never never come down
(Both) 'Cause the big blue sky is the place for me

You will find me playing leap frog with the man up in the moon
Have myself a time each evening sleep each day 'til noon
And the bluebirds I'll bet let sing in their quartet
And we'll harmonize a barbershop too

(Both) Gonna fly fly away over the mountain
(Both) Gonna fly fly away over the sea
(Both) Gonna keep flying around and never never come down
(Both) 'Cause the big blue sky is the place for me

Gonna hobknob with the angels who would want a better crowd
Gonna dance all over heaven and boy will I be proud
Gonna play peek-a-boo with the stars up in the blue
And when I get tired I'll rest on a cloud

Gonna fly fly away over the mountain
Gonna fly fly away over the sea
Gonna keep flying around and never never come down
'Cause the big blue sky is the place I want to be
Gonna fly away over the sea
Yes the big blue sky is the place for me
