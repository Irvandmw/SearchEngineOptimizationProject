Song Name: I Can't Spell
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I found the words to say how I feel
But I just canât spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That Iâm a different man with a different tune
I didnât find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
âCos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something close
