Lyrics:


Uh, yeah

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in hereâs not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoiaâs all I got left
I donât know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Itâs like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
And watches everything
So, know that when itâs time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back
Itâs like a whirlwind inside of my head
Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin

Hey, yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isnât real
But in my mind, I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds
Hundred degrees
My soul bleeds, devil mustâve planted the seed
Now it feels like my backâs against the wall
Iâm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobodyâs responding at all
But I donât know who I can trust
The screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the frame
All Iâm trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blast-to-beat
But something keeps talking to me
Consciously, responsibly, keeps haunting me from dusk âtil dawn
Everything has something for you
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face
Exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off your skin Iâd probably find another person
Thereâs nothing worse than trying to bring yourself on back from the dead
So I advise you: listen to that voice in the back of your head 

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back
Itâs like a whirlwind inside of my head
Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back
Itâs like a whirlwind inside of my head
Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
Itâs like Iâm paranoid
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
Canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back
Itâs like a whirlwind inside of my head
Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back
Itâs like a whirlwind inside of my head
Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin
