Lyrics:


[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Just one night, two night
It could be three of us
Yeh yeh yeh
Girl, we could get it ooon
Where yaâ girlfriend
Girl, we can have a ball
Bring yaâ girlfriend
Lifeâs too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if weâre promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
Weâll have the rest of our time to celebrate

[Verse: 50 Cent]
Four in the morning girl
Now I donât wanna talk, weâve been talkin for hours
Now you know I wannaâ fuck
Look I donât understand what it
Is you donât understand
My watch a hundred grand
My chain a hundred grand
Bitch, Iâm a wanted man
I say I run New York
Cuz I do what the fuck I wanna do
They know wussup
They say my screws are lose
I say who cares, you know Iâm rich
Look I donât have time to blow witâ a bitch shootin the shit
Now maybe you can loosen up and let me go to work
So I can whisper in your ear while pullinâ down your skirt
When I get the strokinâ girl you donât know what to say
Quicky come quick, girl, Iâm gone right away, yeh, you nasty, girl, you nasty
And Iâm into that, so get at me!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I donât want no good, good, good, good, girl
Me, I want a nasty girl
Come creep witâ me
Be a freak for me
Lifeâs too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if weâre promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
Weâll have the rest of our time to celebrate

[Verse: Too Short]
I said beetch
I wanna fuck you in the worst way
Hell yeah, I wanna fuck you on the first date
If I donât I say, fuck you on Thursday
Cuz then I wonât want you
Watch how fast I dump you
But right now Iâm infatuated
You get to hang witâ me
Girl, you graduated
I take you out for drinks and get you tipsy
Then I pull my dick out and I say kiss me
Youâre âbout to laugh ya little panties off
You only get one date
You better grab these balls
They wannaâ ride in fancy cars
Thatâs what bitches do
They like to rub it then suck it and lick it too
Sheâs a nasty little trap ho slut
But I like that shit, so letâs fuck
Beeeeitch

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I donât want no good, good, good, good, girl
Me, I want a nasty girl
Come creep witâ me
Be a freak for me
Lifeâs too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if weâre promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
Weâll have the rest of our time to celebrate

[Outro]

[50 Cent]
Ohhh, ehhhh
It sounds crazy
But tomorrowâs not promised
I mean, I mean I wannaâ do it today
I want it now
I donât wannaâ wait
Wait for what?
My timeâs runninâ out
Your timeâs runninâ out
Come âer girl

[Too Short]
Wannaâ fuck you beeeitch
I wanna fuck you beeitch
You only got
One date
Ainât no tomorrows
