Lyrics:


Children, Broadripple is burning,
and the girls are getting sick
Of huffing glue up in the bathroom 
While your boyfriends pick up chicks, 
And darling I'm lost, 
I heard you whispering that night in the fountain square,
The trash filled streets
Made me wish that you were heading home. 

There was love inside the basement 
Where that woman use to lie 
In the sleeping bag we shared upon the floor almost every night
And darling I'm drunk, and everything you thought you had will turn to stone, 
So pack your bags, 
And come back home.

And I'm wasted 
You can taste it, 
Don't look at me that way.
Coz I'll be hanging from a rope 
And I will haunt you like a ghost. 

If my woman was a fire, 
She'd burn out before I wake 
And be replaced by pints of whiskey, 
Cigarettes and outer space 
If somebody moves, then everything you thought you had will go to shit,
We've got a lot, don't you dare forget that.

And I wrote this on an airplane,
Where the people look like eggs
N' when the woman that you love
Is gone, she was bombing east Japan
If somebody moves, and everything you thought you had will go to shit, 
We've got a lot don't you dare forget that. 

And I'm wasted, you can taste it,
Don't look at me that way
Coz I'll be hanging from a rope,
And I will haunt you like a ghost. 

And I'm wasted, you can taste it,
Don't look at me that way
Coz I'll be hanging from a rope, 
And I will haunt you like a ghost.
