Lyrics:


She the baddest in the club but she know (but she know)
She the baddest everywhere that she go (that she go)
You can think you gon' get it but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking goat

She look super good but she act super ba-a-ad
Diamonds on her neck, make them bitches ma-a-d
She gon' break your neck when she shake that a-ass
Drop it to the floor, bounce it, bounce it like, like that
I like that and you look like a whole snack
And I'm down to drop a whole track
'Cause you killin' me in that dress
Oh my God

Oh my, oh my God
How the fuck did I end up next to her in this club?
Oh my God, she got curves
And I bet she swear anybody tryna say words to her

She gon' light up every room that she walk in
When she in the bitch, everybody talkin'
You can think you gon' get it but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking goat
She the baddest in the club but she know (but she know)
She the baddest everywhere that she go (that she go)
You can think you gon' get it but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking goat

She da goat, she da goat, she da goat, she da goat
She da goat, she da goat, she da goat, she da goat

She's so dope, she should be in a fucking center fold
But she won't when she walk in the door, everyone frozen
Pussy taste like roses, part the seas like Moses
Good in every photo but that bitch ain't ever posin'
Yeah, that girl be poppin' and she got no plan of stoppin' it
She be steady flossin' in her walk in closet, oh my God
Oh my God

How the fuck did I end up next to her in this club?
Oh my God, she got curves
And I bet she swear anybody tryna say words to her

She gon' light up every room that she walk in
When she in the bitch, everybody talkin'
You can think you gon' get it but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking goat
She the baddest in the club but she know (but she know)
She the baddest everywhere that she go (that she go)
You can think you gon' get it but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking goat
