Lyrics:


In my loneliness... 
when you're gone and I'm all by myself, 
an' I need your caress,  
I just think of you, and the thought of you holding me near 
makes my loneliness soon disappear...  

Though you're far away,  
I have only to close my eyes and you are back to stay,  
I just close my eyes and the sadness missing you brings,  
soon is gong and this heart of mine sings 
yes, I love you so, and that for me is all I need to know... 

I will wait for you,  

'till the sun falls out of the sky, for what else can I do? 
I will wait for you,  
meditating how sweet life will be when you come back to me... 

[instrumental break]

I will wait for you, meditating how sweet life will be when you come back to me... 
Became these quiet nights of loving you! 

(I will wait for you...) Come back to me...
