Lyrics:


What will you do when you get lonely?
No one waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
Begging, darling please, Layla
Darling won't you ease my worried mind

Tried to give you consolation
Your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turn my whole world upside down

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
Begging, darling please, Layla
Darling won't you ease my worried mind

Make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say, we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
Begging, darling please, Layla
Darling won't you ease my worried mind

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
Begging, darling please, Layla
Darling won't you ease my worried mind

[Guitar solo]

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
Begging, darling please, Layla
Darling won't you ease my worried mind
