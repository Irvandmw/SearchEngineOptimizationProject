Lyrics:


I believe, I believe there's love in you
Grid locked on the dusty avenues
Inside your heart, just afraid to go
I am more, I am more than innocent
But just take a chance and let me in
And I'll show you ways that you don't know

Don't complicate it,
Don't let the past dictate
Yeah,
I have been patient, but slowly I'm losing faith

So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby

I believe, I believe you could love me
But you're lost on the road to misery
And what I gave to you
I could never get back!
Don't complicate it,
Don't drive yourself insane
Yeah,
Say what you will but I know that you want to stay!

So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby

Chemicals rushing in,
I know it's you that I belong to
I'm burning like a cannonball in the air
Crashing into who I belong to
Uh uh, uuuuh uuuuh uh

I have been patient, but slowly I'm losing faith

Please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby

So please, I know you baby
(The shadows of your heart are hanging in the sweet, sweet air)
I know you baby
(I know you baby)
So please, I know you baby
(The secrets that you hide, control us and it's just not fair)
I know you baby

The shadows of your heart are hanging in the sweet, sweet air
I know you baby
The secrets that you hide, control us and it's just not fair
I know you baby
