Lyrics:


You are my love and my life
And you are my inspiration
Just you 'n me
Simple and free
Baby, you're everything I've ever dreamed of
Yeah, yeah

Give me your own special smile
Promise you'll never leave me
Just you 'n me
Simple and free
Life is so easy
When you're beside me
Oh girl

Come, hold me close
Never release me
(Oh baby don't release me)
Open your arms, let my love in
(Let me in, let me in, let me in)
Love me tonight
love me forever and ever
(You know I can't forget you)

Just you 'n me to carry on
Simple and free, my lovely
To flow as one as love's reward
Lovin' you, girl is so damn easy
Yeah, yeah

You are my love in my life
You are my inspiration
Just you 'n me
Simple and free
Baby, you're everything I've ever dreamed of
Yeah, yeah
