Lyrics:


Girl I double dare you, to keep it all the way 100 with me if I'm your man
I'm not gon' lie, I'm scared too, I know you got something to tell me cause you're fucking up your speech
So baby tell me where you were, I'm sick and tired, I know you saw me calling
I think our shit has been over, for a while now

Feels so confused when you say that you don't need me
It's only you that's making you wanna leave me
Where is this trust? I lost it, when you let them fuck, yeah you did yup
Said girl I lost it, I lost it, how could you give it up?

Cause girl you did that that one thing
It's fucked up the way you did that one thing
And I don't care if you was drinking, smoking with your girls and feeling it
How could you consider it? Feels so inconsiderate
Already made your bed, now lay it down and live in it
Stop acting so innocent cause you be on that other shit

Baby how can I compare you to a queen or a diamond in the rough? I'm scared too
Can't even recognize you, don't wanna look at your face, you make me sick, I'mma throw up
When roses turn blueish, that means your garden ain't true yeah, true yeah
I know you let them eat it, yes you did yup, taking food off my plate

Feels so confused when you say that you don't need me
It's only you that's making you wanna leave me
Where is this trust? I lost it, when you let them fuck, yeah you did yup
Said girl I lost it, I lost it, how could you give it up?

Cause girl you did that that one thing
It's fucked up the way you did that one thing
And I don't care if you was drinking, smoking with your girls and feeling it
How could you consider it? Feels so inconsiderate
Already made your bed, now lay it down and live in it
Stop acting so innocent cause you be on that other shit

Girl, yeah you be on that other shit
You be on that other shit
Oh, girl you be on that other shit

Cause girl you did that that one thing
It's fucked up the way you did that one thing
And I don't care if you was drinking, smoking with your girls and feeling it
How could you consider it? Feels so inconsiderate
Already made your bed, now lay it down and live in it
Stop acting so innocent cause you be on that other shit
