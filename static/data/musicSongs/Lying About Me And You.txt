Lyrics:


I should've known better than to kiss you so hard
We had no choice but to fall in love
I should've known better than to take this so far
Can't let him know about the two of us

I'll spend the rest of my life
With a guilty conscience
Don't tell a soul about tonight
To the grave we take this
I'll spend the rest of my life
Spend the rest of my life
Lying about me and you
Lying about me and you
(Who, who, who)
Lying about me and you
(Who, who, who)
I'll spend the rest of my life
Spend the rest of my life
Lying about me and you

I should've known better than to text you late night
Too many drinks and we're vulnerable
I should've known better than to touch you just right
God knows he sure couldn't handle ya

I'll spend the rest of my life
With a guilty conscience
Don't tell a soul about tonight
To the grave we take this
I'll spend the rest of my life
Spend the rest of my life
Lying about me and you
Lying about me and you
(Who, who, who)
Lying about me and you
(Who, who, who)
I'll spend the rest of my life
Spend the rest of my life
Lying about me and you

Can't wait anymore
Close the bedroom door
Up my sheets you crawl
No regrets at all

I'll spend the rest of my life
With a guilty conscience
Don't tell a soul about tonight
To the grave we take this
I'll spend the rest of my life
Spend the rest of my life
Lying about me and you
Lying about me and you
(Who, who, who)
Lying about me and you
(Who, who, who)
I'll spend the rest of my life
Spend the rest of my life
Lying about me and you
