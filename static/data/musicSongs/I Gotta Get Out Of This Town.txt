Lyrics:


I gotta get out of this town
I gotta go some place
I gotta get out of this town
And forget your face

There ain't nothin' I want
From nobody like you
I got some places I itch
I got some scratchin' to do
I gotta get out of this town

I gotta get out of this town
(Gotta get out of this town)
I gotta get me a man
(Gotta get her a man)

I gotta get out of this town
(Gotta get out of this town)
You're more than I can stand
(You're more than she can stand)

I gotta get out of this town
I gotta go somewhere
I gotta get out of this town
I hope it's over there

I'm gonna plant a love tree
I'm gonna pick me some
I want some peaches and cream
I'm tired of nothin' but plums
I gotta get out of this town

I gotta get out of this town
(Gotta get out of this town)
I gotta find me a man
(Gotta find her a man)

I gotta get out of this town
(Gotta get out of this town)
You're more than I can stand
(You're more than she can stand)

I gotta get out of this town
(Gotta get out of this town)
Let me out of this town
(Gotta get out of this town)

I want out of this town
(Gotta get out of this town)
I gotta get out of this town
(Gotta get out of this town)
Gotta get out of this town
(Gotta get out of this town)
