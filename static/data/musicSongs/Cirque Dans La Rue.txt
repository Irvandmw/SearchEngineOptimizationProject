Lyrics:


Take me to the big show
Take me anywhere but here
Put me in the front row
Make my problems disappear

Trapeze high wires
Without a safety net
For the present admission
I wanna witness life or death

All the pretty girls get cut in half while the sad clowns make us laugh

I wanna make friends with the freaks
I wanna throw it down with the clowns that I meet
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street

Invite all the carnies
And the crazy acrobats
And bearded ladies
And the fire breathers
All the people
Just like me

Are you ready to risk it all
And be a human cannon ball?
Sharpen up those knives and throw em'
At the fool against the wall
We're all against that wall

I wanna make friends with the freaks
I wanna throw it down with the clowns that I meet
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street

Invite all the carnies
And the crazy acrobats
And bearded ladies
And the fire breathers
All the people
Just like me

Ladies and Gentlemen
Boys and girls
Come one, come all
To the Cirque dans la rue!
Check your troubles at the door
You don't need em anymore!
Leave reality outside
And come along for the ride
But just remember
While you're watching us
Do the things that we do!

We're watching you

All the pretty girls get cut in half while the sad clowns make us laugh
All the pretty girls get cut in half while the sad clowns make us laugh

I wanna make friends with the freaks
I wanna throw it down with the clowns that I meet
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street

Invite all the carnies
And the crazy acrobats
And bearded ladies
And the fire breathers
All the people
Just like me...

Just like me

I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street

Invite all the carnies
And the crazy acrobats
And bearded ladies
And the fire breathers
All the people
Just like me

All the pretty girls get cut in half while the sad clowns make us laugh
