Lyrics:


Love is the hardest, love is a battle
Oh, love brings out the best, the worst in my shadow
No, love is the greatest gift, let's kiss under the mistletoe
Love is the greatest gift, let's kiss under the mistletoe
Love is the greatest gift, let's kiss under the mistletoe

Oh, I wanna rise to the fight, to the fight
Oh I'm gonna thaw through the ice, through the ice
Yeah, I'm gonna love you in spite, oh in spite of it all
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life

Love is the hardest, love is a war zone
No, love is a thousand question marks etched in black gold
Oh, love teach me all of your lessons here in the North Pole
Love teach me all of your lessons here in the North Pole
Oh, love teach me all of your lessons here in the North Pole

Oh, I wanna rise to the fight, to the fight
Oh I'm gonna thaw through the ice, through the ice
Yeah, I'm gonna love you in spite, oh in spite of it all
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life
Oh, I'm gonna sing for my life, for my life
