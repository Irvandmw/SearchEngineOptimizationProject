Lyrics:


Well, hello, world
Hope you're listening
Forgive me if I'm young
Or speaking out of turn

There's someone
I've been missing
I think that they could be
The better half of me

They're in the wrong place
Trying to make it right
But I'm tired of justifying
So I say to you..

Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
The fight for you is all I've ever known
So come home

I get lost in the beauty
Of everything I see
The world ain't half as bad
As they paint it to be

If all the sons,
All the daughters
Stopped to take it in
Well hopefully the hate subsides
And the love can begin

It might start now, yeah
Well maybe I'm just dreaming out loud
Well, until then...

Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
Right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
The fight for you is all I've ever known
Ever known
So come home

Everything I can't be
Is everything you should be
And that's why I need you here
Everything I can't be
Is everything you should be
And that's why I need you here
So hear this now...

Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
Right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
The fight for you is all I've ever known
Ever known
So come home
Come home
