Lyrics:


[Future (Young Thug):]
One penthouse, two Benz
This for shorty and her girlfriend, yeah
I feel like I'm Hercules, oh
You gone get paid if you work for me, oh

[Young Thug:]
About to feed my dogs, need pedigree, oh
Ain't letting no money get away from me, ohh
TSA ain't ready for me
These bitches wish they was bartenders, just to get next to me
The latest coupe, way too fast, you can't get next to me
And I want the smoke, for real
These 40's, I tote, for real
.45, no colt
Nigga getting left afloat
Nah, we ain't writing no note
Never, nah
I ain't gotta ride to the store no more
I'ma let the Maybach go
The pent got a pole in it
The marvelous Raf Simmons
Four levels in it
I ain't even know you was in it

You can make love in the morning
That Mink flow, I'm warm
Got milly in the safe, come
Nigga get turned upside down
I was rich way before the gang
I was slime way before the name
Kill shit like today
And that's all I gotta say
Ain't leading you wrong

[Future:]
Runnin' the cars
Stealin' bombs
Hope you blow up
All this ice on my neck will make you throw up (yeah)
Flew some bitch from Abu Dhabi, ready to go up (yeah)
Soon as we give it to the streets, the price go up
Up, up out of here, gone to Mercury
All Chanel stores around the globe heard of me
Might as well give it 'em now and catch the first degree
Steven Spielberg shit with the currency
Rock them dog collar chains, P. Diddy (P. Diddy)
I can't let her go nowhere, she too pretty, truthfully
She gone have a bad day, she ever think about crossing me
I done paid all the lawyers, but they can't talk for me
When it come to closing deals, I finger fuck currency
Pop a half a pill and chill, all my ice is currently (all my ice is currently)
Plain jane, Richard Mille, I had to let my wrist breathe (breathe)
Almost got frostbit when I rocked my AP
Give this bitch a minute to breathe
Looks can be deceiving, yeh
Looks can deceiving
We going through like speeding
I fucked this bad European (foreign)
She took the phone, I think she scheming
Ain't been to sleep been stopped dreaming
If it ain't stress, you must be grieving
Looks can be deceiving

[Young Thug:]
You can make love in the morning
That Mink flow, I'm warm
Got milly in the safe, come
Nigga get turned upside down
I was rich way before the gang
I was slime way before the name
Kill shit like today
And that's all I gotta say
Ain't leading you wrong
