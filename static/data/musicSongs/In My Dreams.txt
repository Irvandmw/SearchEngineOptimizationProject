Lyrics:


I'll see you tonight
In the place where we meet in my dreams
I'll hold you tonight
Like I do every night in my dreams
I can't wait for tonight
Is it the same way with you, I hope it is
I hope the dream that you're dreaming
Is the same dream that I'm dreaming too

There may come a day
When I need you outside of my dreams
But until that day
I'll keep you inside of my dreams
I can't wait for tonight
Is it the same way with you, I hope it is
I hope the dream that you're dreaming
Is the same dream that I'm dreaming too

I don't know what's wrong with me
I feel funny inside
And if I never come out of this dream
I'll be satisfied

I'll see you tonight
In the place where we meet in my dreams
I'll hold you tonight
Like I do every night in my dreams
I can't wait for tonight
Is it the same way with you, I hope it is
I hope the dream that you're dreaming
Is the same dream that I'm dreaming too

Mmm, I hope the dream that you're dreaming
Is the same dream that I'm dreaming too
Oh yeah, I hope the dream that you're dreaming
Is the same dream that I'm dreaming too
