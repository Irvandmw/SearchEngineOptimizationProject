Lyrics:


Come all you rounders if you wanna hear
The story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name
On a 6-8-wheeler course he rode to fame
Caller called Casey 'bout half past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said "this is the trip to the Promised Land"

Casey Jones, climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones, orders in his hand
Casey Jones, leanin' out the window
Takin' a trip to the Promised Land

Through South Memphis Yards on a fly
Rain been a fallin' and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones

Well Jones said "Fireman now don't you fret"
Sim Webb said "I ain't a givin' up yet"
We're eight hours late with the southbound mail
We'll be on time or we're leavin' the rails

Casey Jones, climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones, orders in his hand
Casey Jones, leanin' out the window
Takin' a trip to the Promised Land

Dead on the rail was a passenger train
Blood was a boilin' in Casey's brain
Casey said "Hey, look out ahead,
Sim, jump, Sim, jump, or we'll all be dead!"

With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake
North Mississippi was wide awake
IC railroad officials said
"He's a good engineer to be a laying dead"

Casey Jones, climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones, orders in his hand
Casey Jones, leanin' out the window
Takin' a trip to the Promised Land

Headaches and heartaches and all kind of pain
Are all a part of the railroad train
Sweat and toil, the good and the grand
Are part of the life of a railroad man

Casey Jones, climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones, orders in his hand
Casey Jones, leanin' out the window
Takin' a trip to the Promised Land
