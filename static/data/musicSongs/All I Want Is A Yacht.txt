Lyrics:


I can't be nobody else's
I want them bad bitches to myself, 'cause I'm selfish
Lit nigga, girl I know you felt it
Young Ghetto Lenny tried to tell you "I'm for real bitch"

Ain't no effects, we come for the checks
We stirrin' the racks, we trap in the 'jects
We sleepin' in jets, we really the best (Brr, brr, brr)
We pull up and flex, we speakin' baguettes

The niggas done test, and the bitches done text
We came from the bottom, we never forget (Hey, hey, hey)
Death to a coward, I never allow it
Them niggas is jealous, them niggas is sour
They watchin' it glow up
They wantin' the power, I'll aim at your head
I'll send you the flowers, I stand on the couch
I piss on the towels, and sleep in the pools
And fuck in the showers, for all of the days they didn't allow us
Hey, hey, hey, brr

Ain't no effects, we come for the checks
We stirrin' the racks, we sleep the in 'jects
We jump on the jets, my niggas is next
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Fuck on the press, my niggas is next
Foot on they necks, pay no respect
My nigga we blessed, hey-ay-ay-i-ay-i-ay

You ride for the best, I'm here in the flesh
Key to success, you lookin' depressed
You did it to death, you shoot at the head
I shoot at the chest, yeah
Driving the Ghost, my dad was a ghost
The bitch on the side, she don't got on clothes
The moment is close, just watch the approach
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Momma I'm dope, my niggas is dope
They mention my name, I give them approach
She gave you a heart, she gave me her throat
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I got it made, my niggas is made
I'm gettin my money, my nigga I'm paid
The pussy is good, my credit is great

All I want is yacht, and some top, in the coupe, by the spot
And a bad bitch to cook, nigga look
Fuck a book, I never read, everything I got, I took
She on a tape, I'm on a lake, he goin' grill it, nigga-niggas goin' ape
For heavens sake, he straight to play
I lift him up, but hit him up he levi-

I can't be nobody else's
I want them bad bitches to myself, 'cause I'm selfish
Lit nigga, girl I know you felt it
Young Ghetto Lenny tried to tell you "I'm for real bitch"

You ride for the best, I'm here in the flesh
Key to success, you lookin' depressed
You did it to death, you shoot at the head
I shoot at the chest, yeah
Driving the Ghost, my dad was a ghost
The bitch on the side, she don't got on clothes
The moment is close, just watch the approach
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Momma I'm dope, my niggas is dope
The switchup is dope, the pickup is dope
They feelin' a way, they know I'm the G.O.A.T
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I got it made, my niggas is made
I'm gettin my money, my nigga I'm paid
The pussy is good, my credit is great

All I want is yacht
