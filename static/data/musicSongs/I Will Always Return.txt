Lyrics:


I hear the wind call your name
It calls me back home again
It sparks up the fire
A flame that still burns
Oh it's to you I'll always return

I still feel your breath on my skin
I hear your voice deep within
The sound of my lover
A feeling so strong
It's to you I'll always belong

Now I know it's true
My every road leads to you
And in the hour of darkness darlin'
Your light gets me through

Wanna swim in your river
Be warmed by your sun
Bathe in your waters
'Cause you are the one

I can't stand the distance
I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you
Yes, I'm on my way home
I'm on my way

Oh I hear the wind call your name
The sound that leads me home again
It sparks up the fire
A flame that still burns
Oh, it's to you I will always return

Wanna swim in your river
Be warmed by your sun
Bathe in your waters
'Cause you are the one

(can't stand the distance)
I can't stand the distance
I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you
'Cause I'm on my way home

Oh I hear the wind call your name
The sound that leads me home again
It sparks up the fire
A flame that still burns
Yeah I'm on my way

I will always return
Yes I will always return
I've seen every sunset
And with all that I've learned
Oh, it's to you I will always, always return
