Lyrics:


I cried for you now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning that's one thing you're learning

I cried for you oh what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
And I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you now it's your turn to cry over me

(I cried for you) what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
And I found a heart oh just a little bit truer
I cried for you now it's your turn to cry over me
