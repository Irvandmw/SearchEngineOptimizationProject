Lyrics:


[Hook:]
Your man was such a main, girl
That's how I got close to you
You know it's true, you know it's true
Please don't say no names girl
Just do what you're supposed to do
Emotional, emotional girl
Know you got a man girl
He don't even know you
Been with me the whole night
Sweating up the whole room
Just do what I say girl
Everything that does move it
You know that he'll be home soon

[Bridge:]
Can't never let a groupie get to close to you
They always get a little too emotional
Always get a little too emotional
Emotional, emotional
You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do
You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do
You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do
You know you do, you know you do

[Verse 1:]
Thought last night would be the end of that
Thought you could tap that and relax
What you thought you could just send it back
And never really knew that she would get attached
Nothing wrong with a little bad behavior
As long as you don't do nothing to agitate you
She just want cake and wanna eat it too
Birthday suit you can have it later
Can't replace her she's permanent
At least she is in her own eyes
Besides you never had much success
When you cut her off the last 4 times
You know it would be so wise
If you didn't try to tell no lies
Call it lust but she calls it trust
But she poppin up it's like surprise

[Hook:]
Your man was such a main, girl
That's how I got close to you
You know it's true, you know it's true
Please don't say no names girl
Just do what you're supposed to do
Emotional, emotional girl
Know you got a man girl
He don't even know you
Been with me the whole night
Sweating up the whole room
Just do what I say girl
Everything that does move it
You know that he'll be home soon

[Bridge:]
Can't never let a groupie get to close to you
They always get a little too emotional
Always get a little too emotional
Emotional, emotional
You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do
You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do
You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do
You know you do, you know you do

[Verse 2:]
Just stuck in the moment
Laying up in your home and
Time you were supposed to be somewhere else
And I'm realizing who home yet
Got some company on deck
She ain't trying to condone that
She just trying reach out and touch tonight
Now she ain't trying to have phone sex
Got to see you before the club
Feeling like it's way more than love
You would think that she less than tipsy
But seems to me that she poured enough
Lift it up and then hold it up
Who left lipstick all on that soda cup
She just hope that you noticed love
You know wassup, you know wassup

[Hook:]
Your man was such a main, girl
That's how I got close to you
You know it's true, you know it's true
Please don't say no names girl
Just do what you're supposed to do
Emotional, emotional girl
Know you got a man girl
He don't even know you
Been with me the whole night
Sweating up the whole room
Just do what I say girl
Everything that does move it
You know that he'll be home soon

[Bridge:]
Can't never let a groupie get to close to you
They always get a little too emotional
Always get a little too emotional
Emotional, emotional
You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do
You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do
You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do
You know you do, you know you do

[Verse 3:]
Got caught up in that tango whip
Painted dress and them banging legs
Got caught up in that pretty view
And then realize upon came a ledge
Real emotions that came with sex
Plus you stay at that same address
You just had a few steamy nights
And your dirty laundry just made a mess
Clean it up you weren't taught to lose
Pay attention on all the clues
Running through my mind all day
But look at all the mileage she put on your shoes
Wonder where it got off and fuse
You knew the code but broke all the rules
Awkward moment that quick hit
Type of relationship turned chopper screwed
You accepted that offer
And trying to say she's no stalker
A mental clip is full of hollow tips
She gon make you duck and then dodge her
And you kept dodging them cars huh
'Just when you thought that you lost her
She found you quick then on star
Now don't try to say I ain't warn ya
