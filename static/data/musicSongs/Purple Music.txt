Lyrics:


Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high

Some people can't understand
Just bein' inside a church don't make a righteous man
You're high, so high

In time we all die, all music gone
So we better try our best to get along
And get high, so high, oh

Ain't got no theory, ain't got no rules
I just let the purple music tell my body what to do
And I'm high, so high

Every subject, any key
Purple music can't be judged, it happens naturally
It's alright, alright, oh

We'll find a serpent to sacrifice
We'll make a wish and then we'll visit purple paradise
We'll get high, yes we will, so high

Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high

Next page

Don't want reaction, I just want the act
It's easier to give love than it is to give it back
Cuz I'm high, so high

Oh, oh, oh

Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high

I'd love some

I'm high, so high

Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high

We'll find a sacrifice
To get some purple paradise
So nice, purple paradise is so nice
Yeah!

Baby, baby, I say, I say, I say
Oh, oh, oh yeah, oh yeah

If you understand my color
Put your hand in your crotch

No, no, no, no, no, yes!

Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high

Some people can't understand
Just bein' inside a church don't make a righteous man
And you're high

You got to be high

In time we all die, all music gone
So we better try to get along
And get high, so high

All get high

I ain't got no theory, I ain't got no rules
I just let the purple music tell my body what to do
And I'm high, so high

Every subject, any key
Purple music can't be judged, it happens naturally
Ain't it alright?

Ain't it alright?
Don't try to fight it

It's time for your morning bath, sir
What would you like to bathe in this morning?
With all due respect sir, I think that...
I think that it might...
Oh, oh no
I don't want to play anymore
I don't want to play anymore

Purple music does things to my brain and I'm high
Step on it
That's right
Drive, you idiot
Faster, faster!

Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high

Some people can't understand
Just bein' inside a church don't make a righteous man
And you're high, yeah
