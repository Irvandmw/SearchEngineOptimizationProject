Lyrics:


Where does a little tear come from? 
Where does a little... tear... come from? 
It comes from a heart that's been broken apart,  
that's where a little tear comes from! 

Where does a broken heart come from? 
Where does a broken... heart... come from? 
It comes when you find that you love the rovin' kind, 
that's where a broken heart comes from! 

Where does the rovin' kind come from? 
Where does rovin'... kind... come from? 

From the wind and restless river that wanders on forever 
that's where the rovin' comes from! 

Where does the restless river come from? 
Where does restless... river... come from? 
It comes from little tears that are shed through the years 
that's where the restless river comes from... 

...that's where the restless river comes from...
