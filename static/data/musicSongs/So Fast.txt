Mmh, mmh
Ayy Royce, you did it right here!

Mmh, I be in the real one going so fast
Mmh, poured out the 8, I'm getting so slapped (Getting so slapped)
Mmh, pass it to my bro he gon' smack that (Lil' bitch!)
Whippin' on the road, we tryin' get that (Tryna get that)
Mmh, I be in the real one going so fast
Mmh, poured out the 8, I'm getting so slapped
Mmh, pass it to my bro he gon' smack that (Smacked that)
Whippin' on the road, we tryin' get that

Mmh, I be smoking boof pack,.30 on me, two-sack
I just rock some bands, and she want me so bad
Look at all of them, they noticed
When you front the cash, they think that they can do this
Yeah my bands flew out, then I smoked this
You ain't never seen money, yeah I noticed
This fly I just mixed, feel like a space man, yeah
Twenty racks, up in the spaceship

What you on, lil baby, what you on?
Thirty on my wrist and that shit will last a hunnid
We can make it two, cause baby I am not one
And you a model looking better than everyone, yeah

Mmh, I be in the real one going so fast
Mmh, poured out the 8, I'm getting so slapped (Getting so slapped)
Mmh, pass it to my bro he gon' smack that (Lil' bitch!)
Whippin' on the road, we tryin' get that (Tryna get that)
Mmh, I be in the real one going so fast
Mmh, poured out the 8, I'm getting so slapped
Mmh, pass it to my bro he gon' smack that (Smacked that)
Whippin' on the road, we tryin' get that
Mmh, I be in the real one going so fast
Mmh, poured out the 8, I'm getting so slapped
Mmh, pass it to my bro he gon' smack that (Smacked that)
Whippin' on the road, we tryin' get that

Taking off like a rocket bitch, I got six bands in my pocket
Yuh niggas, here, take a niggas watches
Fake nigga's diamonds, gotta put them on the watches
I still bounced out, with the chopstick, uh
My brother Taz said, "Watch this", then he popped him
We was living on the streets, so how could I stop him?
Now, we living how we dreamed but he cannot watch this
So I told him over seas, I'm finna rock it

What you on, lil baby, what you on?
Thirty on my wrist and that shit will last a hunnid
We can make it two, cause baby I am not one
And you a model looking better than everyone, yeah

Mmh, I be in the real one going so fast
Mmh, poured out the 8, I'm getting so slapped
Mmh, pass it to my bro he gon' smack that (Smacked that)
Whippin' on the road, we tryin' get that
Mmh, I be in the real one going so fast
Mmh, poured out the 8, I'm getting so slapped
Mmh, pass it to my bro he gon' smack that (Smacked that)
Whippin' on the road, we tryin' get that
