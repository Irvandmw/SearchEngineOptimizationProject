Lyrics:


I don't know when we fall apart
The love that we had was like a work of art
I used to see heaven in your eyes
Now angels are falling from your skies
The things we said were so wrong
And I haven't held you for so long
My foolish pride, tears me inside
Why did we tell all those lies
But you can reach for the phone, you don't have to be alone

Outside the wind it seem so cold (cold)
Your heart is frozen like the snow (snow)
And there's no one home to keep you safe and warm (ooh)
You're eyes are red because you cried (cried)
You fell asleep by the fireside (fireside)
But there's one thing you should know, one this Christmas, baby, you don't have to be alone

And I had only one wish on my list
For me you would be the perfect gift (ooh)
There's nothing colder than an empty home (empty home, ooh)
And holidays were never meant to be alone (to be alone)
The smile we gave, when our hearts saved by each others love and warmth
That's subsided now, no happiness around
If I can only find the way to your heart

Outside the wind it seems so cold (so cold, so cold)
Your heart is frozen like the snow (frozen like the snow, frozen cold)
And there's no one home (no one home) to keep you safe and warm (keep you safe and warm no)
You're eyes are red because you've cried (you've cried)
You fell asleep by the fireside (by the fireside)
But there's one thing you should know (one thing you should know)
On this Christmas baby, you don't have to be alone (yeah)

You don't (no, no) have to be alone
You don't have to be (no, no) all alone (on Christmas)
You don't have to be alone (you don't have to be alone) you don't have to be alone

Outside the wind it seems so cold (sing it baby, so cold)
You're heart is frozen like the snow (frozen like the snow, like the snow)
And there's no one home (no one home) to keep you safe and warm (to keep you safe and warm, you don't have to be alone)
You're eyes are red because you've cried (you've cried)
You fell asleep by the fireside (by the fireside)
But there's one thing you should know (one thing you should know)
On this Christmas baby, you don't have to be alone (yeah)
