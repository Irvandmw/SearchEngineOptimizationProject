Lyrics:


Why does it have to be tomorrow?
I'd like to stay here just one more day
I haven't got the time you need to borrow
So I'll give you all I've got
Though I haven't got a lot
And you know the things you love most fade away

Sometimes the things that you love most fade away
Like a shadow disappearing in the night
Sometimes the things that you love most fade away
But now is not the right time
'Cause loving you would only bring us both a lot of pain

Don't let the morning come between us
Always be together anyway
Memories can never really leave us
So I'll give you all I've got
Though I haven't got a lot
And you know the things you love most fade away

So until I have to go
Let's pretend that we don't know
That sometimes the things you love most fade away

Sometimes the things that you love most fade away
Like a shadow disappearing in the night
Sometimes the things that you love most fade away
But now is not the right time
'Cause loving you would only bring us both a lot of pain

Sometimes the things that you love most fade away
Like a shadow disappearing in the night...
