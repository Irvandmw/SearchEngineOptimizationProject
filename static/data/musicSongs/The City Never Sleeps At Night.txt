Lyrics:


Old man, young man
Preacher saying amen
Taking up collection
Playing on a bass drum
How come the city it never sleeps at night

Red cars, blue cars
Payment overdue cars
Cops with indigestion
Billionaires and some bums
How come the city it never sleeps at night
How come the city it never sleeps at night

Short girls, tall girls
Happy that they're all girls
Walking with some nice man
Holding hands and then some
How come the city it never sleeps at night

Good guys, bad guys
Millionaires and show guys
Losers with their hands out
Patients begging breadcrumb
How come the city it never sleeps at night
The city it never sleeps at night

Long night, short night
Big hellos and goodbyes
Dreams of conversation
Not a single ho-hum
How come the city it never sleeps at night

Old man, young man
Preacher saying amen
Taking up collection
Playing on a bass drum
How come the city it never sleeps at night

It never sleeps at night
