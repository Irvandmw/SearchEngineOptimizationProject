Lyrics:


(Oh come back to me, Oh come back to me, 
Red Sailors, Red Sailors, bring my love to me!) 

'Twas down where fisher-folk gather, 
I wandered far from the throng,  
I heard a fisher-girl singing,  
And this refrain was her song . . .  

(Oh O'oo!) 

Red sails in the sunset, 
Way out on the sea, 
Oh carry my loved one  
Home safely to me . . .  

He sailed at the dawning,  
All day I've been blue,  
Red sails in the sunset, 

I'm trusting in you . . .  

Swift wings you must borrow,  
Make straight for the shore, 
We marry tomorrow,  
And he goes sailin' no more . . . 

Red sails in the sunset, 
Way out on the sea, 
Oh carry my loved one  
Home safely to me . . .  

Oh carry my loved one  
Home safely to me . . .
