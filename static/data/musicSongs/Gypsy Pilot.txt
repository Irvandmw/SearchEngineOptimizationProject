Lyrics:


When I was a young boy
My mama told me son
You gotta keep it together
You know you're the only one

So I tried to see the sunshine
And tried to feel the rain
But I just couldn't get it together
I was feelin' too much pain

So I got myself a guitar
When I was just a kid
I played rock and roll music
And I'm so glad I did

'Cause now I see the sunshine
And now I feel the rain
And I just want to keep it together
And hope you feel the same

Now I see the sunshine
And now I feel the rain
And I just want to keep it together
And hope you feel the same

Now I jump in my covered wagon
I'm movin' right along
I'm a full fledged gypsy pilot
I'm singin' you my song

And I try to see the sunshine
And I try to feel the rain
And I just want to keep it together
And I hope you feel the same

When they claim my body
They won't have much to say
Except that he lived a good life
He lived every day

And I know he saw the sunshine
And I know he felt the rain
And he loved everybody
And he hopes you'll do the same
