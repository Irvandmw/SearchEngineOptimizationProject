Pass in front of me like I'm a hashtag (Hey)
I stuffing piles of California weed inside a trash bag (Gang)
I just be counting up like I'm in math class (Woo)
If she adding dollars up, she need a trash bag (Aye)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, go get the trash bag (oh yeah)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, go get the trash bag (oh yeah)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, go get the trash bag (Yeah)
And I just be counting up like I'm in math class (Oh yeah)

I fell in love with the fast cash (Aye)
I'm pulling up with a trash bag (Bags)
You run the city with bag tags (Tags)
We got these fuck niggas mad (Mad)
Whole lotta red in my heart
I'ma cover it up with the money (Aye)
I just hung up on a bitch cause she lying
She say that she love me (She love me)
They thought I can go get a bag but I didn't
Just me and my niggas (Just me and my niggas)
They counted us out from the very beginning
And now bitch we winning (Win)

Pass in front of me like I'm a hashtag (Hey)
I stuffing piles of California weed inside a trash bag (Gang)
I just be counting up like I'm in math class (Woo)
If she adding dollars up, she need a trash bag (Aye)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, go get the trash bag (oh yeah)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, go get the trash bag (oh yeah)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, go get the trash bag (Yeah)
And I just be counting up like I'm in math class (Oh yeah)

Soon as I get off the clock, I'm gonna put in some overtime
(Some overtime)
Don't gotta ask about the city, the young niggas know it's mine (Blood)
I'm kicking shit with convicted felons
Snuck in the club with two different weapons (Aye)
Walking around with a trash bag
Somebody help me, it's getting heavy
I see that these young niggas satisfied
Get out my way 'cause I'm hungry (Blah)
Brought niggas food on the plate (Woo)
Sitting here, rubbing my stomach (Aye)
Money turned me into a savage (Savage)
These niggas ain't living like me (No)
I'm cut from a whole different fabric (Aye)
They know I'm as real as can be (Huh)

Pass in front of me like I'm a hashtag (Hey)
I stuffing piles of California weed inside a trash bag (Gang)
I just be counting up like I'm in math class (Woo)
If she adding dollars up, she need a trash bag (Aye)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, go get the trash bag (oh yeah)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, go get the trash bag (oh yeah)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, go get the trash bag (Yeah)
And I just be counting up like I'm in math class (Oh yeah)

Oh yeah, oh yeah
