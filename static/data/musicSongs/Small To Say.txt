Lyrics:


Caressed by the wings you've given me
Beautifully delivered me
I tried so hard to keep
Looking at you to stand strong

Beneath the dirt 
That I have thrown at you
They seeds you've sown 
Have grown into my bloodline
And my veins will too

And I want you
And my trust has been so broken
And I need you
To step inside and feel the way I feel

And I want you
And my trust has been so broken
And I need you
To step inside and feel the way I feel

Despite the endless times
I've failed for you
And the wooden cross
I nailed you to
I just want you to know
I meant every single word
I said to you

I raise this cup I call my life
I stand alone and hold it high
I won't spill, 'cause I'll hold it tight

And I want you
And my trust has been so broken
And I need you
To step inside and feel the way I feel

And I want you
And my trust has been so broken
And I need you
To step inside and feel the way I feel

And I wonder how
It's going to come together
And don't look now
But things are looking better

I wonder if you'll ever meet
This screaming boy inside of me
It's like an earthquake
When I hold it in, and hold in in

Again...

I wonder if you'll ever see
All the things I wanna be
And it's so much more to me
'Cause it's so much more to you

I wonder if you'll ever meet
This screaming boy inside of me
It's like an earthquake
When I hold it in, and hold in in

Again...

And I want you
And my trust has been so broken
And I need you
To step inside and feel the way I feel

And I want you
And my trust has been so broken
And I need you
To step inside and feel the way I feel

And I want you
And my trust has been so broken
And I need you
To step inside and feel the way I feel

And I want you
And my heart has been so broken
And I need you
To step inside
Step, step inside
