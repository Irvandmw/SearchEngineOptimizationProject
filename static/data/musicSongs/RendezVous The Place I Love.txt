Lyrics:


Take me to the place I love
Hey, wooh, go
You ready fellas?
Woh-oh, wooh

Come on baby
Itâs 5 A.M.
Gotta get up
Catch that train again
Soon be over
Just another day
So come on down and dance
Your blues away

Canât wait for night to fall
My girl knows that secret call
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Woh-oh, ooh, hey

When the pressure gets too much
She knows a rendez-vous thatâs right For us
Two blocks down, three flights up
Take me to the place
Take me to the place I love, I love

I hear the music
Three knocks on the door
Grab a table
And the drinks are poured
Iâll serenade you
Step out on the floor
Hold me closer
âTil the break of dawn, woh

Sunlight is creeping in
I donât want this night to end
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Woh-oh
You know what, itâs the place to be
Ooh, hey

When the pressure gets too much, come on
She knows a rendez-vous thatâs right for us
Two blocks down, three flights up
Take me to the place
Take me to the place I love, ooh

When the pressure gets too much
She knows a rendez-vous thatâs right for us
Two blocks down, three flights up
Take me to the place
Take me to the place I love
Bring it back
I love
Listen

Who needs the weekend?
We make the rules
Just solve the puzzle
Now hereâs the clues
Letâs rendez-vous
Iâm a-take you back
A little bump and grind
Turn up the vibe
Now hit me with a double clap

Sunlight is creeping in
I donât want this night to end
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Woh-oh, ooh, hey

When the pressure gets too much
You know what
She knows a rendez-vous thatâs right for us, hey
Two blocks down, three flights up
Take me to the place
Take me to the place I love
Come on baby

When the pressure gets too much
She knows a rendez-vous thatâs right for us
Two blocks down, three flights up, three flights up
Take me to the place
Take me to the place I love

Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
Rendez-vous, letâs boogie down tonight
[repeat till end]

(You know what, itâs the place to be)
