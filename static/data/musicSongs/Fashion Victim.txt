Lyrics:


I hate fashion, I hate it with a passion
Are you a fashion victim? Are you a fashion victim?
Are you a fashion victim? I bet you are

I see them on the video, they're wearin' fashion shoes
They're singin' 'bout their troubles, they never paid their dues
The rhythm's in the background, the fashion's in the front
They tricked us out of music with this latest fashion stunt

I hate fashion, I hate it with a passion
Are you a fashion victim? Are you a fashion victim?
Are you a fashion victim? I bet you are

The candidate is handsome, he's wearin' tailored clothes
He's following the pollster everywhere he goes
His teeth have all been straightened, his hair is very full
His stupidity is hidden by this image-making bull

I hate fashion, I hate it with a passion
Are you a fashion victim? Are you a fashion victim?
Are you a fashion victim? I bet you are

School is just a showcase where fashion children go
As long as they look cool, there's little they should know
Ideas have no power when people cannot read
Fashion can go sour, it's not cool to be in need

I hate fashion, I hate it with a passion
Are you a fashion victim? Are you a fashion victim?
Are you a fashion victim? I bet you are

How did the land of Jefferson, how did the land of King
Become the land of hamburgers and raisins that can sing?
Roosevelt was cripple, Lincoln was a geek
They'd never get elected, their clothes were never chic

I hate fashion, I hate it with a passion
Are you a fashion victim? Are you a fashion victim?
Are you a fashion victim? I bet you are
