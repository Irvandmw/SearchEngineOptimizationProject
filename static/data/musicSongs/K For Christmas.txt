Lyrics:


(Ayy, Royce you did it right here)

I woke up this morning (Oh)
Hunnid K and bitches (Bitches)
And somebody warn him (Nigga warn him)
I just got a K for Christmas (Brrra!)
I woke up this morning (This morning)
Hunnid K and bitches (And bitches)
And somebody warn him (Nigga warn him)
I just got a K for Christmas (For Christmas)

Hunnid bands this morning
Got me thinkin' it's a good ass day (It's a good day)
I walk around, my ice it's frozen
I got some more bands today (Bands today)
I was in the snow, I started floatin' (Started floatin')
I poured a cup of Bombay (Poured a cup)
I don't feel like talkin' 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin')
I ran in his crib, today (Yeah I did)
I up in the money, speed at night time (Skrt skrt)
I just got that bread you made your lifetime (Uh huh)
You just got a Rollie and can't tell time (No you can't)
I just got a Rollie iced out, it shine

I woke up this morning (Oh)
Hunnid K and bitches (Bitches)
And somebody warn him (Nigga warn him)
I just got a K for Christmas (Brrra!)
I woke up this morning (This morning)
Hunnid K and bitches (And bitches)
And somebody warn him (Nigga warn him)
I just got a K for Christmas (For Christmas)

(And somebody warn him
I just got a K for Christmas)
