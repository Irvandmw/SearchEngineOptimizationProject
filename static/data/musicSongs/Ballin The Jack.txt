[DM] Are you ready
[PB] Ready and waiting sir [DM] Well ok

[DM] First you put your two knees close up tight
[DM] Then you sway 'em to the left and then you sway 'em to the right
[DM] Step around the floor kinda nice and light
[Both] Then you twist around twist around with all of your might
[DM] Put your loving arms straight out in space
[Both] Do the easy rock with style and grace
[DM] Swing your foot way around and bring it back
[DM] Now that's what I call ballin' the jack

[DM] First you put your two knees close up tight
[DM] Then you sway 'em to the left and then you sway 'em to the right
