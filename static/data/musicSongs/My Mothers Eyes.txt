Lyrics:
Lyrics:


One bright and guiding light
That taught me wrong from right
I found in my mother's eyes

Those baby tales she told
That road all paved with gold
I found in my mother's eyes

Just like a wandering sparrow
One lonely soul
I walked the straight and narrow
To reach my goal

God's gift sent from above
A real unselfish love
I found in my mother's eyes

Just like a wandering sparrow
One little lonely soul
I tried to walk the straight and narrow
To reach my goal

God's gift sent from above
A real unselfish love
I found in my mother's eyes
