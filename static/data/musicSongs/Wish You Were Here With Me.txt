Lyrics:


Funny how the years,
They just pass us by
Seems like yesterday,
You were in my life
You always wanted to start a family
I was way too young,
I was runnin' free

[Chorus]
If you could only see me now,
You'd realise
I'm not the boy who made you cry
You gave yourself,
I didn't see it
You died in me,
I should have saved you
Wish you were here with me

I thought i knew it all,
How stupid could i be
I think of what i had,
And it makes me weep

[Repeat chorus]

Sometimes,
You hurt the ones who love you most
And sometimes,
You hold the ones who leave you lost
And sometimes
You learn, but it's too late
It's too late

You gave yourself,
I didn't see it
You died in me,
I should have saved you
You gave yourself
Why did you give youself to me
You died in me,
Why was i too blind to see
Wish you were here with me

(funny how the years, they just pass us by)
