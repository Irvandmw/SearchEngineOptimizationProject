Lyrics:


Oh it's a good day, for singing this song
and it's a good day, for moving along
Yes it's a good day, how could anything go wrong?
It's a good day from morning till night

Yes it's a good day for paying for shining your shoes
and it's a good day, for loosing the blues
anything to gain and nothing to loose
cause it's a good day from morning till night (you're right!)

I said to the sun, good morning sun
Rise and shine today
You know you got to get going if you're gonna make a showin
And you know you'll got that right away

Cause it's a good day, for paying your bills
And it's a good day, for killing your ills
So take a deep breath throw away all your pills
Cause it's a good day from morning till night

Just this very day i said to the sun: "Good morning sun"
Rise and shine (why don't you rise and shine)
You know you got to get going if you're gonna make a showin
And you know you'll got that right away

Cause it's a good day, for paying your bills
And it's a good day, for killing your ills
So take a deep breath (ahhh) throw away all your pills
Cause it's a good day from morning till night
say that again
yes it's a good day from morning till night
that's what he said
cause it's a good day from morning till niiiiight!
