Lyrics:


I'm wandering
Been moving to and fro
Just wandering
With no place to go
Since I lost you, lost you
All I ever do
Is be wandering
'Til I wander back to you

Oh I'm wishing
Been yearning for your kiss
Oh and I've been missing
The warmth of your caress
Since I lost you, I've lost you
All I ever do
Is be wandering, wandering
Wandering, wandering
I'll be wandering, 'til I wander back to you

I look on every corner, down every dismal street
Are you there? Are you there? Oh darling I repeat
I visit all familiar places, there's no one there but me
Where can you be? Where can you be? Oh darling where can you be?

Oh I'm praying
Your touch for me has grown
Oh and I'm saying
For before it's not been known
I love you, I love you
And all I ever do
Is be wandering, crying
Wandering, wandering
I'll be wandering
'Til I wander, 'til I wander back to you
Yeah, oh yeah
I'm gonna be wandering
'Till I wander back to you
Yeah, yeah
Oh wandering back to you
