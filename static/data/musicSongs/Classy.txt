Lyrics:


Culture travelled out from the rabble
And had a saddle placed on its back
While the vets cheered t'was ridden to death dear
By the kind whose nerve never cracks

Guess the class-ah of the white Rasta
And I will buy your very next meal
Sausage supper says middle or upper
And when he speaks the winner's revealed

That's how it is you see
It shouldn't have to be
This way that unearned wealth
Perpetuates itself

You're not fooling me private schooling
Claiming you are charity
Those you help most own half the West Coast
And the odd distillery

That's how it is you see
It shouldn't have to be
This way that unearned wealth
Perpetuates itself

Cross the Atlantic, it's just as frantic
Riches pleading poverty
When your daddy lends you a million
You can lead the land of the free

That's how it is you see
It shouldn't have to be
This way that unearned wealth
Perpetuates itself

That's how it is you see
It shouldn't have to be
This way that unearned wealth
Perpetuates itself
