Lyrics:


The beautiful days are long gone
I canât seem to breathe
It feels like it hasnât been that long
Since you walked away from me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know I still think of you that way
You should knowâ¦that

The beautiful lights the star filled nights
They donât mean a thing
Cause you were my star and so it donât seem right
Without you here with me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know its hard for me to say
You were my soulâ¦

Now I could say that I donât love you no more
And I could say that Iâve closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel Itâs time for us to go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldnât be the same
Cause girl your love is still on my brain 

Now when your in love it takes time to heal
When someoneâs broken your heart it changes how you feel
Girl I thought that youâd never do me that way
But even after all I still think of you that way

Now I could say that I donât love you no more
(I could say this and I could say that)
And I could say that Iâve closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel Itâs time for us to go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldnât be the same
Cause girl your love is still on my brain

Now love is a game that we both like to play
But will I win or lose if I go or if I stay
Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside
Girl you know me inside out and I canât get you off my mind

Now I could say that I donât love you no more
And I could say that Iâve closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel Itâs time for us to go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldnât be the same
Cause girl your love is still on my brain
