Lyrics:


Come on baby
Come on girl
Lemme rock ya world
I'm probably gonna rock ya world
I said come on baby
Come on girl
Lemme rock ya world
I'm probably gonna rock ya world

So come on baby
I've been lonely lately
So come on hold me
Let's make a baby
Calling my lady girl, calling my lady
Don't be shady, don't be shady girl

Come on baby
Come on girl
Lemme rock ya world
I'm probably gonna rock ya world
I said Come on baby
Come on girl
Lemme rock ya world
I'm probably gonna rock ya world

Lord knows I need ya, girl
'Cause the hole in my heart could fill the world
So come on baby
Come on now
I was high as a kite
But like The Price Is Right, I'm comin' down
Girl I'm comin'
Comin' for you
And by the end of the night, you gon' be comin' too
Uh, I said girl I'm comin'
Comin' for you
And by the end of the night, you gon' be comin' too

Come on baby
Come on girl
Lemme rock ya world
I'm probably gonna rock ya world
I said Come on baby
Come on girl
Lemme rock ya world
I'm probably gonna rock ya world
