Lyrics:


Nobody drives to the middle of nowhere
Just to turn around, to turn around (Hey)
Nobody sleeps in the middle of the bed
When they got someone else, someone else (Hey)
And nobody walks up the stairway to heaven
Just to walk back down

'Cause it's there or it's not, it's heartbreak or it's love
There's no such thing as halfway
You're in or outta luck, we made it or we lost
There's no such thing as halfway (Hey)

Nobody's searching for the middle of the rainbow
To find the gold, to find the gold (Hey)
Nobody sails to the middle of the ocean and calls it home
And calls it home (Hey)
And nobody stands in the middle of the dance floor
To dance alone

'Cause it's there or it's not, it's heartbreak of it's love
There's no such thing as halfway
You're in or outta luck, we made it or we lost
There's no such thing as halfway

Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
(Hey)

So here we are in this halfway house
There's no way in and there's no way out
If you stay or if you go
I don't care, just let me know
If you feel it, do you feel it?

'Cause it's there or it's not, it's heartbreak or it's love
There's no such thing as halfway
You're in or outta luck, we made it or we lost
There's no such thing as halfway
(Hey, yeah)
There's no such thing as halfway
(Hey, yeah)
There's no such thing as halfway
(Hey)
