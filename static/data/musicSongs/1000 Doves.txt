Lyrics:


I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

'Cause inside we are really made the same
In life, waiting's just a stupid game

Lift me up, give me a start
Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

A thousand do-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ves
Oh-oh
A thousand do-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ves
Oh-oh

I'd do anything for you to really see me
I am human invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall

I cry more than I ever say
Each time your love seems to save the day

Lift me up, give me a start
Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

A thousand do-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ves
Oh-oh
A thousand do-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ves
Oh-oh

I've been hurting, stuck inside a cage
So hot my heart's been in a rage
If you love me, then just set me free
And if you don't, then baby leave
Set me free

Lift me up, give me a start
Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

A thousand do-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ves
Oh-oh
Flying, flying, flying like a thousand doves
A thousand do-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ves
Oh-oh
Flying, flying, flying like a thousand doves
Flying, flying, flying
