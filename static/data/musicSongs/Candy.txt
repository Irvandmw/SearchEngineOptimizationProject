Lyrics:


I can name a couple ways, baby, this shit might go
You just might forget that this was what you're getting high for
And it might do the things to him, I mean the guy who
He's the one who's sweet enough, who'll shoot to make that high note

And it's such a typical thing
Running over a billion men.
Running through a difficult place
You don't need no blood on your hands, no

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

I can be your sugar when you're fiending for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'till your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby I got everything and so much more than she's got

And it's such a typical thing
Running over a billion men.
Running through a difficult place
You don't need no blood on your hands, no

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
[x2]

Sugar coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper
[x2]

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
[x2]
