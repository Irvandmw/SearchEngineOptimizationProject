Lyrics:


It feels like the end of the world
It seems like nobody cares
Is it real or am I going insane?
Am I ever gunna change my ways?
Isolated, separated, sick of the mess I created
The pressure keeps rising
When the truth is what I'm fighting

We march out of the darkness
We revel in the flames
The mission is accomplished
We're ready for the change
and the only thing that will set us free is living through the pain
and the only thing that I'll guarantee, we'll never be the same

It feels like I'm still in a cage 
and I scream till I'm blue in the face
Is it real or is it a faze?
I think the time has come to change my ways
I'm ready and willing to take what I've been giving
The pressure keeps rising 'cause the truth is what I'm fighting

We march out of the darkness
We revel in the flames
The mission is accomplished
We're ready for the change
and the only thing that will set us free, is living though the pain
and the only thing that I'll guarantee, we'll never be the same

It's ok, it's alright
Just let go you'll be fine [x2]
It's ok, it's alright
Just let go you'll be fine

We march out of the darkness
We revel in the flames
The mission is accomplished
We're ready for the change
and the only thing that will set us free is living through the pain
and the only thing I'll guarantee, we'll never be the same

It's ok it's alright 
Just let go you'll be fine [x4]
