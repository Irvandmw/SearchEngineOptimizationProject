Lyrics:


[Lee:]
I can tell by your eyes that you've probably been crying forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing' to you, they're a mirror

[All:]
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, whoa, heart?

[Lee:]
If I stand all alone, will the shadows hide the colors of my heart

[All:]
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
The star in the sky don't mean nothin' to you, they're a mirror

[Lee:]
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, whoa, heart?
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke this old heart

If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, whoa, heart?
My heart, whoa, heart
