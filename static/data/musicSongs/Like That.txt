Lyrics:


You one of a kind I hope you know that
I ain't trying to keep it low I don't like that
Yes I like a young freak hope you bite back
I'm just trying to keep peace I won't fight back
Hope you like that I hope you like that, hope you like that I hope you like that baby
You one of a kind I hope you know that
I ain't trying to keep it low I don't like that
Yes I like a young freak I won't bite back
I'm just trying to keep peace I won't fight back
Hope you like that I hope you like that, hope you like that I hope you like that baby

Baby looking fine, I'm just trying to get close to you
I just want to dine, I don't know if that shit new to you but
What you doing right now, can I come though are you down right now
Ask me what it do I said ''you now now'', your ex not cool got to move now now
I love the type of shit that we be on you got me drunk, yea you got me thinking how I came up on
She put you on now I'm on my evil shit, this gon' be your fucking favorite song

You one of a kind I hope you know that
I ain't trying to keep it low I don't like that
Yes I like a young freak hope you bite back
I'm just trying to keep peace I won't fight back
Hope you like that I hope you like that, hope you like that I hope you like that baby
You one of a kind I hope you know that
I ain't trying to keep it low I don't like that
Yes I like a young freak I won't bite back
I'm just trying to keep peace I won't fight back
Hope you like that I hope you like that, hope you like that I hope you like that baby

I said I'm in town she said come around
You know how it sound we got two more rounds
What do you say are you coming my way, I seen you today I'm not trying to play, I'm just trying to lay
I got bitches and you got niggas so
We should try them both I don't really know
Can you drop it low I'mma make it snow
Throwing 20's on you

You one of a kind I hope you know that
I ain't trying to keep it low I don't like that
Yes I like a young freak hope you bite back
I'm just trying to keep peace I won't fight back
Hope you like that I hope you like that, hope you like that I hope you like that baby
You one of a kind I hope you know that
I ain't trying to keep it low I don't like that
Yes I like a young freak I won't bite back
I'm just trying to keep peace I won't fight back
Hope you like that I hope you like that, hope you like that I hope you like that baby
