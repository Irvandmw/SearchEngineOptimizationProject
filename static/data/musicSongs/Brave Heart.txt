Lyrics:


Each and every day it's the same old game
And I play along
Round and round we go but we never know
When we should get off

And we both tried, but that's just life
And now coming to an end
The tears have dried, made up my mind
And I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
Oh oh oh ohhhh-ohhhhh
Out here alone, but I still got one thing left
Oh oh oh ohhhh-ohhhhh
I've got a brave heart
I've got a brave heart
I got a brave heart

I guess the safer play would've been to stay
And just make it work
But the other side is calling me tonight
Even though it hurts

And we both tried, but that's just life
And now coming to an end
The tears have dried, made up my mind
And I'm, I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
Oh oh oh ohhhh-ohhhhh
Out here alone, but I still got one thing left
Oh oh oh ohhhh-ohhhhh
I've got a brave heart
I've got a brave heart
I got a brave heart

I don't know, know, where we're going
I can't read, read, our fate in the stars
I don't know, know, where I'm heading
So Just know, know, you're stealing my heart
I wouldn't change a single page of our history
I'm gonna keep all the letters you wrote to me

Each and every day it's the same old game
And I play along
Round and round we go but we never know
When we should get off

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
Out here alone, but I still got one thing left
I've got a brave heart
I've got a brave heart
I got a brave heart
