Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

They know what is, know what is
Know what is what, they know what is

Know what is, they know what is what
They know what is, know what is
Know what is what, they know what is
