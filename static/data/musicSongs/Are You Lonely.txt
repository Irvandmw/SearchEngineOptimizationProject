Lyrics:


I know that you're calling me
To light up a leather shadow
That follows you underneath
I know that you're calling me

I don't wanna play it safe
'Cause I don't get down like that
Just keep falling into me
I know I got your back

Are you lonely
Are you lonely
Are you lonely
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you

Are you lonely
Are you lonely
Are you lonely
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you

Who ever said it was easy
They never know or do
Oh when these walls fall down
I'll stand by you
What you believe in
I'll give it to you
'Cause when these walls fall down
I'll stand by you

Are you lonely
Are you lonely
Are you lonely
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you

Are you lonely
Are you lonely
Are you lonely
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
