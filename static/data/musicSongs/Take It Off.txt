Lyrics:


[Bebe Rexha:]
Just wiped the lipstick of my lips
I wanna feel you in the kiss
Don't make me work so hard for it
Nothing I want more than this

[Julia Michaels:]
You know I put it on, just so you could take it off
You know I put it on, just so you could take it off
I want you so bad, want you so bad
You know I put it on...

[Bebe Rexha:]
Just so you could take it off
Just so you could take it off
Just so you could take it...
I want you so bad, want you so bad
I put it on baby, on baby

(Just so you could take it...)

You say I've got too many walls
'Cause I've been hurt, it's not my fault
I built them up now make them fall
I want you to have it all

[Julia Michaels:]
You know I put it on, just so you could take it off
You know I put it on, just so you could take it off
I want you so bad, want you so bad
You know I put it on...

[Bebe Rexha:]
Just so you could take it off
Just so you could take it off
Just so you could take it...
I want you so bad, want you so bad
I put it on baby, on baby

(Just so you could take it...)

I got my body in your hands
Now watch me come at your command, oh yeah
I'll do the greatest shit, yeah
I'll give you all of me tonight, give you all of me tonight
I said, I'll give you all of me tonight
I'll give you all of me tonight
I said, I'll give you all of me tonight

[Julia Michaels:]
You know I put it on, just so you could take it off
You know I put it on, just so you could take it off
I want you so bad, want you so bad
You know I put it on...

[Bebe Rexha:]
Just so you could take it off
Just so you could take it off
Just so you could take it...
I want you so bad, want you so bad
I put it on baby, on baby

(Just so you could take it...)
