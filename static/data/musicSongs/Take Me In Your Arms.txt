Lyrics:


Once upon a lovely time
Many million dreams ago
Once there was a man in love dear
Many million dreams ago

Once he thought he had a sweetheart
Then he broke the golden rule
Never take your love for granted
Wise men often play the fool

Now he'd like to say I'm sorry
Can't you see within his heart
Without you there's no tomorrow
Why should true love have to part

Take me in your arms
I promise to be true
Never again I'll stray
Away from you

Take me in your arms
I promise to be true
Never again I'll stray
Away from you
