Lyrics:


This world has taken me by storm
It makes me feel like running
This place is making me transform
Until I feel like nothing

It's the strength in you and me
That surrounds everything
The way you look out for me
The way you burn

It's the flame in all of us
The same that makes us feel this
Flame in all of us, the same
That makes us feel it

We are the youth of yesterday
We've brought you pain and sorrow
That's what they say, but they paved the way
We are the new tomorrow

It's the strength in you and me
That surrounds everything
The way you look out for me
The way you burn

It's the flame in all of us
The same that makes us feel this
Flame in all of us the same
That makes us

It's the flame in all of us
The same that makes us feel this
Flame in all of us
The same that makes us feel it

It's the flame in all of us that makes
The change in all of us
That takes the blame in all of us
And still keeps it alive

It's the flame in all of us that makes
The change in all of us
That takes the blame in all of us
And still keeps it alive
