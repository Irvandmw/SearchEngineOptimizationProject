Lyrics:


Carry me up them stairs with my white socks on
And my pretty song.
You like my blue nail polish.
"What is all this?" 
you said, "The mess upstairs."
Don't be scared.

Daddy dearest,
You know how I like to take trips.
Pops first stop at the K-Mart.
Buy me my peach lip gloss.
Cigarettes and lollipops.
Mad magazine and white socks.
All in your car for our trip across the USA.

We're gonna party like it's 1949.
We're in the Pontiac from July to July.
It's a flower motel nation.
Day and night on our last vacation.
We're gonna see it all before we say goodbye.

Daddy likes Blackpool,
Pleasure beach and road stops.
Baby likes the Swiss Alps,
Souvenir gift shops,
Late night,
Midnight radio show talks.
Daddy,
Baby, big jail break.

Ponytail and lollipops.
Dinerettes and soda pops.
New blue bathing suit.
Rouge tops and Cadillacs.
Blue lake car to dunks.
Hopscotch.
Shit talk.
Alabama Hard Knocks.
Motel brass locks.

We're gonna party like it's 1949.
We're in the Pontiac from July to July.
It's a motel flower nation.
Day and night on our last vacation.
We're gonna see it all before he says goodbye.
