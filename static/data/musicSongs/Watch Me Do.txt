Lyrics:


I'm the shhh, be quiet
I've been on a low-hater diet
I'm the shhh, be quiet
I've been on a low-hater diet

Cause I just woke up and I feel some type of way
I get all choked up when I see how much I made
And I feel so good like James Brown in his day
Singing hey, hey, hey

Watch me do, watch me
Watch me do, watch me
Wha-da-do, watch me
Let me hear you sing hey, hey, hey

I ain't saying I'm the besteses
But I got nice curves, nice breasteses
I don't erase the textes from my exeses
All in my DMs, leaving messages
Whoo, head spinning like an exorcist
And I ain't a teacher, but the lesson is
If you wonder how I make it look effortless
The answer to your question is

That I just woke up and I feel some type of way
I get all choked up when I see how much I made
And I feel so good like James Brown in his day
Singing hey, hey, hey

Watch me do, watch me
Watch me do, I said watch me
Wha-da-do, watch me
Let me hear you sing hey, hey, hey

I'm the shhh, be quiet
I've been on a low-hater diet
I'm the shhh, be quiet
I've been on a low-hater diet
I'm the shhh, be quiet
I've been on a low-hater diet
I'm the shhh, be quiet
I've been on a low-hater diet

Cause I just woke up (Good morning!)
And I feel some type of way
I get all choked up when I see how much I made
And I feel so good like James Brown in his day
Singing hey
Come on now, hey
Come on now, hey
Singing, singing, hey

Watch me do, watch me
Watch me do, watch me
Wha-da-do, watch me
Let me hear you sing hey, hey, hey
