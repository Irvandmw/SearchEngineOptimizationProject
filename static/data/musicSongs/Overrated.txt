Lyrics:


Worn out and faded
The weakness starts to show
Theyâve created the generation
That we know
Washed up and hated
The system moves to slow
They give us answers
To questions they donât even know

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

Used up and jaded
Youâre thinking way to slow
So weâre creating
Answers on our own
We canât relate
To what you think you know
And you create
The problems that will never
Go away

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

(Go away, go away, go away, go away)

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
