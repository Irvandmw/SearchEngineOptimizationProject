Lyrics:


Shoulder to shoulder arm in arm
Walkin' on could number nine
So much in love the way we used to be
Once upon a time once upon a time

I'll put that smile back on your face
The one this fool once took away
Each day I'll tell you how much I care
And say the things that I forgot to say

Well we'll be shoulder to shoulder...

I'll bring you love and happiness
And treat your heart so tenderly
Though friends may tell you fools never learn
I hope you'll take another chance on me

So we'll be shoulder to shoulder...

(Shoulder to shoulder arm in arm)
Walkin' on could number nine
So much in love the way we used to be
Once upon a time once upon a time
(Shoulder to shoulder arm in arm)
