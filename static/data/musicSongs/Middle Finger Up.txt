[Intro]
Yeah
And I'm feelin like [x2]

[Verse 1]
And I'm feelin like
What the heck is this, if you say you diss
Imma tell you this, you gon' shoot and miss, imma shoot and hit
Never blow a kiss, all I blow is chips
Takes you off the list, can't co excist, you ain't gon' be missed
Steady stacking chips, lookin' at the wrist, tryin' to see a gliss
You ain't making this, see you getting pissed.
New relationship, bad relationship, no relationship
Guess it's cool for you to say I got a gift.
If you ain't on a team, you ain't on a team.
We gon' be supreme, you can do your thing at the limousine
If you on a team, roll on with the dream-
Tryin' to get ring, you gon' get a ring, you gon' be a king

I aint 16, I ain't 17, tell me what you mean
I'm a grown man, I be getting green
Don't be sipping lean, tell me what you mean
Never moving slow, quickest to the dough, I be getting green
Hand thru the door, hand me some more, gamble it no!
Got a kid that im grabbin' it fo'!
Psych, I aint got a kid, if i ever did, then you know it's his
Have a hundred milli and for i go (?)
Asking me yo, after the show, whats your legacy
Did you really go platinum or gold
Answer them no, can't really show
None of that in heaven, so I never really answer them so
He got upset, he tryin' to get on the internet
Tryin to tell 'em I ain't jammin' no mo'
Can't dance on the floor, brag on the floor
Feelin' like my voice really givin romance to the floor
Sad for the dough, mad for the dough, bad for the dough
??

Faster I go, crash for the dough, 
Now I gotta go, cause I think a couple of fans coming bro..

[Chorus]
I hate you, you hate me
You think I'm living for you, then you must be crazy
My middle finger up, 
Middle finger up [x7]
Money don't make me...
I hate you, you hate me
can't tell me how to live my life because you aint me
My middle finger up, 
Middle finger up [x7]
Fo' those who hate me...

[Verse 2]
This song's for you, if you woke up this morning thinking about what you gonna do to hate on somebody
who tryin' to build a dynasty, a legacy, I hope you see this when you look in the mirror-my 
middle finger up, middle finger up...

What you wanna do, you don't have a clue, you was never true
Meet me any place, you can get eraised, imma break your face, 
Let 'em make a case, let a hater sue
Got a lil' problem with PCD, I never authorized this CD, 
Holla at my lawyer that can't see me, see me in the Aston Martin 
And I'm like beep beep!!
Boys back in school, they was tryin' to talk down
Platinum pot of gold, yeah thats what ya boy found, 
Looking like a fool, tell me how they talk now
Running 'round the town, but I swear the boy clown
How you talk trash when it's you that I fed
Yeah I talk trash cause of you I ain't scared
Tell me that I changed, 'cause I grew ain't got  bread
Sayin' that it's strange, that it's you thats not bled
Down on the ground, clown of the town
Say it to my face, you can find me, imma be around
Wanna play the game, step up to the mound
wanna be a snake, Imma be a shark, Imma see you drown

[Chorus]
I hate you, you hate me
You think im living for you, then you must be crazy
My middle finger up, 
Middle finger up [x7]
(Money dont make me)

I hate you, you hate me
Can't tell me how to live my life because you aint me
my middle finger up, 
middle finger up [x7]
for those who hate me...

Hello to my haters...
