Lyrics:


Yo, yo, yo
I feel it, feel it right here, feel it right here Yo, yo, yo
I feel it right here

Slowly I'm breaking down, feeling weak
I'm thinking about the higher ground I wish to seek
For the safeness, for the realness
Aw, break it down simple
For my people to hear this, for my people
Silent in the dark, I think I'm nutty
With your swords of emotions slashing and leaving me bloody
Now I'm trippin, my problems turn to battles
I'm up shit creek and guess what, without a paddle

Six years of age is when I first got my rage
My father broke out, and then I turned a new page of my life
The change but then I was crazy
And thanks to my mom, cause she has stuck by to raise me
I was fighting all the time, but with God's help
Releasing all my tension through my knockin hand
I'm coming out, I'm a freaked out cat
Coming stony and wet, gonna be picking it up
For the boys who got slack in a band
P-Roach four fingers of a hand, retarded

Shut up and die [x2]

I said you f*cking die
