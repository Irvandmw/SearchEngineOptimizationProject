Lyrics:


Oh, my love, my darling,
I've hungred for your touch, a long, lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much, are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me

My darling,
I've hungred for your touch, a long, lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much, are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me
