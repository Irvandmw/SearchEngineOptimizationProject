Lyrics:


These days, these days, get so hard to breathe
It's hard to move
Steep waves, steep waves, crashing into me
I could swim in the blue

When it comes to my philosophy
I've learned to take it all in my stride
When it comes to darker days
I'm born to race and man I've been doing fine
These days, these days, get so hard to breathe
It's hard to move

So I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been
I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been

Make up for time now
Since I was way back
I'm on a mission and you're starin' at the playback
You call me obsessed
I call you made up
You're trying to stop me honey, please don't quit your day job

When it comes to my philosophy
I've learned to take it all in my stride
When it comes to darker days
I'm born to race and man I've been doing fine
Sunlight is fadin'
No conversatin'
I'm about to pass on through

I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been
I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been
I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been
I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been

When it comes to my philosophy
I've learned to take it all in my stride
When it comes to darker days
I'm born to race and man I've been doing fine
Sunlight is fadin'
No conversatin'
I'm about to pass on through

(When you're born to race, yeah
When you're born to race, yeah
When you're born to race, yeah
Nah nah nah nah nah
When you're born to race, yeah
When you're born to race, yeah
When you're born to race, yeah
Nah nah nah nah nah)

I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been
I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been
I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been
I'm going faster
Faster than I ever been

(When you're born to race, yeah
When you're born to race, yeah
When you're born to race, yeah
Nah nah nah nah nah
When you're born to race, yeah
When you're born to race, yeah
When you're born to race, yeah
Nah nah nah nah nah)
