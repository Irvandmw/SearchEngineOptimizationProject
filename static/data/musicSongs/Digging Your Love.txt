Song Name: Digging Your Love
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


No more lonely talking
waiting for the phone
No more lonely walking
in the streets alone 

Today the sun is shining
cos' since I meet you
the sky seems so blue 

[Chorus:] And I'm digging your love
I'm digging your love
I am forever in your arms
can't get enough
And I go crazy
when you're not here
I wanna follow you my friend
to everywhere
I'm digging your love 

Through a lot of dangers
looking for a life
Meet a lot of strangers
drifting in the night
But now the world is changing
because of that light
that shines in your eyes 

I get lost
I get high
You are taking me to the skies
when you're looking at me
