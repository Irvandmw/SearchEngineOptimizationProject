[Jayway Sosa:]
You already know
Hoo
Hook me up, 4
Ain't no stressing, ain't no stressing, ain't no stressing, ain't no stressing (You already know)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hey
You already know, T.U.G
Ain't no stressing, ain't no stressing, ain't no stressing, ain't no stressing (You already know)

Ain't no more stressin', we on, ain't gotta tell you
Ain't no way I'm gon' stop it, I can't do nothin' but flex
Just look at the crowd I see the watts, but I been ready
Do better under pressure, I know you gon' hate, I ain't sweatin' it
It's like I got a money fetish (Foreign whip, I close the curtains)
It's like I got a money fetish (Like I remember I was hurtin')
It's like I got a money fetish (I might just fuck your hoe on percs)
(His whole life changed in seconds, it's gon' be worth it)

[DaBaby:]
I swear to God it's gon' be worth it
Swear to God that I ain't perfect
Put that on God, I was hurtin'
Stayed on my grind and kept servin'
I don't get tired, I kept workin'
Do this shit for my people, it's all for my family
You ain't got it in you, you won't understand me
My hood so relentless, more hungry than ever
My nuts to the floor, don't know what else to tell ya, damn
Look who cashed out on that foreign
That's Baby Jesus, they hate when that thing pull up on 'em
Threw an extra 10 bands in the motor
I drive that bitch like I don't even want it, ooh
All of my new bitches love me, all of my old bitches hate me
All of 'em exclusive, ain't none of 'em basic
Some of 'em wan' have my baby, I got these hoes goin' crazy
We should all get a rental and go to Miami
Go chill on the beach like we all a big family
We can all get along, I'll take all of y'all shopping
Check in a hotel and we all pop a molly
You kissing on her and she kissing on me
And she licking on her and it's way more than three
You're back to the city, I won't tell her a thing
I'm Baby Jesus, the fuck do you mean?

[Jayway Sosa:]
Ain't no more stressin', we on, ain't gotta tell you
Ain't no way I'm gon' stop it, I can't do nothin' but flex
Just look at the crowd I see the watts, but I been ready
Do better under pressure, I know you gon' hate, I ain't sweatin' it
It's like I got a money fetish (Foreign whip, I close the curtains)
It's like I got a money fetish (Like I remember I was hurtin')
It's like I got a money fetish (I might just fuck your hoe on percs)
(His whole life changed in seconds, it's gon' be worth it)

[?:]
That's why I'm sliding on them leather seats
One thing for certain
I'll make you play like I'm Willy Beam
Ridin' 'til it hurts
Hit that money, call it Quan out loud
It's time to work
And it wasn't even thought of leavin'
It ain't been perfect, nah
We stayed in that trap 'til we ran him up
They labelled us animals
They think that I'd make this far from nothing
Still kept on flexing, fell down I got up
Hakuna matata, your friend is a stallion
Defend to the death of it, money a product
Love [?]
Hop out that TEC, [?]
