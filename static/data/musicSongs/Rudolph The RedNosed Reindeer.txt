Lyrics:


What kind of a name is rudolph
For a reindeer? 
What kind of a name is rudolph
For a reindeer? 
Dear, dear, dear deer!

You know dasher an' dancer,
An' prancer an' vixen,
Comet an' cupid, an' donner an' blitzen,
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all? 

What kind of a name is rudolph
For a reindeer? 

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose,
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.

Then one foggy christmas eve,
Santa came to say:
Rudolph with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? 

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee,
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history.

[instrumental break]

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor rudolph
Play in any reindeer games.

Then one foggy christmas eve,
Santa came to say:
Rudolph with your nose so bright,
Ah! won't you guide my sleigh tonight? 

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee,
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down, down, down, down, down,
In history.
