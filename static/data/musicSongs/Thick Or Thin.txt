Lyrics:


[Justin Bieber:]
Rest assured I'mma be your guardian protecting you
Thick or thin, I'mma be parallel right next to you
Through winter, spring, summer time, I'll fall with you
Take my hand, we'll bring each other up together now
Can't believe God blessed me with an angel just like you

[Poo Bear:]
See my arms, were made to wrap around you
My heart, was made to beat for you
This love was made to adore you in every way
All of my time is made to spend on you
Life, gotta live for you
Wanna post it on a billboard till you know the world is yours
That's for sure

[Justin Bieber:]
Rest assured I'mma be your guardian protecting you
Thick or thin, I'mma be parallel right next to you
Through winter, spring, summer time, I'll fall with you
Take my hand, we'll bring each other up together now
Can't believe God blessed me with an angel just like you
