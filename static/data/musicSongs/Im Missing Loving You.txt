Lyrics:


[Bryan:]
I can figure it out in my head
Nearly time that we put this to bed
It feels like its over
I'm tired and a mess
You forgive me for my big mistake
Then keep throwing it back in my face
We'll both end up lonely
If we cant put this straight

Well I guess it might seem
I don't want you
But I still need you now

[Chorus:]
I love it when you fall asleep at night
Coz I can hear the bell that stops the fight
I know that when the darkness turns to light the fight will take over
I'm missing loving you
Cant stand living with you
But don't wanna live without you
I'm missing loving you

[Mark:]
Well we first started out like a faze
Now its come to its changing ways
Acting so crazy, but sorrys come too late

Seems you started to feel like a fool
Telling all of our friends that were cool
Truth is I'm lonely
Even though your by my side

And I guess we might as well just end this
Coz I don't feel you now

[Chorus]
I love it when you fall asleep at night
Coz I can hear the bell that stops the fight
I know that when the darkness turns to light the fight will take over
I'm missing loving you
Cant stand living with you
But don't wanna live without you
I'm missing loving you

[Shane:]
I think about the future now
Ill stand by you forever

[Mark:]
But baby you just gotta let me know
Hey yeah

[Bryan:]
I love it when you fall asleep at night
Coz I can hear the bell that stops the fight
I know that when the darkness turns to light the fight will take over

[All:]
Cant stand living with you
But don't wanna live without you

[Repeat chorus]
