Lyrics:


Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek then open up the curtain
Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek then open up the curtain
Baby, it's a freakshow

I wanna know
What do you like
What would you say
If I said I
Do anything to you-you
I wanna know
Yeah, it's alright
New position
Bet you would like
You've been screaming
"Stop, yes, please, hun"
Baby I've got tricks in my hat
Craziest chick you've ever had
I heard what you said in your sleep
You wanna win
You wanna mend
I like it rough
I like it bad
I know that deep down you're a freak

Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
Baby, it's a freakshow

Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek then open up the curtain
Baby, it's a freakshow
Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Cause I'm sure by now you're tired of being certain
Baby, it's a freakshow

Baby, it's a freakshow

When you're alone
What do you dream?
I wanna know
Your fantasy
Don't matter how wrong it might be
I'm going insane
Know what it means
Psycho and fun
Sexy and mean
It's just different when you're with me
I want it all
I gotta spell
Put it on you
But I won't tell
Your secret cause I am your slave
You want it hard
You want it tough
I like it long
Never enough
I promise that I won't behave

Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
Baby, it's a freakshow

Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek then open up the curtain
Baby, it's a freakshow
Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Cause I'm sure by now you're tired of being certain
Baby, it's a freakshow

Baby, it's a freakshow

Gimme gimme that
Gimme gimme that, oh
Give you, give you that
Freaky freaky freakshow
Like it like that
Kitty kitty cat, oh
Baby, it's a freakshow
Gimme gimme that
Gimme gimme that, oh
Give you, give you that
Freaky freaky freakshow
Like it like that
Kitty kitty cat, oh
Baby, it's a freakshow

Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
(You can't ignore)
Wanna take a peek then open up the curtain...
Baby, it's a freakshow
Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
(Baby, it's a freakshow!)
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek then open up the curtain
Baby, it's a freakshow
Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Cause I'm sure by now you're tired of being certain
Baby, it's a freakshow

Baby, it's a freakshow, show, show, show, show, show, show, show, show, show
Baby, it's a freakshow, show, show, show, show...
