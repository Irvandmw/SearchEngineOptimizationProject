Lyrics:


You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us
Another start
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary
Where are you now?

Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me

I'm faded
I'm faded
I'm faded
I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded
