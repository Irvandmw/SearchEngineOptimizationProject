Lyrics:


Where do you come from barefoot boy
Where might you be going

I'm just a barefoot boy and I sing from town to town
I'm just a barefoot boy with my
Head in the sky and my feet on the ground
Hear my voice and you look all around
For the barefoot boy

Where no shoes, got nothin' to lose
And I leave my blues behind me
Don't look for me, 'cause I just won't be
Wherever you thought you'd find me

I'm just a barefoot boy and I sing from town to town
I'm just a barefoot boy with my
Head in the sky and my feet on the ground
Hear my voice and you look all around
For the barefoot boy

Free as the wind, I'm a wanderin'
And no one can confine me
I just can't stay, gotta go today
And trouble will stay behind me

I'm just a barefoot boy and I sing from town to town
I'm just a barefoot boy with my
Head in the sky and my feet on the ground
Hear my voice and you look all around
For the barefoot boy
Barefoot boy

Night is over, comes the dawn
barefoot boy here and gone

I'm just a barefoot boy
I'm just a barefoot boy
I'm just a barefoot boy
I'm just a barefoot boy
I'm just a barefoot boy
