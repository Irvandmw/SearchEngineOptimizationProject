Lyrics:


Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
Iâm a bad influence, thatâll do
âCos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just donât talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, donât be slow
Thisâll only take a moâ
Take yourself right out of my door

Itâs just that they donât care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just donât reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And donât give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girlâs trouble

Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
âCos youâre a bad influence, thatâll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just donât talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, donât be slow
Thisâll only take a moâ
Take yourself right out of my door

Itâs just that they donât care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just donât reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And donât give in to lust
And leave that one alone

This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as youâre a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you donât see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2D
The only thing thatâs free in life is love
And that donât come cheap

Itâs just that they donât care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just donât reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And donât give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girlâs trouble
