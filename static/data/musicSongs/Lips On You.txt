Lyrics:


[Adam Levine & Matt Flynn:]
Keep me connected, to you
Like I was your shadow
You're givin' me answers
To all of my questions
Here on my pillow, oh
Can't nothing get in between us, baby
We've been waiting on this moment for so long
You wanna be reckless, restless
Right until tomorrow
Wait

[Adam Levine & Charlie Puth:]
When I put my lips on you
I feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

[Adam Levine & Matt Flynn:]
Just turn off the lights
And you could be my private dancer
When we close the curtains
You and me can forget all our manners
The neighbors must think we're crazy, baby
Cause look how easily we keep coming undone
You wanna be reckless, restless
Right until tomorrow
Wait

[Adam Levine & Charlie Puth:]
When I put my lips on you
I feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

When I put my lips on you
I feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
