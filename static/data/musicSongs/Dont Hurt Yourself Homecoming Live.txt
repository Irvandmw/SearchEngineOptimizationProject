Lyrics:


Who the fuck do you think I is?
You ain't married to no average bitch, boy
You can watch my fat ass twist, boy
As I bounce to the next dick, boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Keep a bigger smile on my face being alone
Bad motherfucker, God complex
I motivate your ass, call me Malcolm X
Yo operator, or innovator
Fuck you hater, you can't recreate her, no
You'll never recreate her no, hell no

You just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby
You just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, babe

When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
Try not to hurt yourself
When you play me, you play yourself
Don't play yourself
When you lie to me, you lie to yourself
You only lying to yourself (Don't hurt yourself)

You just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby
Hey baby, who the fuck do you think I is?
I smell that fragrance on your Louis knit, boy
Just give my fat ass a big kiss, boy
Tonight I'm fucking up all your shit, boy

"The most disrespected person in America
Is the Black woman"
I am the dragon breathing fire
"The most un-protected person in America
Is the Black woman"
Beautiful mane, I'm the lion
"The most neglected person in America
Is the Black woman"
Beautiful man, I know you're lying

This is your final warning
You know I give you life
If you try this shit again
You gon' lose your wife
