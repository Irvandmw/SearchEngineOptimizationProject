Lyrics:


Boy we made it to the top
We went so high we couldn't stop
We climbed the ladder leading us nowhere
Two of us together
Building castles in the air
We spun so fast we couldn't tell
The gold ring from the carrousel
How could we know
The ride would turn out bad
Everything we wanted
Was everything we had

I miss the hungry years
The once upon a time
The lovely long ago
We didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you
We lost along the way
How could I be so blind
Not to see the door
Closing on the world
I now hunger for
Looking through my tears
I miss the hungry years

We shared our daydreams one by one
Making plans was so much fun
We set our goals
And reached the highest star
Things that we were after
Were much better from afar
And here we stand
Just me and you
With everything and nothing too
It wasn't worth the price
We had to pay
Baby take me home
Let's go back to yesterday

I miss the hungry years
The once upon a time
The lovely long ago
We didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you
We lost along the way
How could I be so blind
Not to see the door
Closing on the world
I now hunger for
Looking through my tears
I miss the hungry years
I miss the hungry years
