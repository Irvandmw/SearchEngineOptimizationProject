Lyrics:


Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me.
Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me.

When I think back, your love was like the sun
And I don't remember no dark days, remember the warm warm fun.

Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me.
Fools in life, mmmm woman than a happy fool I'd rather be.

Oh baby I'll be glad to learn from you,
Darlin' I know you will be glad to learn from me.
And if we get down and things get sad, 
We can cheer up eachother, and grin cuz things just ain't that bad.
If we fools in life, a happy fool I would rather be.

Day by day, just one step, one step at a time.
Cuz woman you have given me so much,
Just to ease this stubborn little achin' heart of mine.

I don't care where they came from,
and I don't care what they might say,
Woman you've been lovin' in my corner, all, all the way.
Day by day, that's the magical kind cuz it's flowin' all of the time.

Further on down the road, baby,
you will accompany me 
Further on down the road, baby,
you will accompany me 

When I look back,
your love was like the sun,
And I don't remember any cold days,
I just remember the warm warm fun.

Further on down the road, baby,
you will accompany me.

Ohhhh Babe, ohhhh babe, ohhhh darling
ohhhh babe, ohhhh darling, ohhhh babe, 
ohhhh babe, ohhhh darling, ohhhh babe, 
ohhhh babe, ohhhh babe, ohhhh darling...
