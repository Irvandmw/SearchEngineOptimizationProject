Lyrics:


You played the part of this hard to get
And somehow you knew that I couldn't forget
And though I don't think in terms of two
I got it bad for you
And when you passed me along the way
I couldn't speak, so you didn't stay
And though I don't think in terms of two
You're breaking my heart
Shaking me up the part
Breaking my heart
Shaking me up the part again
When it appeared to me I was found
And nothing I did could bring me around
And though I don't think in terms of two
I saw it there in you
So now if you'd only understand
That without you here
I'd be half of a man
And though I don't think in terms of two
You're breaking my heart
Shakin me off the part
Breaking my heart
Shakin me off the part again
Because of you
Because of me
The times are right
I disagree
Before you leave
I want you to see
Woah, what you've done to me
