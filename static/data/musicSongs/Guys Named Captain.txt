Lyrics:


Guys named Captain are, always characters
Livin' by the water, somewhere in the Americas
South or Central, or some Virgin Island
Barefoot and sun-kissed, always smilin'

Guys named Captain aren't haters, they're lovers
Livin' life large, but largely undercover
Dive bars and cocktails, waitresses and totems
Chasin' the sun, run aground a fossil like

Captain Outrageous, and Captain Tony
I paint around a sailor, hope he was cronys
Floatin' on the breeze, the salt of the sea
Henry, tattooed and laughin'
Guys named Captain

Casanovas and entrepreneurs
Full of bravado, that's half the allure
The wink of the eye, a shadow we past
Lifelines from blowin' smoke up your glass

Like Captain Bligh, Captain Kidd
Mutiny on the bounty, loose cannons in the wind
Buccaneers, with nothing to fear
Who go down with the ship, last man standin'
Guys named Captain

Guys named Captain have, sons and daughters
Flesh and blood, like my father
Captain Vick, who played the mandolin
And when they're gone, man you miss them
Guys named Captain

Guys named Captain
