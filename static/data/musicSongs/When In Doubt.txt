Lyrics:


We sat upon your bed, 
You said the things you said
And I could not believe that you seem so naive
We exchanged our poetry, 
You seem to think a lot like me
I'll guess I'll just assume that we could talk about most anything 

Then I asked have you ever felt abandoned? 
Felt so lost that you were stranded,
Just like all the walls are closing in 
And you were left inside 
Have you ever felt like your days were numbered? 
Stuck under a tree in thunder 
Seems to be no way out! 
But there is One when in doubt

Ready for another day
Slowly watch ya waste away, 
Havin' fun, bein' cool
Like we did in high school,
Elementary romance feelin' nervous at the dance, 
Crack a smile hold it down, 
Whatever the circumstance, 
Sex, Drugs, Hadda be cool, 
All the things we learned in school, 
Typical teenage machines, 
Anyone tell me what this means? 
I could learn, I could try, 
Never really had an alibi 
Wish I did, that's no lie 
Everybody's asking

[chorus]
Why?
When you feel like you cant fly
You gotta know I got the answer for ya baby, 
Drives ya crazy, it's not over 
Theres so much more to life then this
Why?
When you feel like you cant fly 
You gotta know I got the answer for ya baby, 
Drives ya crazy it's not over 
Theres so much more to life then this 

Things seem so hallucinary, 
In the corners of my mind they scare me, 
I know ya never meant to desert me, 
Just like ya never really meant to hurt me 

Then I ask have you ever felt abandoned? 
Felt so lost that you were stranded,
Just like all the walls are closing in 
And you were left inside 
Have you ever felt like your days were numbered? 
Stuck under a tree in thunder 
Seems to be no way out
But there is One when in doubt

And you ask
[chorus]

So much more to life than this
