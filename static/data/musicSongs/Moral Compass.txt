Lyrics:


Here we go, one more round
Of an argument you can't lose
And I can't win
And I have to say if I step back
Your points seem stronger than mine yet again
But you hold your truth self-evident
And think that's the wrong place to begin

Elevating principles
To a place where they seem divine

But your moral compass is
Your moral compass is
Your moral compass is not mine

See all those soul
Doing the bad things
Things you believe
You would never do
Well maybe you're right
Or maybe you're just lucky
You haven't lived through
What they've lived through

You have a set of rules
To see you to the grave
Well, that's fine

But your moral compass is
Your moral compass is
Your moral compass is not mine
