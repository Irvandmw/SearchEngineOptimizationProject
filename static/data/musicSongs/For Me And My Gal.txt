Lyrics:


The bells are ringin', for me an' my gal, 
The birds are singin' for me an' my gal, 
Everybody's been knowin', to a weddin' they're goin' 
An' for weeks they've been sewin' every Susie and Sal'... 

They're congregatin' (ding, dong, ding, dong,) 
For me an' my gal (ding, dong, ding, dong,) 
The Parson's waitin' (ding, dong, ding, dong,) 
For me and my gal (ding, dong, ding, dong,) 
An' someday I'm gonna build a little home for two, 
Or three or four, or more, 
In Loveland, for me an' my gal... 

See the relatives there, lookin' over the pair, 
They can tell at a glance, it's a loving romance, 
It's a wonderful sight, as the families unite, 
See it makes the boy proud, as he says to the crowd... 

The bells are ringin', for me an' my gal, 
The birds are singin' for me an' my gal, 
Everyone's been knowin' (all our friends and our relations!) 
To a weddin' they're goin' (will be at the railroad station!) 
An' for weeks they've been sewin' (or, they'll send congratulations!) 
Every Susie and Sal' (...for me an' my gal!) 

They're congregatin' for me an' my gal, 
The Parson's waitin' for me and my gal, 
An' someday I'm gonna build a little home for two, 
(Or three or four,) or more, (or more!) 
In Loveland! (Loveland!) 
In Loveland! (Loveland!) 
In Loveland, for me an' my gal!
