Lyrics:


Come get it
Ughh

This is war, I spotted 9, maybe 10
Mightâve missed one by the door
The grass is high where we roar
Sometimes a rebel doesnât make an outlaw

I can see them in the distance
âCause anything can happen in an instant
But now we know why weâre here
Nobodyâs safe, get out the clear

You shouldnât have done it
Now thereâs blood in the water
You canât stop this thing weâve started
Word of mouth, thereâs a snake in the garden
You canât stop this thing weâve started

Come get it, forget it, even if you wanted
You canât stop this thing weâve started
Bring it on, like a bomb, even if you wanted
You canât stop this thing weâve started

This is war, and when it rains it pours
So get ready for the encore
Tensionâs high in the blast off
Shake up the board room, take all the masks off

Cataclysmic, down to business
Thereâs no fear here, no time for head tricks
âCause now we know why weâre here
Nobodyâs safe, get out the clear

You shouldnât have done it
Now thereâs blood in the water
You canât stop this thing weâve started
Word of mouth, thereâs a snake in the garden
You canât stop this thing weâve started

Come get it, forget it, even if you wanted
You canât stop this thing weâve started
Bring it on, like a bomb, even if you wanted
You canât stop this thing weâve started

You canât knock it, canât rock it
You canât stop this thing we started
You canât stop it, just get off it
You canât stop this thing we started

You canât knock it, canât rock it
You canât stop this thing we started
You canât stop it, just get off it
You canât stop this thing we started

You canât knock it, canât rock it
You canât stop this thing we started
You canât stop it, just get off it
You canât stop this thing we started

Come get it, forget it, even if you wanted
You canât stop this thing weâve started
Bring it on, like a bomb, even if you wanted
You canât stop this thing weâve started
