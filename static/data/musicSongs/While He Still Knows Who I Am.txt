Lyrics:


Drive a Chevy cuz he drove Chevys,
Like him I'm a baseball fan.
I'm going back to see him
While he still knows
Who I am.

Mama says he can't remember.
Daddy thinks he still can.
I'm going back to see him
While he still knows
Who I am.

This time I'm gonna hug him
Instead of just shaking hands.
Gonna tell him that I love him
While he still knows
Who I am.

I only knew him as my father,
I'm gonna get to know the man.
I'm going back to see him
While he still knows
Who I am.

This time I'm gonna kiss him
Instead of just shaking hands.
Gonna tell him that I love him
While he still knows
Who I am.
