Lyrics:


You know you won my heart baby right at the start
And I was such a fool for you
I used to believe that you cared for me
By all the little things you do

But I've gotten wise to your disguise
And all of your sweet talk too
So listen to me honey and here what I say
'Cause I'm all through with you

I should've left my heart at home
When I went out with you
If I'd been smart baby I would've known
That you'd take it and break it in two

You know I've got a hunch, and I'll bet a bunch
That you'll be kinda lonely too
And you'll sit around and you'll wonder why
I never come to call on you

And one of these days, baby, you'll change your ways
When all of your dreams turn blue
But right now baby you better believe
I'm all through with you

I should've left my heart at home
When I went out with you
If I'd been smart baby I would've known
That you'd take it and break it in two

I've got a hunch, and baby I'll bet a bunch
That you'll be kinda lonely too
And you'll sit around and you'll wonder why
I never come to call on you

And one of these days, baby, you'll change your ways
When all of your dreams turn blue
But right now baby you better believe
I'm all through with you
I'm all through with you
I'm all through with you
