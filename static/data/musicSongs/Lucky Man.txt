Lyrics:


(It's just a change)
(It's just a change)
(It's just a change)
(It's just a change)
(It's just a change)
(It's just a change)
(It's just a change)

Happiness more or less
It's just a change me something in my levity
Oh my my

Happiness coming and going
I watch you look at me watch my fever growing, I know
Just where I am

Well, how many corners do I have to turn
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind

But I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hands

Happiness something in my own place
I'm stood here naked smiling I feel no disgrace
With who I am

Happiness coming and going
I watch you look at me watch my fever growing, I know
Just who I am

How many corners do I have to turn
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind
I hope you understand
I hope you understand

I gotta love that never dies, oh love
I gotta love that never dies, oh yeah

I'm a lucky man, yeah
I'm a lucky man
(It's just a change me something in my levity)
I'm a lucky man
(It's just a change me something in my levity)
I'm a lucky man

Oh my my
Oh my my
Oh my my
