Lyrics:


What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those day for taking a walk outside
I'm blowin' the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face in somebody's new mowed lawn

I've been having a sweet dream
I've been dreaming since I woke up today
It started me in my sweet dream
And she's the one make me feel this way

Even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load
A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad

And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
A daydream will last along end of the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years

What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy
