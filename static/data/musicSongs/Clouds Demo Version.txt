Lyrics:


My callused hands
My crippled wings
My callused hands, my crippled wings; they bring you in

I've been taught if I would just open my
Hands up to the sky, they'll turn to clouds
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Your crowded hair
Falls down a narrow hallway

Oh, just forget it, just forget it and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh, surprise
Come on, let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move
Oh, just forget it, just forget it and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh, surprise
Come on, let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move

Your scribbled masterpiece
And written poetry

Cause I've been taught if I would just open my
Hands up to the sky, they'll turn to clouds
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa
A sky of hands that rain down heavy on us

Oh, just forget it, just forget it and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh, surprise
Come on, let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move
Oh, just forget it, just forget it and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh, surprise
Come on, let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move

Come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in from the back door
Drift along the flooded sea of muddy water
Clouds above us crying
Tears of sins, all dying
Begging for a reason
This year seems like a season
Belief in what we're living
A story with no ending
The storm is beating down

Come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in from the back door
Drift along the flooded sea of muddy water
Clouds above us crying
Tears of sins, all dying
I'm begging for a reason
This year seems like a season
Belief in what we're living
A story with no ending
The storm is beating down
We're sinking to the sky
Sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
Sinking to the sky
