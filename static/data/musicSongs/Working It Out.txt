Lyrics:


I've been waiting for the sky to fall
For so long, for so long
I admit that before I know it all,
I've been wrong, so wrong

I've worn so many faces
All the colors I've been when I'm with you
I wish I could switch places
With the one that you give your heart to

I'm still working it out
What I'm doing without
You I'm lost, that's what I've found
I'm hopeless and I need you now
Had my head in the clouds
My dreams watered down
It's not until you're not around
That I know that I need you now
[x2]

I've been waiting for a miracle
Since I was young, since I was young
What I had I didn't recognize
Till it's gone, till it's gone

I've worn so many faces
All the colors I've been when I'm with you
I wish I could switch places
With the one that you give your heart to

I'm still working it out
What I'm doing without
You I'm lost, that's what I've found
I'm hopeless and I need you now
Had my head in the clouds
My dreams watered down
It's not until you're not around
That I know that I need you now
[x2]

I've worn so many faces
All the colors I've been when I'm with you
I tried to fill the spaces
All the pieces still don't add up to you

I'm still working it out
What I'm doing without
You I'm lost, that's what I've found
I'm hopeless and I need you now
Had my head in the clouds
My dreams watered down
It's not until you're not around
That I know that I need you now
[x2]

I'm still working it out
I'm still working it out
I'm still working it out
I'm still working it out
Ooh, I'm still working it out.
