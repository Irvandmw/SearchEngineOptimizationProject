Song Name: Since You Said Goodbye
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Rain keeps fallin' on my head
Sun keeps burnin' out my eyes
Lord the moon he knows I'm blue
And it's all because of you

Ever since you said goodbye
Black cloud hangin' over me
I can't seem to do it right
Lord the wind it never blows
The river never flows

Ever since you said goodbye
Sunny days have come and gone
Heaven knows I'm here cryin'
Lord the moon he knows I'm blue
And it's all because of you
Ever since you said goodbye
