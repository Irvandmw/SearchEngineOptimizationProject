Lyrics:


Let's keep it moving in a forward motion,
If we can hold on, we can cross this ocean,
There's no sense in lettin' our emotions,
Get in the way, until the door keeps closin'

If we sort this out, would we know how,
To live like we were different,
I know we've both had some doubts,
whether things would come around,
And look at us now

I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life...

Let's keep it moving in a forward motion,
If we can hold on, we can cross this ocean,
There's no sense in lettin' our emotions,
Get in the way, until the door keeps closin'

I never thought, we'd doubt,
Whether this world would come,
Around, and work itself out
But it's more than a sound,
If it moves everyone around,
Are you ready now?
And I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life

Let's keep it moving in a forward motion,
If we can hold on, we can cross this ocean,
There's no sense in lettin' our emotions,
Get in the way, until the door keeps closin'

I won't, be afraid, Your hands they cover me,
It's so worth it, 'cause it's worth it?
I can't let it fade
My hands are high and, raised,
'Cause it's worth it

I'm not trying to tell you [x3]
how to live your life...

Let's keep it moving in a forward motion,
If we can hold on, we can cross this ocean,
There's no sense in lettin' our emotions,
Get in the way, until the door keeps closin'
