Lyrics:


Lucky star shine on me
Lucky star don't you see
I need your light shinin' bright
To win her love for me tonight

Lucky star in the sky
Don't let her love pass me by
No matter how near or far
Won't you be my lucky star

Oo, oo, oo, I'm wishin' on you
Oo, oo, oo, I promise I'll be true

Lucky star up above
Please help me win her love
Tell me what my chances are
Won't you be my lucky star

Oo, oo, oo, I'm wishin' on you
Oo, oo, oo, I promise I'll be true

Lucky star up above
Please help me win her love
Tell me what my chances are
Won't you be my lucky star
Won't you be my lucky star
