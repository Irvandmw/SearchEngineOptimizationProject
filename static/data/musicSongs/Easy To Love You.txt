Lyrics:


Uncomplicated, you enjoy the simple things
Donât need no make-up you just wear what nature brings
If you could see what I see you would know youâre beautiful

You make it easy to love you every time you smile at me
And itâs so easy to love you girl you shine so naturally
I couldnât even count them thereâs so many ways
You make it easy to love you

You canât hide it, itâs there in everything you do
You donât see it, and thatâs just why I fell for you
If you could see what I see you would know youâre beautiful

You make it easy to love you every time you smile at me
And itâs so easy to love you girl you shine so naturally
I couldnât even count them thereâs so many ways
You make it easy to love you

You make it easy to love you
If you could see what I see you would know youâre beautiful

You make it easy to love you every time you smile at me
And itâs so easy to love you girl you shine so naturally
I couldnât even count them thereâs so many ways
You make it easy to love you
