Lyrics:


Long ago there was a man
Changed stone to bread with one touch of his hand
He made the blind see and the dumb understand
He died for the tears in your eyes, your eyes
Many people came from all around
To hear this man preach with glorious sound
He spoke of man in harmony and love abound
He died for the tears in your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
He died for the tears in your eyes

For the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
Four cents may be all that they're worth
For the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth, the earth

Faith is a word we all should try
Describing the man who willingly died
Believe that your hunger, sorrow, and fears
Is less than the tears in your eyes, your eyes

Less than the tears in your eyes
For the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
Four cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
For the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth (Say it again)

For the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
Four cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
For the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth, the earth

Thank you
