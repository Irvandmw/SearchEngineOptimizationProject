Lyrics:


(Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself)

Babygirl, don't give up yet
Practice patience, hold your breath

One day you'll be so in love
This is not your curtain call
One day you gon' have it all
I said one day you gon' have it all

As soon as you love yourself (love yourself)
You never know what an angel you are
Stop breaking your heart
As soon as you love yourself (love yourself)
You gotta try before anyone can
You'll understand
Soon as you

(Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself)

Babygirl, I know it's hard
Tryin' to quiet all your thoughts

One day they'll leave you alone
You'll feel better when you grown
One day you gon' take your throne
Baby, go ahead and take your throne

As soon as you love yourself (love yourself)
You never know what an angel you are
Stop breaking your heart
As soon as you love yourself (love yourself)
You gotta try before anyone can
You'll understand
As soon as you

(Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself
Love yourself, love, love yourself)
