Lyrics:


I never couldâve seen this far
I never couldâve seen this coming
Seems like my worldâs falling apart

Yeah

Why is everything so hard
I donât think I can deal with the things you said
It just wonât go away

In a perfect world
This could never happen
In a perfect world
Youâd still be here
And it makes no sense
I could just pick up the pieces
But to you
This means nothing
Nothing at all

I used to think that I was strong
Until the day it all went wrong
I think I need a miracle to make it through

Yeah

I wish that I could bring you back
I wish that I could turn back time
Cuz I canât let go
I just canât find my way
Yeah
Without you I just canât find my way

In a perfect world
This could never happen
In a perfect world
Youâd still be here
And it makes no sense
I could just pick up the pieces
But to you
This means nothing
Nothing at all

I donât know what I should do now
I donât know where I should go
Iâm still here waiting for you
Iâm lost when youâre not around
I need to hold on to you
I just canât let you go

Yeah
Yeah

In a perfect world
This could never happen
In a perfect world
Youâd still be here
And it makes no sense
I could just pick up the pieces
But to you
This means nothing
Nothing at all
You feel nothing, nothing at all
Nothing at all
