People 
People 
People 
People 
People try to put us down (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
Just because we get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
Things they do look awful cold (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
I hope I don't die before I get old (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 

My generation 
My generation, baby 

Why don't you all fade away (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
And don't try to dig what we all ssay (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
I'm not trying to cause a big ssensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 

My generation 
My generation, baby 
My generation 

Why don't you all fade away (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
And don't try to dig what we all say (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
I'm not trying to cause a b-big sensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 

My generation 
My generation, baby 
MY Generation 
My Generation, baby 

People try to put us down (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
Just because we get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
Things they do look awful cold (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 
I hope I don't die before I get old (Talkin' 'bout my generation) 

My generation 
My generation, baby 
My generation 
My generation, baby 
My generation 
My generation, baby 
My generation 
My generation, baby 

People try to put us down
