Lyrics:


One minute to one
And you gottta go home
And I didn't even kiss ya
While we were alone
I was sittin' there wishin'
I could hold you tight
But I reckon I waited just a little to long to
Kiss you tonight

One minute to one
How did it get so late
Even though I didn't get to kiss you
Well it's really been a wonderful date

One minute to one
And the movie was great
But your mamma's gonna worry
'Cause it's gettin' so late
I just wanted to tell ya
That I love you so
But I reckon I waited just a little to long so
We'd better go

One minute to one
How did it get so late
Even though I didn't get to kiss you
Well it's really been a wonderful date

Now I want you to know now
That I think you're nice
But I reckon I'll wait 'till tomorrow night and
I'll kiss you twice
