Lyrics:


Hey sinner, you better hear what I'm saying
Sinner, you been a swinging and not praying
One day of praying and six nights of fun
The odds of going to heaven, six to one

You walk on the wild side
The devil is waiting, he's waiting to take your hand
You walk on the wild side
You're walking with Satan, walking on the Promise Land
One day of praying and six nights of fun
The odds against going to heaven, six to one

You better cross over, you better walk humble
Or you're gonna stumble, and Satan is waiting to take your hand

You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
Away from the Promise Land
One day of praying and six nights of fun
Makes he odds against going to heaven six to one

You better cross over, you better walk humble
Or you're gonna stumble, and Satan is waiting to take your hand

You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
