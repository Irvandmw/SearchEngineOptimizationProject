Lyrics:


I might get ugly, if nobody loves me anymore
I might keep it simple, to find out what you're here for
Just let me know
I know I'm quiet. I go back there every time you leave me crying
Out to the sky. You can tell me why
Love could be alive, if your love is not a lie, woah

(But you can't make me hush. You know I'm all about the rush)

No one's gonna save you from yourself
And I hope that you feel better
Better
I hope that you feel good
And no one's gonna want you if you cry for help
And I'm there now
I care now
I'm there now
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Hush

If you can trust me, you just might be lucky in a thousand ways
Nigga, wassup wassup. You fucked up
I don't hate, I just tough love, tough love
You think that you know, but you're out of control
I'm the ticking bomb and the detonator froze
And now you're exposed. Exposed. Explode. Explode. Explode. Explode

No one's gonna save you from yourself
And I hope that you feel better
Better. Better
And no one's gonna want you if you cry for help
And I'm there now. I'm there now. I'm there now.
No one's gonna save you from yourself
And I hope that you feel better. Better. Better.
And no one's gonna want you if you cry for help
(save you from yourself)

And I'm there now. I'm there now. I'm there now.
