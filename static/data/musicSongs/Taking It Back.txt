Lyrics:


Iâve been away so long, I knew the place
Itâs been too long since Iâve been around
Just like I rolling stone, I ainât got no home
But my boys are back in town, kick it

Itâs been two long years that Iâve been on the run
From lawyers, lovers, monies and a lawmanâs son
You thought it was the last you heard from me
Well, you better back up to catch up with me

âCause Iâm livinâ in the fast lane
Speeding like a steam train
Just before I fall, just before I fall off the track

Taking it back
Iâm taking it back

Taking it back
You took it away, took it away
All I can say is weâre taking it back

Iâm the same old dog that I used to be
The wordâs all over town that youâve been looking for me
Iâm no different that I was before
Give you what you need and then Iâm out the door

âCause Iâm livinâ in the fast lane
Coming like a hurricane
A snake without a rattle, baby
Thatâs a matter of fact, yeah

Taking it back
Taking it back

Taking it back
You took it away, took it away
All I can say is weâre taking it back

Iâve been away so long, itâs good to see your face
Barkeep, wonât you buy me a round?
Raise a glass to the good times past
Then weâll tear this damn place down

Taking it back
Taking it back

Taking it back
Taking it back

Taking it back, Lord
Taking it back, all right

Taking it back
Taking it back
