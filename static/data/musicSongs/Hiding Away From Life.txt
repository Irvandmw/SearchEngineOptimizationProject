Lyrics:


I am not quite myself
I look like somebody else
In the mirror there on the wall
Nothing in common with the person at all

It's time to catch your tears
And face the things I fear
In the world and soften the burns
Focusing on not losing you girl

Maybe I am just a dreamer
Hiding away from life
Maybe we are just pretending
It never cuts like a knife

You are one step ahead
Like when we first met
Nothing is true of what I said to you
I love you forever and you know that too

Maybe I am just a dreamer
Hiding away from life
Maybe we are just pretending
It never cuts like a knife

Just playing around with words
And I didn't mean to hurt
Just trying to find myself again

Maybe I am just a dreamer
Hiding away from life
Maybe we are just pretending
It never cuts like a knife
