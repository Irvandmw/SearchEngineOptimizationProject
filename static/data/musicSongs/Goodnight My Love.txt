Lyrics:


Goodnight, my love (wah-ooh) 
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love 
May tomorrow be sunny and bright 
And bring you closer to me 

Before you go (wah-ooh) 
There's just one thing I'd like to know (wah-ooh) 
If you love is still warm for me 
Or has it gone cold? 

If you should awake in the still of the night 
Please have no fear 
For I'll be there, darling you know I care 
Please give your love to me, dear, only 

Goodnight, my love (wah-ooh) 
Pleasant dreams and sleep, sleep tight, my love (wah-ooh) 
May tomorrow be sunny and bright 

And bring you closer to me 

Goodnight, my love 
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love 
May tomorrow be sunny and bright 
And bring you closer to me 

(wah-ooh, wah-ooh) 
Goodnight, my love 
(wah-ooh, wah-ooh) 
Goodnight, my love 
(wah-ooh, wah-ooh) 
Goodnight, my love 
(wah-ooh, wah-ooh) 
Sleep tight, my love
