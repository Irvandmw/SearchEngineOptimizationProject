Lyrics:


Iâm on the rebound
I get it when I want to
Iâm on the way down
Iâm getting fixed without you
You gave me a band aid
I put it on my heartbreak
And all you got is pictures in your hand

Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldnât control
I walked away from you (I walked away from you)
Don't you wish you could hold? 
The pretty little paper doll
The one you couldnât quite control
I walked away from you

Flip to me Iâm the centerfold
Iâm gonna charm you all night (all night)
Stick to me Iâm the centerfold
Weâre gonna go on, hold tight

Iâm gonna hate you
âTil I forget you
So hereâs a keep sake
I left it in the bathroom
Just a little something
Something to remind you
Iâm sure youâll never get this close again

Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldnât control
I walked away from you (I walked away from you)
Don't you wish you could hold 
The pretty little paper doll
The one you couldnât quite control
I walked away from you (I walked away from you)

Flip to me Iâm the centerfold
Iâm gonna charm you all night (all night)
Stick to me Iâm the centerfold
Weâre gonna go on, hold tight (hold tight)
Flip to me Iâm the centerfold
Iâm gonna charm you all night (all night)
Stick to me Iâm the centerfold
Weâre gonna go on, hold tight

Now its him when it coulda been you
Tell me why itâs him when it shoulda been you
Its crazy how this makes you wanna change
Hereâs an image you wonât forget
All your life Iâll tease, Iâll torment
Iâll be gone as soon as you turn the page

Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldnât control
I walked away from you (yeah) 
Don't you wish you could hold 
The pretty little paper doll
The one you couldnât quite control
I walked away from you (oh, walked away from you)

Flip to me Iâm the centerfold
Iâm gonna charm you all night (all night)
Stick to me Iâm the centerfold
Weâre gonna go on, hold tight
