Lyrics:


I remember when we used to be in our teens
I wear bobby socks and old blue jeans
That was long ago I'd like to say
I love you in the same old way, aha ha
I love you in the same old way

Hmm, I remember when we used to babysit your brother
And who was watching us? Your father and mother
That was long ago and I'd like to say
I love you in the same old way, aha ha
I love you in the same old way

Now, Heaven I'm in Heaven again
And I still remember where and when
And I love you, you still love me
And that's the way its gonna be

I remember when we were in school
A learning how to live by the golden rule
That was long ago and I'd like to say
I love you in the same old way, aha
I love you in the same old way
Ho!

Hmm, heaven I'm in heaven again
And I still remember where and when
I still love you, you know you love me
And that's the way its gonna be

Hey, I remember when we used to be in school
A learning how to live by the golden rule
That was long ago and I'd like to say
I love you in the same old way, aha
I love you in the same old way, aha
I love you in the same old way, aha
