Lyrics:


Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Don't play that song for me
It brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you

Oh no, don't let it play
It fills my heart with pain
Please stop it right away
I remember just what it said

It said, ("Darling, I love you") You know that you lied
("Darling, I love you") You know that you lied
("Darling, I love you") You know that you lied
(Hoo) You lied (hoo) You lied, lied, lied, lied

Remember on our first date?
You kissed me and you walked away
You were only seventeen
I never thought you'd act so mean

But baby, you told me you loved me
You told me you cared
You said, "I'll go with you darlin'
Almost anywhere." but baby you know that

("Darling, I love you") You know that you lied
("Darling, I love you") You know that you lied
("Darling, I love you") You know that you lied
(Hoo) You lied (hoo) You lied, lied, lied, lied

Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
Stop it baby
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Don't play it no more
Baby please, don't play it baby
Don't play it no more
No, no, no, no, no, no, stop it, baby

("Darling, I love you") You know that you lied
("Darling, I love you") You know that you lied
("Darling, I love you") Yes baby, you lied
