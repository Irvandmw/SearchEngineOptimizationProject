Lyrics:


All the feelings I got inside
Nobody knows what's wrong
To me and another
All the feelings I got inside
Nobody knows what's wrong
To me and another

Every time I look away
There are all the things I might never say
Everything I do is wrong
But I always sing my song
Yeah I always sing my song 
In my own way

Cause if we shadows
All the things we say we are
If we shadows
To move in time with the things we find
In the shadows
We're just going round
And I might not feel this way for long

There are things calling my mind
Nobody knows what's wrong
To me and my brother
Many things are calling inside
Nobody knows how long
To me and my brother

And everything I say to you
But I don't care why you do what you do
And everything that are wrong
Nobody knows what's wrong
Nobody knows what's wrong
Till we find a way

Cause if we shadows
All the things we say we are
If we shadows
To move in time with the things we find
In the shadows
Our lives just going round
And I feel no shame at all
No I feel no shame at all
