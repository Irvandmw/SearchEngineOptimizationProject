You need coolin', honey, I'm not fooling
I'm gonna send ya back to schoolin'
Way down inside, honey, you need it
I wanna give you my love

You've been learnin', oh honey, I've been burnin'
All those good times baby, baby, I've been yearnin'
Oh way down inside, honey you need it
Wanna give you my love
Gonna give you my love

You've been coolin', well honey, I've been droolin'
All those good times, baby, baby, I've been misusin'
Oh way down inside, honey you need it
Wanna give you my love
Gonna give you my love
Hey

I wanna whole lotta love [x8]
