Lyrics:


Meet me in a dream
Meet me in a song
Or in a melody
That lasts too long
But stop
Invading my thoughts

Meet me in a crowd
We wonât know if itâs real
Because weâre not allowed
To show how we feel
But stop
Invading my thoughts

I know you donât mean to
And all my fronting you see through
But stop
Just stop
Invading my thoughts
