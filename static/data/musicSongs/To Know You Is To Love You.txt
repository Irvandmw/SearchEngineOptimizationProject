Lyrics:


To know you, is to love you, 
And I love you... 'cause I know you... 
Are such a sweetheart... 
that when you walk down the street, 
Everyone's heart, just naturally skips a beat! 

The others, who have met you, 
Better start in... to forget you... 
Because, to know you is to love you so, 
It's time for everyone you know, 
To know you... love me! 

Were you the sun, it would be twice as sunny, 
Were you a bee, there would be sweeter honey, 
Were you a tune everyone would be croonin'
Harmonizin' out in the street! 
You're such a bundle of me oh my, 
And that's the reason when you go by, 
Each heart naturally skips a beat! 

Dear... 

The others... 
(Were you the spring, you would be twice as springy!) 
Who have met you... 
(Were you a vine, you would be twice as clingy!) 
Better start in... 
(Were you the moon, everyone would be spoonin'!)
To forget you... 
(Every night would be mighty sweet!) 
Because, to know you is to love you so, 
It's time for everyone you know, 
To know you... love me! 

Because, to know you is to love you so, 
It's time for everyone you know, 
To know you... everyone should know you... 
Know... yes, know... you love me!
