Lyrics:


Yeah, alright
Yeah, yeah, ah

It's kinda funny how life can change
Can flip 180 in a matter of days
Sometimes love works in mysterious ways
One day you wake up gone without a trace

I refuse to give up
I refuse to give in
You're my everything
I don't wanna give up
I don't wanna give in, oh
So, everybody, sing

One love for the mother's pride
One love for the times we cried
One love gotta stay alive
I will survive
One love for the city streets
One love for the hip-hop beats
One love, oh, I do believe
One love is all we need

Aha, come on

Late at night I'm still wide awake
Feel this is far more than I can take
I thought my heart could never break, never break
Now I know that's one big mistake

I refuse to give up
I refuse to give in
You're my everything
(That's right. Come on.)
I don't wanna give up
I don't wanna give in, no, no
Everybody, sing

One love for the mother's pride
One love for the times we cried
One love gotta stay alive
I will survive
One love for the city streets
One love for the hip-hop beats
One love, oh, I do believe
One love is all we need

Baby, just love me, love me, love me
Baby, just hold me, hold me, hold me
Oh, love me, love me, love me, ooh

One love

Baby, just love me, love me, love me
Baby, just hold me, hold me, hold me
Oh, love me, love me, love me, ooh

One love for the mother's pride
One love for the times we cried
One love gotta stay alive
I will survive
One love for the city streets
One love for the hip-hop beats
One love, oh, I do believe
One love is all we need

One love for the mother's pride
One love for the times we cried
One love gotta stay alive
I will survive
One love for the city streets
One love for the hip-hop beats
One love, oh, I do believe
One love is all we need
