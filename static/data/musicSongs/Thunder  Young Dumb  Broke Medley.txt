Lyrics:


[Khalid:]
So you're still thinking of me just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment, I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

While we're young dumb
Young, young, dumb, and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb, and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids

[Dan Reynolds:]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, I wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Dan Reynolds & Khalid:]
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder

[Khalid:]
We have so much in common, we argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure I'm right
[Dan Reynolds:]
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

[Dan Reynolds & Khalid:]
While we're young dumb
Young, young, dumb, and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb, and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder

[Khalid:]
Oh, yeah
Nah, yeah
Oh, no, oh, yeah
[Dan Reynolds:]
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb, and broke
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder

[Dan Reynolds & Khalid:]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb, and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb, and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids

Ya da da da da da da da, ya da da da da da da
Ya da da da da da da da
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Ya da da da da da da da, ya da da da da da da
Ya da da da da da da da
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
