Lyrics:


Hereâs to the twilight
hereâs to the memories
these are my souvenirs
my mental pictures of everything
Hereâs to the late nights
hereâs to the firelight
these are my souvenirs
my souvenirs

I close my eyes and go back in time
I can see youâre smiling, youâre so alive
we were so young, we had no fear
we were so young, we had no idea
that life was just happening
life was just happening

Hereâs to your bright eyes
shining like fireflies
these are my souvenirs
the memory of a lifetime
we were wide-eyed with everything
everything around us
we were enlightened by everything
everything

So I close my eyes and go back in time
I can see you smiling, youâre so alive
I close my eyes and go back in time
you were just a child then, and so was I
we were so young, we had no fear
we were so young, we had no idea
that nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts
nothing lasts
you and me together
were always now or never

Can you hear me?
can you hear me?
I close my eyes and go back in time
I can see you smiling, youâre so alive
I close my eyes and go back in time
you were wide-eyed, you were wide-eyed
we were so young, we had no fear
we were so young, we had just begun
a song we knew, but we never sang
it burned like fire inside our lungs
and life was just happening (and nothing lasts, nothing lasts forever)
and life was just happening (and nothing lasts, nothing lasts forever)
I wouldnât trade it for anything
my souvenirs.
