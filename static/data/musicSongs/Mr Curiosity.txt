Lyrics:


Hey, Mr. Curiosity,
Is it true what they've been saying about you?
Are you killing me?
You took care of the cat already.
And for those who think it's heavy.
Is it the truth or is it only gossip?

Call it mystery or anything
Just as long as you'd call me.
I sent the message on.
Did you get it when I left it?
See this catastrophic event
It wasn't meant to mean no harm
But to think there's nothing wrong is a problem

I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
Love is a mystery
Mr. Curious
Come back to me

Mr. Waiting-Ever-Patient, can't you see
That I'm the same the way you left me
In a hurry to spell-check me?
And I'm underlined already in envy green and pencil red
And I've forgotten what you said.
Will you stop working for the dead and return?

Mr. Curious, well, I need some inspiration.
It's my birthday and I cannot find no cause for celebration.
The scenario is grave, but I'll be braver when you save me
From this situation laden with hearsay.

I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful, but it's making me cry.
And love is a mystery.
Mr. Curiosity,
Be Mr. Please-Do-Come-And-Find-Me

Find me
Find me
Find me

Re mi
Come and save
Waiting ever
...

I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful, but it's making me cry.
Trying not to ask why
This love is a mystery.
Mr. Curiosity,
Be Mr. Please-Do-Come-And-Find-Me

Love is blinding when the timing's never right.
Oh who am I to beg for difference
Finding love in just an instant?
Well, I don't mind.
At least I've tried, well, I tried, I tried.
