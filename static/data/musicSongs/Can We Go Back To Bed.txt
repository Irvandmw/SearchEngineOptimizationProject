Lyrics:


Can we go back to bed?
Sleep a little longer
Voices in our heads
Drowned out in the thunder
Can we go back to bed?
'Cause I'm not ready to wake up

I hate that we been so distant
'Cause you know that I love you
Traveled 36 hours just to kiss you and hug you
You're so far, and all I want is to touch you
Smell your cheeks, you know the weird ways I loved you
Now we falling apart and it's killing me slowly
I'm not ready for another girl to touch me or hold me
We was more than lovers, you were my homie
Remember late, late nights, me, you Annie and Kobe
I'm so obsessed with your spirit
I think that you need to hear it
You always doubtin' yourself
You way more than your appearance
I think album money made you
Beautiful, beautiful angel
Perfection in every angle
Now losing you is so painful, damn

I know I'm not Mr. Perfect
I know I left you to hurt
Now we just focused on workin'
Manifestin' my purpose
And I'm beaten and burnin'
You know that you are my person
You know that you are my person, yeah

Can we go back to bed?
Sleep a little longer
Voices in our heads
Drowned out in the thunder
Can we go back to bed?
'Cause I'm not ready to wake up

Yeah, I miss your mom and your dad
Your sisters, brothers, all of that (All of that)
Remember Christmastime by the pool
I never, ever had a family so that shit was cool
Yeah, I felt like one of they own
I wish we spent more time together
Wish you lived in my home
Yeah, I wish I wasn't so busy
I wish that you could be with me
I wish you lived in my city, man
But I just want you to know
That we should try and make this work 'cause I die watchin' you go
If I see you with another guy, think I'd explode
Thinkin' 'bout you with somebody made my stomach go off
Go off

Can we go back to bed?
Sleep a little longer
Voices in our heads
Drowned out in the thunder
Can we go back to bed?
'Cause I'm not ready to wake up
