Lyrics:


Sometimes when I'm thinkin' that love's not around
My heart begins sinkin', I don't hear a sound
And the world is in blackness, no light shines on me
I suffer no blindness, no one can I see
Then a flash from the heavens like a loud jagged wire
And the silence is broken, and the night is on fire.

[Chorus:]
It's like chain lightning, this love that I feel.
Who know's where it strikes or ]
