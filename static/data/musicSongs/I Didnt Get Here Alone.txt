Lyrics:


To everyone who helped pave my way
If it weren't for you I wouldn't be here today
To all my friends, the girls, the broken hearts
All the critics, cynics and doubters
Y'all know who you are

Mom and dad, and all your prayers
And those looking down from up there

I didn't get here alone
That road's just too rough and long
I might be the one the spotlight's on
But I didn't get here alone
Yeah, I know I didn't get here alone

That old ball coach that pushed me way too hard
That preacher man said, "Trust in God" and you'll go far
And I'll never forget the songs that changed my path
Just one more reason, I'm where I'm at

Yeah, I hit walls and I wanted to quit
I picked myself up but the truth is, yeah, the truth is

I didn't get here alone
That road's just too rough and long
I might be the one the spotlight's on
But I didn't get here alone
I know I didn't get here alone

The crew, the band
Yeah and all you fans
That stood in line rain or shine
I want to thank everybody out there for the ride

'Cause I didn't get here alone
Ain't traveled one mile on my own
You're why I sing my song
You're why I sing my song

I didn't get here alone
That road's just too rough and long
I might be the one the spotlight's on
But I didn't get here alone
Yeah, I know I didn't get here alone
