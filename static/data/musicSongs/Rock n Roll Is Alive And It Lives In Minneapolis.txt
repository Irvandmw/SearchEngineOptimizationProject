Lyrics:


Rock 'n' roll is alive
Rock 'n' roll is alive
Rock 'n' roll is alive
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis

From all over the world
The people came
Even the president flies in to watch the thing called fame
Red, white and blue boy girls
Tonight everyone's the same
Some people say it's dying
But we don't want to play that game

Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis - sing
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis - sing
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis

Sure as the drive around
Lake of the Isles is cool I know
Rock 'n' roll will never die
Like the Minnehaha flow
Sure as the land of a thousand lakes
Is sometimes made of snow
There'll always be another king who got butt naked on the floor

Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis - sing
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis

Rock, rock
Very impressive
Rock, rock
Impressive

Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Sing Dammitt!
Rock, rock
Rock 'n' roll is alive
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
