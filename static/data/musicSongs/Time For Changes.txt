Lyrics:


You've been given up and moving on
Been a runaway for far too long
What's the use in you crying tough
When you are longing for love

I can offer you company
Tender loving and harmony
I'll give you everything inside
If you would give me a try

This is time, a time for changes
Anybody's fool can see
This is a day, a day for you and me

Anytime you are ready
Hold the line I'm gonna run to you
Anytime it could happen
And make this dream come true

We can let the sun come in shining in
We can make a new life begin
I'm living for you can't you see
So take a chance on me

This is time, a time for changes
Anybody's fool can see
This is a day, a day for you and me

Anytime you are ready
Hold the line I'm gonna run to you
Anytime it could happen
And make this dream come true

No thunder and lightning will keep me away
Any moment you call me, I'll be on my way
My heart is on fire with a burning desire

Anytime you are ready
Hold the line I'm gonna run to you
Anytime it could happen
And make this dream come true
