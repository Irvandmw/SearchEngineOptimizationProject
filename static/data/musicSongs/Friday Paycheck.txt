Lyrics:


Monday mornin' got my work boots on
My checkbook tells me that my money is gone
Gotta little honey dependin' on me
To take her to town at the end of the week
We'll find a parkin' spot so we can reconnect
As soon as I get my Friday paycheck

We'll get a chili cheese dog at the bowlin' lane
I'm still a workin' on that perfect game
Maybe catch a movie when my arm goes numb
Wrap it around her when the good part comes
I may look like an old redneck
But I'm a high-roller with a Friday paycheck

Everybody knows I like to have a good time
I just gotta stay above that poverty line
Food on the table, roof over head
Leave somethin' to my young 'uns when I wind up dead
You never know what life will throw at you next
I'm countin' down the day 'til my Friday paycheck

Wish I could tell the foreman when I'm under the gun
Take this job and shove it son
I keep it to myself 'cause I've gotta get paid
And dance with my baby at the end of the day

I'm a yellin' at the band when they're doin' sound check
Why don't you give me some Cash with my P-P-Paycheck

Everybody knows I like to have a good time
I just gotta stay above that poverty line
Food on the table, roof over head
Leave somethin' to my young 'uns when I wind up dead
You never know what life will throw at you next
I'm countin' down the day 'til my Friday paycheck

5, 4, 3, 2, 1

You never know what life will throw at you next
I'm countin' down the days 'til my Friday paycheck
I gotta get my hands on that Friday paycheck
