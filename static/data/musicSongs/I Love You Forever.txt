Lyrics:


Hold me in your loving arms, please
Please don't be alarmed, no
Don't sound the alarm
You're always on my mind
I wish you were mine
I wish I can tell you how I feel (how I feel)
I wish I wasn't scared
Don't think you're prepared
For me to tell you how I feel (I feel, I feel)
Even on the days we don't speak
Just to thought of you makes me weak
I feel like [?] I feel I'm a fucking a creep
Pick up the pieces that make me whole again
Give me a reason to live
I said you pick up the pieces that make me whole again
Give me a reason to live
I don't know where am I going
I don't know where I been but
I can't go down to the road again
No I can't, No I can't, I say
I wish I was handsome, I wish I was funny
I wish I was smart and had a whole lot of money
I wish I was good enough for you, for you
I wish I was handsome, I wish I was funny
I wish I was smart and had a whole lot of money
I wish I was good enough for you, ooo
She said oh no no, oh no
You don't see the things that I see
She said oh no
You can't fathom the possibilities
And if you'd open up your mind
Maybe there you'll work fine
And I'll love you forever
And I'll love you forever more, forever
And I'll love you forever more, forever
And I'll love you forever more, forever
And I'll love you forever
I love you forever
And she said
I think you beautiful, I think you funny
I think you smart don't give a fuck about the money
Cause baby you're good enough
For me, for me
And she said
I think you beautiful, I think you funny
I think you smart don't give a fuck about the money
Cause baby you're good enough
Your good enough
Your good enough
