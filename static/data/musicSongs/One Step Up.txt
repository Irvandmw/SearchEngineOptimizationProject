Lyrics:


Woke up this mornin'
The house was cold
Checked the furnace she wasn't burnin'
Went out and hopped in my old Ford
Hit the engine but she ain't a turnin'
Given each other some hard lessons lately
But we aren't learnin'
Same sad story thats a fact
Once step up and two steps back

Bird on a wire outside my motel room but he ain't singin'
Girl in white outside a church in june
but the church bells they ain't ringin'
Sittin' here in this bar tonight
and all I'm thinkin' is
How the same old story same old act
One step up and two steps back 

Its the same thing night all night
Who's wrong and baby who's right
Another fight and I slam the door on
Another battle in our dirty little war
When I look at myself I don't see the man I wanted to be
somewhere along the line I slipped off track
livin' one step up and two steps back

There's a girl across the bar
I get the message she's sendin'
Mmm she ain't lookin' too married
We well honey I pretended
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms 
the music was never endin '
we danced as the evening sky faded to black
movin' one step up and two steps up
(one step up and two steps back)
one step up and two steps back
(one step up and two steps back)
One step up and two steps back
(one step up and two steps back)
one step up and two steps back

ohhh..baby we're movin'

One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
mmm..one step up and two steps back
(one step up and two steps back)
(one step up and two steps back)
