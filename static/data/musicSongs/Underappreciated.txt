Lyrics:


I remember when it all first began
We were tight right from the start
It wasn't long before you came on strong
Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it)

I played hard to get but I couldn't help
But give up my heart in the end
You were thoughtful
Careful not to hurt the relationship

What happened to those days when
You used to be compassionate
Caring what I thought and said
So attentive, a gentleman
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set
Taking me for granted lately
Frankly, it's gotta quit

I feel underappreciated
Now girls help me out
'Cause you know what I'm talking about
I said
I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

Back to the beginning, to the very beginning
When our love was something new
Back when romance was important
Not just another thing to do

I was feeling high on loves delight
Thought I'd never come back down
Now it seems that you and me
Have lost our solid ground

After time I realized
I seem to give more than I get
Funny how things seem to change
After a few years commitment

Used to talk for hours on end
Of our dreams while we lay in bed
How I missed those days when you stayed awake
Now you roll over and snore instead

I feel underappreciated
Now girls help me out
'Cause you know what I'm talking about
I said
I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I miss the nice massages
The long phone calls
And the way you talked
How it'd turn me on
Miss the bubble baths, had the sweetest laughs

I'm needing those days back

I feel underappreciated
Now girls help me out
'Cause you know what I'm talking about
I said
I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment ...
