Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
Like you used to do with me
Oh, but whoâll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, oh, wait and see

And I do mean, I wanna be around to see how she does it
When she breaks your heart to bits
Now letâs see how the puzzle fits so fine

And thatâs when Iâll discover that revenge is so sweet
As I sit there applaudinâ from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Oh, yeah, like you, oh, like you broke mine, yeah
