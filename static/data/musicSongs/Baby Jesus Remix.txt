[DaBaby:]
Yeah
I was talkin' to God
Thankinâ Him for everything he did for me
Thankin' Him for everything he gave me
I asked him why I'm so special
He told me Iâm the chosen one

Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me (But what they call me?)
Yeah, bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, I'm breakin' bread, bitch I'm ballin' (Bitch I'm ballinâ)
Yeah, bitch I think Iâm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, I got water drippin' off me (I got water drippinâ off me)
Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, it feel like I can walk on water (It feel like I can walk on water)
Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Yeah yeah yeah)

When I pull up in that beamer (Skrrt)
I got that 4-5 on my seat (Bow)
I smokin' California reefer
Iâm screamin' out, "Fuck the police!" (Fuck 'em)
I'm smashin' out soon as I see 'em (Skrrt)
These niggas go nothin' on me (Nothin')
They make believe, I make believers (Ha)
These bitches treat me like a God (God)
I fuck them hoes two at a time (At a time)
I only put facts in my rhymes (In my rhymes)
I put that on God, I ain't lyin' (On God)
These niggas must thought I was playin' (Thought I was playin')
Until that boy brought out them bands (Brought out them bands)
My nigga done crossed me again (Damn)
Feel like I lost all of my friends
I-I-I can't even hide it no more
It ain't no secret, I'm the truth (I'm the truth)
These niggas don't play with lil Jon (Playin')
And the day that they play, I'ma shoot (Bow)
These bitches, they know that you lyin' (They know that you lyin')
We see you out all of the time (See you out all of the time)
Where that foreign car that you drive? (Where it's at?)
Niggas playin' tricks on your mind

Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me (But what they call me?)
Yeah, bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, I'm breakin' bread, bitch I'm ballin' (Bitch I'm ballin')
Yeah, bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, I got water drippin' off me (I got water drippin' off me)
Yeah, Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, it feel like I can walk on water (It feel like I can walk on water)
Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Yeah yeah yeah)

[Boosie Badazz:]
My neck, it be shinin', my wrist, it be blindin', I wake up feelin' good (Good)
My neck is so water, I'm sexin' your daughter, I hit her with the hood (Hood)
Ever seen a nigga with a mindset? (With a mindset?)
Jewel House down with a Kel Tec? (Bow bow)
Everything I rap, man, I live that (Live that)
So every nigga in the trap gotta feel that
Good life, I deserve it, dog (I deserve it)
Fuck you, I'm supposed to ball
I tell a bitch straight like this (Ay cuz)
Fuck one, I want both of y'all (I want both of y'all)
I ain't die from cancer so (Woo)
I feel like I'm walkin' on water
Feel like I'm back in the fifth grade
The year that I got my first starter (Yeah)
Boy, I'm a beast up at Charlotte
It's nothin' can stop me, I'm blessed
I wake up, I count up a check
I fuck 'em, I leave 'em, I keep 'em in stress
Big blue hundreds, I keep 'em on deck
Stop all that stunt 'fore I put you in check
Death row couldn't kill a nigga or diabetes
Man I feel like Baby Jesus

[DaBaby:]
Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me (But what they call me?)
Yeah, bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, I'm breakin' bread, bitch I'm ballin' (Bitch I'm ballin')
Yeah, bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, I got water drippin' off me (I got water drippin' off me)
Yeah, Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, it feel like I can walk on water (It feel like I can walk on water)
Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Yeah yeah yeah)

And it ain't shit you can tell me (Tell me)
I came up out here on my own (On my own)
I didn't need no one to help me
Them plays keep on callin' my phone (My phone)
'Cause they know Baby Jesus gon' bless 'em (Bless 'em)
A couple niggas want my dome (My dome)
'Cause that boy baby Jesus finessed 'em
These bitches tell me I'm conceited ('Ceited)
'Cause I call myself Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
But it complement my demeanor (My demeanor)
All throughout that they switchin' my sneakers
Like a king, I'ma die on this gold (Ice ice ice)
When you make, niggas, they wanna kill you
Seen it comin' a long time ago
Before I had it I knew I was that nigga
Back in the day before I had the clothes (Before I had the clothes)
Talkin' way before I had the hoes (Before I had the hoes)
Now these niggas, they actin' surprised (Wow)
I can see jealousy in they eyes (Wow)
They tell me I'm out of my mind (Wow)
'Cause I told 'em, "Stop callin' me Jon" (Oof)
God told me I'm here for a reason
He gave me the name Baby Jesus

Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me (But what they call me?)
Yeah, bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Yeah, I'm breakin' bread, bitch I'm ballin' (Bitch I'm ballin')
Yeah, bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, I got water drippin' off me (I got water drippin' off me)
Yeah, Bitch I think I'm Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
Ooh, it feel like I can walk on water (It feel like I can walk on water)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
