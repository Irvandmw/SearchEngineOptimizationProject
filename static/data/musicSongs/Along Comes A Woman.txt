Lyrics:


There is a time when a man needs someone to talk to
Someone to talk to, somebody who'll always be there
All alone, nothin' seemed to matter
So alone, doesn't get much better
Can't explain somethin' that you're feelin'
For the very first time
There was a time when you needed someone to hold onto
Someone to hold you, somebody who's always sincere
All alone, suddenly you see her
So alone, you know you're gonna need her
Can't explain, somethin' that you're feelin'
For the very first time

[CHORUS:]
Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feelin' tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right
There was a time when you needed someone to count on
You needed someone to count on
Someone to care
Now she's here, nothin' seems to matter
She's so near, everything is better
Can't explain, somethin' that you're feelin'
For the very first time

[CHORUS]
