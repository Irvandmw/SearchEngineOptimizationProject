Lyrics:


I am a steady rollin' man
And I roll both night and day.
I am a steady rollin' man
And I roll both night and day.
But I ain't got no sweet woman,
Woo-hoo Lord, to be rollin' this way.

I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree.
I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree.
Why can't you hear me begging mama,
Woo-hoo Lord, down on my bended knee?

[Repeat First Verse]
