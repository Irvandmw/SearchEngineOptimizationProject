Lyrics:


Remember that time we were just kickin'
But nothing had changed, nothing was really different
Then love showed it's teeth like it was something vicious
No, no, no, let me finish
Ain't it something when it all goes tragic
How a spell can get casted onto something magic
What I wouldn't give to get back to where we had it
Oh, it should've lasted

Now it's like I lied
When I said I didn't need you
Alright if you'd left I'd never be
Tonight can we just get it right
Somehow, for now

Freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the old familiar thoughts
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we've lost
For now

Oh, I'm so goddamn mean
'Cause I, I, I say and I do things that I shouldn't sometimes
My mouth gets me in trouble all the time

But now it's like I lied
When I said I didn't need you
I die if you'd left I'd never be alright
Can we just get it right somehow
For now

Freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the old familiar thoughts
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we've lost
For now, for now
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we've lost
For now

Remember that time we were just kickin'
But nothing had changed, nothing was really different
Then love showed it's teeth like it's something vicious
No, no, no, let me finish
For now

Freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the old familiar thoughts
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we've lost
For now, for now
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we've lost
For now, for now
Can we just rewind, stop
Get back to the feelings we think we've lost
For now
