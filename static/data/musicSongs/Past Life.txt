Lyrics:


Oh, I could feel the change a-comin'
Felt it in the breeze
Oh, I could feel the change a-comin'
Comin' right for me
Oh, I could feel the change a-comin'
Saw it on TV
Oh, I could feel the change a-comin'
Saw it staring right on back at me

Oh, I could feel the shadow comin'
Straight on down the line
Masquerading like you was a friend of mine
Oh, I could feel the darkness wrappin'
All its arms in mine
Oh, I could feel the world was turnin'
All inside my mind
Oh, I could feel the world was turnin'
All inside, all inside my mind

I knew it when it started
Felt the shift right as it parted
Saw my feet cried down below me
Saw the whole room move around me
Saw my old life and my old friends
Saw me haunted, saw me back again

Oh, maybe there's a past life comin' out inside of me
Maybe it's the song I'm singing'
Maybe everything's just turnin' out how it should be
Maybe there's a past life comin' out inside of me
Oh, maybe there's a past life comin' out inside, inside of me
