Lyrics:


People talking from every direction
Every hello and every goodbye
Feels like a cry for attention
People, but there's no human connection
If you want something real tonight
Baby, you know where to get it

That overglow
Where the moment goes
Leave me all alone
But you would never know
It's got a hold on you
In the neon blue
Up on your phone
In the overglow

Day and night, if you're lost in delusion
And from every word in your text
Only your fingers are bruising
Day and night, I tried loving you thru it
And it's breaking my heart that I can't
Feel like I'm losing you to it

That overglow
Where the moment goes
Leave me all alone
But you would never know
It's got a hold on you
In the neon blue
Up on your phone
In the overglow

In the overglow
In the overglow

There's no human connection
(That overglow)
But there's no human connec-

That overglow
Where the moment goes
Leave me all alone
But you would never know
It's got a hold on you
In the neon blue
Up on your phone
In the overglow
That overglow
Where the moment goes
Leave me all alone
But you would never know
It's got a hold on you
In the neon blue
Up on your phone
In the overglow

That overglow (In the overglow)
