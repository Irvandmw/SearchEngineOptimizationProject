Lyrics:


[Verse 1]
Sell me candy like itâs summer when itâs melting in my hands
I know youâre around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
Iâm weak by your touch and when itâs melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
Youâre selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core

[Bridge:]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need
Is you beside me
Itâs destiny
Just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby sell it to me

[Chorus:]
Sell me candy, sell me love, sell me heaven, sell me doves
Whatâs the charge? Whatâs the cost?
(Iâm the daddy)â¦ you the boss.

[Verse 2]
You could be a professional, boy you make a sale
I try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body now youâre knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that youâre rocking is nothing like me
Youâre selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core (you knowâ¦)

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I wanna playâ¦ more than you know
So donât you leaveâ¦ and donât you go
I want it allâ¦ until time falls
His armsâ¦ I want to roam
I want to loveâ¦ give him my trust
I want to liveâ¦ for both of us
I want to breathe youâ¦ lay on your shoulder
I want to warm youâ¦ when nights get colder
I want loveâ¦ loveâ¦ love
I want loveâ¦ loveâ¦ love

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
