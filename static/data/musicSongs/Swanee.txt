Lyrics:


Way down upon the Swanee river
Far far away
Swanee how I love you how I love you
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world to be among the folks of D-I-X
I even know my mammy's waiting for me, praying for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to my Swanee shore

Mammy's waiting for me, praying for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore
