Lyrics:


I take my drugs in doses

I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite
We been gone on the molly
Holding onto Friday
Why you looking at me shawty
Recognizing I'm the only, only, only one that's ballinâ
Only one thatâs ballinâ
Only one whoâs going out the country
Gotta keep a translator for the models
Only one, Iâm only reppinâ fly shit only
Keep some fly shit on me, keep a fly bitch on me

Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only

My trainers are matching my jacket
Iâm strapped with that ratchet, Iâm strapped with that Bape and that ape
Iâm gone off these medicals, gone off these medicals
Maybe one day Iâmma get out the drank
And maybe one day we can fuck in the bank
I made me a Porsche out of two and a quarter
I got to Morocco and lay in some foreigns
Then I come back to Onyx and find me that one I can fuck on
And touch on and turn up and turn on
We donât watch TV, we count Fettuccine
4 and a half, itâs right under my beanie
I made me some snaps then I fucked on a genie
Put her in a cab and I jumped in a âGhini
You gonâ need yellow tape when I step on the scene
When you send me an invite, I come with a bitch like
She wrapped up in plastic, got coke in the mattress
All of this shit is about living lavish
This money, these cars, and these bitches, these carats
These radical styles, Iâma give you a style
You can take it, your new style ainât gonâ make you a pile

I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite
We been gone on the molly
Holding onto Friday
Why you looking at me shawty
Recognizing I'm the only, only, only one that's ballinâ
Only one thatâs ballinâ
Only one whoâs going out the country
Gotta keep a translator for the models
Only one, Iâm only reppinâ fly shit only
Keep some fly shit on me, keep a fly bitch on me

Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only

Light skinned bone the same color macaroni
Put her hair in a pony, hit a note like Tony
I know this shit been on lonely, now Iâm back on my lonely
And Iâm back how you want it and Iâm back and Iâm on it
Made a film like Sony, fuck the fake and the phony
I gots cake in the morning, I rock Adidas and Margielas
I be staying at the telly, eat a sandwich out the deli
And my life is like Belly, young future, sincere

I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite
We been gone on the molly
Holding onto Friday
Why you looking at me shawty
Recognizing I'm the only, only, only one that's ballinâ
Only one thatâs ballinâ
Only one whoâs going out the country
Gotta keep a translator for the models
Only one, Iâm only reppinâ fly shit only
Keep some fly shit on me, keep a fly bitch on me

Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
