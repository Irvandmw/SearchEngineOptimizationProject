Lyrics:


I hear those jingle bells
On this midnight clear
Hark the herald angels sing
Soon Santa will be here
All I want for Christmas
Is a silent night with you
And a frosty morning snow so we can go
On a sleigh ride just for two

Have a very Merry Christmas Day
And a Happy New Year too
Thank you for the love you give
My greatest gift is you
You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do
Merry Christmas, I love you

When I count my blessings, you're the first one on my list
And when I feel a little lonely, you're the only one I miss

Have a very Merry Christmas Day
And a Happy New Year too
Thank you for the love you give
My greatest gift is you
You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do
Merry Christmas, I love you

You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do
Merry Christmas, I love you
You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, I love you
Merry Christmas, I love you
