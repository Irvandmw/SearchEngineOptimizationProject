Lyrics:


Oh ah oh, yeah

I wanna see the Eiffel tower, and stay up there for hours
I'll be your Mona Lisa and get lost in your Louvre
Or we could go to Asia, yeah, I'll dress like a Geisha
You can be my ninja, I'm your harajuku

So we say aye oh
Well as long as I'm with you, I'll never say no to a flight
Let me hear you say aye oh
With a love this filthy rich, we don't need pesos tonight

Baby, let's go oh ah oh
Baby, let's go oh ah oh
I'll be your jetset, baby, your passport's ready
Take me all over the globe
Baby, let's go oh ah oh

We can sail down to Aruba, and swim with baracudas
We got them cute umbrella-ellas up in our drinks
Take the red-eye out to Vegas, rack city's got them players
We'll find us an Elvis and get hitched by the king

So we say aye oh
Well, as long as I'm with you, I'll never say no to a flight
Let me hear you say aye oh
With a love this filthy rich, we don't need pesos tonight

Baby, let's go oh ah oh (Baby lets go oh oh oh)
Baby, let's go oh ah oh (Baby lets go, baby lets go oh oh oh)
I'll be your jetset, baby, your passport's ready
You take me all over the globe
Baby, let's go oh ah oh

A one-way ticket out of here tonight
You and me heading out to paradise
Holding hands and rolling down the runway
Our love's ready for the great escape, yeah
Mmmm baby, let's go oh oh oh oh oh

So we say aye oh
Well, as long as I'm with you, I'll never say no to a flight
Let me hear you say aye oh
With a love this filthy rich, we don't need pesos tonight

Baby, let's go oh ah oh (mmm baby lets go oh oh oh)
Baby, let's go oh ah oh (Baby lets go, baby lets go oh oh oh)
I'll be your jetset, baby, your passport's ready
You take me all over the globe
Baby, let's go oh ah oh
Oh baby lets go oh oh oh
