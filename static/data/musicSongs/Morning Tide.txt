Lyrics:


Rise with me now, and we'll walk to the shore
We'll look over the waves to the break of day
I'll hold your hand, I'll hold you close
I'll wipe away your tears, and no one will know

On the morning tide
We'll hoist the sails to brave the crashing waves
Won't you come with me and hear the ocean sigh
And if to its depths it called us by our names
Won't you sail to the shore with me

Come to me now, and together we'll go
Where the clearer winds blow, far and beyond
Leaving behind all our sorrow and pride
Kissing them goodbye, into another life

On the morning tide
We'll hoist the sails to brave the crashing waves
Won't you come with me and hear the ocean sigh
And if to its depths it called us by our names
Won't you sail to the shore with me

Won't you come with me
Sail to the shore with me
Won't you come with me, come with me, come with me, sail

Love is still here
Never will it leave
You're always with me, and I'm always with you

On the morning tide
We'll hoist the sails to brave the crashing waves
Won't you come with me and hear the ocean sigh
And if to its depths it called us by our names
Won't you sail to the shore with me
