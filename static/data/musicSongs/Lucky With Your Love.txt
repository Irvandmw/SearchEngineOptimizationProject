Lyrics:


You got so much to give
But you hide it all away
You keep holding back
Well, I have oh, so much to say
Like how you make me feel
When you gonna say my name?
It's the little things you do that make me go insane

Should I write this in a letter
Or hit you up with a text
And maybe call you on your phone
Writing songs is what I do best

I wanna be lucky with your love
I wanna be all that you dream of
I can't be everything you need
So baby give it to me, I'll take it all
Give me a chance to make you fall
Baby, I'm trying to make you see
I wanna be lucky with your love

I wanna, I wanna be lucky...

Well, boy you make me shy
Its hard to look you in the face
I'm about to lose my mind
Oh, I just want one taste

Should I write this in a letter
Or hit you up with a text?
Oh, maybe call you on your phone
Writing songs is what I do best

I wanna be lucky with your love
I wanna be all that you dream of
I can't be everything you need
So baby give it to me, I'll take it all
Give me a chance to make you fall
Baby, I'm trying to make you see
I wanna be lucky with your love

I wanna, I wanna be lucky...

So now we're in the same room
I'm telling all my fears to go
So I can pick up a guitar and tell you want you need to know

I wanna be lucky with your love
I wanna be all that you dream of
I can't be everything you need
So baby give it to me, I'll take it all
Give me a chance to make you fall
Baby, I'm trying to make you see
I wanna be lucky with your love

I wanna, I wanna be lucky...
Lucky with your love...
