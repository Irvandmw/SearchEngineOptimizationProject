Lyrics:


Iâm no stranger to deception
I have lied and been lied to
Iâm no paragon of virtue
But I wanna be with you
I have never been a righteous soul
And I donât pretend I am
But I walk the line when Iâm with you
Cause you make me believe I can

But weâre runninâ out of options
And weâre runninâ out of time
And I donât know if itâs you or me
But itâs time to speak your mind

Because Iâm traveling across the sky
When youâre with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And weâll be traveling across sky
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)

Iâm not good at keeping quiet
And I canât keep this tied down
But itâs got to count for somethinâ
That weâre still hanginâ around
If you need an explanation for
What is false and what is true
Then Iâd rather stop the world than think
That I could not be with you

But weâre runninâ out of options
And weâre runninâ out of time
And I donât know if itâs you or me
But itâs time to speak your mind

Because Iâm traveling across the sky
When youâre with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And weâll be traveling across sky
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)

Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Traveling across the sky
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Traveling across the sky
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Traveling across the sky
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Traveling across the sky
