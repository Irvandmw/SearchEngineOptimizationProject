Lyrics:


There's no doubt it was always you
From that first time I walked you home from school
Til you stole my heart underneath that August moon
It was always you, it was always you
Now it hurts to see your pretty smile fade
I've got a front row seat to watch you drift away
And I know there's nothing left for us to say
But it's okay, it's okay

There's no getting over you, I've tried to sugarcoat the truth
But the missing you is tearing me apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute, every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting, forgetting is the hardest part

Sometimes I sit here feeling like a ghost
It's that emptiness I think that hurts the most
But a piece of me still holds a little hope
I should just let go, but I can't let go

There's no getting over you, I've tried to sugarcoat the truth
But the missing you is tearing me apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute, every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting, forgetting is the hardest part

It's time to put myself together and put these pieces back wherever maybe one day I'll find love again, again

There's no getting over you, I've tried to sugarcoat the truth
A million times but I'm still torn apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute, every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting, forgetting is the hardest part
