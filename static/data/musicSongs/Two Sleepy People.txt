Lyrics:


[Both] Here we are out of cigarettes
[LR] Holding hands and yawning
[DM] Look how late it gets
[Both] Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
[Both] And too much in love to say goodnight

[LR] Here we are in the cozy chair
[LR] Picking on a wishbone from the frigidaire
[Both] Two sleepy people with nothing to say
[Both] And too much in love to break away

[DM] Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall
[LR] Father didn't like you at all
[LR] Do you remember the reason why we marries in the fall
[DM] To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

[Both] Well here we are just above the Seine
[LR] Foggy little fella, [DM] drowsy little dame
[Both] Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
[Both] And too much in love to say goodnight

(Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall)
[LR] Father didn't like you at all
((Do you remember the reason why we marries in the fall)
[DM] To rent this little nest and [Both] get a bit of rest

[Both] Well here we are just above the Seine
[LR] Foggy little fella, [DM] drowsy little dame
[Both] Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
[Both] And too much in love to say goodnight
[LR] Bon soir [DM] Bon nuit
