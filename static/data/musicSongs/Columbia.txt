Lyrics:


There we were. Now here we are.
All this confusion. Nothing's the same to me.
There we were. Now here we are.
All this confusion. Nothing's the same to me.

But I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel isâoh!âso new to me.
No, I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel isâoh!âso new to me .

What I heard is not what I hear.
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear.
What I heard is not what I hear.
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear.

So, I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel isâoh!âso new to me.
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel isâoh!âso new to me.

This is confusion. Am I confusing you?
This is confusion. Am I confusing you?
This is peculiar. We don't want to fool you.
This is peculiar. We don't want to fool you.

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
