You and your mind is (the world) beautiful

All this wisdom in my eye God know this what ya see tell where you at I can tell you where to be
When I look into your eyes I see an angel in disguise
Got them Jimmy Choes on yea it's murder with them thighs Lusa Lean bag bet she keep cash in it
Whole thing in her hair bet she keep a jag in it
Girl your body that fit yea you shoulda been a killa
Body so dope yea you shoulda been a dealer

Donât stop âtil you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
