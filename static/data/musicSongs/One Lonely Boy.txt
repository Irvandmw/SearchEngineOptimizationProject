Lyrics:


I'm tired of bein' lonely
and walkin' with the blues.
Live alone can't satisfy my needs.
So I put an advertisement
in Daily Evening News.
It may sound kind of funny, but this is how it reads.

[Chorus:]
It says there's one lonely boy needs one lonely girl. 
To walk along beside him everywhere.
Yes it says there's one lonely boy needs one lonely girl. 
Who has a lot of love she wants to share.

Now heartaches and misfortune
are both old friends of mine.
I never had a true love, Heaven knows.
But I keep right on hoping
that the one I'd like to find.
Who sees my advertisement and this is how it goes.

[Chorus]

Who has a lot of love she wants to share...
