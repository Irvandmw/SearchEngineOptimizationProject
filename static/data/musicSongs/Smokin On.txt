Lyrics:


[Hook]
Bet you get high but I ainât smoking with the rest though
Cause if itâs in my joint, believe that itâs the best smoke
Iâm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though

[Wiz Khalifa]
Cut those cameras on cause my cameraâs on
And my niggas backing me riding around town
With a big old bag of weed
Taylor Gang, we ainât in your faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and we making this cash, and we
Bout it bout it like Master P
Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
TGOD, heâs the OG, real G shit what it has to be
My real niggas gon pop tags for me
Fake niggas gon get bags for me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now Iâm riding around town in the car that you canât even pronounce
And you canât go fast as me
Smoking marijuana, and she know that Iâm a player
So she wanna come up here spend that cash on me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is wack to me
My kush grown organically
My balling is actually

[Hook:]
Bet you get high but I ainât smoking with the rest though
Cause if itâs in my joint, believe that itâs the best smoke
Iâm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though
You like to smoke but you ainât smoking what we smoking, no
You like to smoke but you ainât smoking what we smoking, no

[Snoop Dogg]
Let me turn you on to turn you out
To make you feel how you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got: Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo glow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I donât know
This is that shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glockâoh no!
Cutting it up, button it up
Homie donât speak at all
You might stay, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight: let me break it down for you
Flip it, zip it, let it fly
If itâs good, itâs gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ainât the one
We donât even smoke that shit for fun!

[Hook]

[Juicy J]
Yea nigga, Iâm rolling up that high-grade
Chilling on the porch, smoking like itâs Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy Jâs a high day
Niggas think Iâm Chinese cause my eyes straight
I threw up a 6 into a 20 ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like 20 ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now Iâm high as fuck
Every chick I'm seeing, Juicy screaming out, "Letâs fuck!"
I done popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher

[Hook]
