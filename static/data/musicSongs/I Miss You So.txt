Lyrics:


Those happy hours I spent with you
That lovely afterglow
Most of all I miss you so

Your sweet caresses, each rendezvous
Your voice so soft and low
Most of all I miss you so

You once filled my heart
With no regrets, no fears
Now you find my heart
Filled to the top with tears

I'll always love you and want you, too
How much you'll never know
Most of all I miss you so

I'll always love you and want you, too
How much you'll never know
Most of all I miss you so
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
