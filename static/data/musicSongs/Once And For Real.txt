Lyrics:


You could shake the stars
Out of the sky
It doesn't matter
Our fate's will collide
You can pull the plug out
Watch all the water strain
Still I know it would be the same
Still I know
It would be the sa-ame

I see it in my mi-I-ind's ey-e
A world made just for you and I
So I know
It's worth the wait

O-o-oh
Once is enough
That's how I fe-el
We do this once and for real
Lo-o-ove
Is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and
For real

I'm building my life
To include you
So for now I have someone
To look forward to
I'm in no hurry, no worries you're out there somewhere
Still I hope that you will be here soon
Still I hope
That you would be here so-on

I see it in my mi-I-ind's ey-e
A world made just for you and I
So I know
It's worth the wait

O-o-oh
Once is enough
That's how I fe-el
We do this once and for real
Lo-o-ove
Is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and
For real

Oh oh (I'm waitin' for somethin')
Oh oh (I'm waitin' for somethin')
Oh oh (I'm waitin' for yo-u)
Ye-ah

O-o-oh
Once is enough
That's how I fe-el
We do this once and for real
Lo-o-ove
Is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and
For real

Once is enough
That's how I fe-el
We do this once and
For real
Lo-o-ove
Is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and
For real
