Lyrics:


They can say
Anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I will not allow
Anyone to succeed
Hanging clouds over me

And they can try
Hard to make me feel that I
Don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter
In what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams

'Cause there's
There's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me

No no no

Oh they they can do
Anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to your pride
And just push them aside

See I I have learned
There's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul
That they can not possess
So I won't be afraid
And the darkness will fade

'Cause there's
There's a light in me
That shines brightly
Yes they can try
But they can't take that away from me

No
They can't take this
Precious love I'll always have inside me
Certainly the Lord will guide me where I need to go

They can say
Anything they want to say
Try to break me down
But I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily
Sailing out of their reach

Oh Lord they do try
Hard to make me feel that I
Don't matter at all
But I'll refuse to falter
In what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams

'Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly
Yes

They can try but they can't take that away from me from me
No no no
