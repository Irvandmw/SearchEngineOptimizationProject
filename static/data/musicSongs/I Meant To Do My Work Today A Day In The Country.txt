Lyrics:


I meant to do my work today
But a brown bird sang in the apple tree
I know that one too
And a buttefly flitted across the field
And all the leaves were calling me
And the buttercups nodded their smiling heads
Greeting the bees who came to call
And I asked the lizard the time of day
As he sunned himself on a moss grove
And the wind went sighing over the land
Tossing the grasses to and fro
And a rainbow held out its shining hand
So what could I do but laugh and go
My mother died when I was born
I live with my father on our own
And we had a cottage where we'd go
And he died too, now I'm alone
