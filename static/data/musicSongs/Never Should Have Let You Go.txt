Lyrics:


I'm coming home to an empty room
my head is spinning on a Sunday afternoon
there was a time when I had it all
I can still remember but I'm barely hanging on

so tell me what to do to make you change you're mind
I wish that I could find a way to turn back time
cause life's just not the same since you've been gone.

I never should have let you go
cause I'm falling to pieces
I just wanna let you know
that I can't keep pretending
I never should have let you go
you're so far away
and I just can't live without you
I just can't breathe without you
I never should have let you go.

What's on you're mind and tell me what do you see
and tell me who you think of when you just can't fall asleep
and all the things I took for granted moments gone forever wasted
all the stupid things I did I'd take them back

so tell me what to do to make you change you're mind
I wish that I could find a way to turn back time
cause I'm just not the same since you've been gone.

I never should have let you go
cause I'm falling to pieces
and I just wanna let you know
that I can't keep pretending
I never should have let you go
you're so far away
and I just can't live without you
I just can't breathe without you
I never should have let you go.

And now every single day that I spend without you
getting through the night is the hardest thing to do
since you walked away
I guess you'll never know what its like to miss you
I try to get a grip put my life back into place its not the same.

I'm coming home to an empty room
my head is spinning on a Sunday afternoon.

Cause I'm falling to pieces I just wanna let you know
that I can't keep pretending
I never should have let you go
you're so far away and I just can't live without you
I just can't breathe without you
I never should have let you go.
I'm never gonna let you go.
I never should have let you go.
I'm never gonna let you go.
I never should have let you go.
