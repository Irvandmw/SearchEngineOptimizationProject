Lyrics:


Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that down to the
Back that up to the

Keep on shining your
I'm getting ready for
Let this party go
I'll be back until

Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that down to the
Back that up to the

I'll be drinking Krug RosÃ© and sometimes lemon drops
I'll be wearing diamond grills, and chasing thrills a lot
Now I know how freedom feels, I'm never going to stop
Keep this party going, we'll be dancing till we drop

Do it

Leave them ready for
Guess I'm la-la-low
I'll keep dreaming of
They'll remember us
Means I'm ready for [?]
Move to the beat of the (drum)
Sway to the rhythm of (one)
Waving around like a

Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that down to the
Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that down to the
Back that up to the

I'll be drinking Krug RosÃ©, sometimes lemon drops
I'll wearing diamond grills, and chasing thrills a lot
Now I know how freedom feels, I'm never going to stop

Keep on shining your
I'm getting ready for
Let this falling go
I'll be back until
Leave them ready for
Means I'm ready for
Move to the beat of the
Sway to the rhythm of
Waving around like a
(Drum)

Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that down to the
Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that down to the
Back that up to the

Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that down to the
Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that up to the
Back that down to the
Back that up to the
