Lyrics:


Wish I would never have said it, but if only you meant it
And I will tell you the truth cause that's all I know, so pathetic
You can't ignore that he wants you, he sat you down and he taught you
And you obeyed every rule that he made, cause he bought you
Now he owns you

So don't go away, don't go away
I got something to say about the dark side of me
Dead side of me, light side of me
Dark side of me, dead side of me

I lied to you and you caught me, I shoulda learned what you taught me
And the truth cuts just like a knife, when you cut me
And I'll do all that I told you, I loved it when I would hold you
But those are just things that I said in my head, but she told you
Shoulda told you

So don't go away, don't go away
I got something to say about the dark side of me
Dead side of me, light side of me
Dark side of me, dead side of me

Just let me be, what I want to be

I said I haven't told you anything, I hold it all inside in vain
I think of you and I think of pain, now I've told you everything

I said don't go away, don't go away
I got something to say about the dark side of me
(I said I haven't told you anything)
Dead side of me
(I hold it all inside in van)
Light side of me
(I think of you and I think of pain)
Dark side of me
(Now I've told you everything)
Dead side of me

I said I haven't told you anything, I hold it all inside in vain
I think of you and I think of pain, I never tell you anything
I said I haven't told you anything, I hold it all inside in vain
I think of you and I think of pain, never said it
So forget it
