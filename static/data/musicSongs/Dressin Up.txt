Lyrics:


(Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you) [2x]

Saucer of milk
Table for two
You wanna pet my kitty?
You're such a dirty doggy

It's your lucky night
'Cause I'm in the mood
I'm feeling spicy
I'm feeling real naughty

Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a Lolita
Oh, boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night
I'm dressing up for you

I can tell you're obsessed
By your shortness of breath
Ooh, my cookie monster wants a taste test

Be a good boy
and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer

Pick a part, you dream it up
Librarian, dominatrix
Oh, boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night
I'm dressing up for you

(Dressin' up)

You're getting hot
So let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever
Let's take your temperature

Better behave
Or a police officer
will have to hold you down,
Give you what you deserve

Pick a part, you dream it up
Use your imagination
Oh, boy, I'll be your fantasy
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

[2x]
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night
I'm dressing up for you

Tied tight, tip teasing
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck,
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak
Trembling, trembling, trembling

[2x]
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night
I'm dressing up for you

I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up [5x]
For you
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
