Lyrics:


Lonely in a room no sound to fill your soul
Hopes and dreams are held so close you can't let go
But you can only see when I...
look into your eyes, you pulled me in too deep

Take me in, take me out till I'm...
nothing more than words spoken from your sweet, sweet mouth
And dance around like no one can see, baby
Move your body with the rhythm, move your body next to me

Wanted is love, not going insane
You know you gotta hold on to what you love before it's gone away
Wanted is love, not going insane
You know you gotta hold on to what you love before it's gone away

One step to you and I'm sinking in your lies
Only to see the truth hidden behind your evil eyes
And no light could lead me to the ways of you
Is it me or am I alone? It's all such mystery

Wanted is love, not going insane
You know you gotta hold on to what you love before it's gone away
Wanted is love, not going insane
You know you gotta hold on to what you love before it's gone away

Wanted is love

Wanted is love, not going insane, oh
You know you gotta seek everything you love before it's gone away
Wanted is love, not going insane, no
You know you gotta seek everything you lost before it's gone away

Wanted is love
Wanted is love
