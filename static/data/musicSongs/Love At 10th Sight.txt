Lyrics:


For me
It was love at first sight
But for her
It was more like love at tenth sight
But that didn't stop me from fallin'
In love with her
That didn't stop me
From being the one she deserved

Somehow I convinced this girl
That I really loved her
(I really loved her)
And eventually
She even fell in love with me
(Fell in love with me)
Now the two of us
Are solely in love with each other
That's the story
My baby and me

And the story goes on and on
It's only the beginning
I've got more to give
I would say "I do," baby
And you would love me too
For long as we both shall live

For me
It was love at first sight
And for her
Well, it was more like love
At tenth sight
But I couldn't help but keep fallin'
In love with her
And now I'm spending
The rest of my life
Giving her what she deserves

Somehow I convinced this girl
That I really loved her
(I really loved her)
And eventually
She even fell in love with me
(Fell in love with me)
Now the two of us
Are solely in love with each other
That's the story
My baby and me

And the story goes on and on
It's only the beginning
I've got more to give
I would say "I do," baby
And you would love me too
For long as we both shall live

Somehow I convinced this girl
That I really loved her
(I really loved her)
And eventually
She even fell in love with me
(Fell in love with me)
Now the two of us
Are solely in love with each other
That's the story
My baby and me
That's the story
My baby and me
