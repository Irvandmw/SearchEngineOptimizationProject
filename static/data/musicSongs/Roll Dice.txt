Lyrics:


I-I
I am, I am, I-I-I

I've seen the Reap' come
Live my life I had to roll dice, hmm
Been through strife, my heart is cold as ice
Double cup, I pour a four tonight
Hold tight, low light, but I'm so bright
How you trappin'? Make it happen, ain't got no white
Cold light, call sight, had to provide
I'm a star, I'm just hidden in the low light

I just wanted my blue strips never wanted fame
See bad bitches that'll fuck a lame
Keep all my brothers like fraternities
He don't speak no Englo' like I'm overseas
Spider make you smash out
I got niggas in the sand box
I know they ain't about to rat all on me
My dawg's tongue got the padlock
Horsepower, bought an engine just to mash out
I'm 'bout to smash out, lean out the window with rags out, yeah, yeah

I've seen the Reap' come
Live my life I had to roll dice, hmm
Been through strife, my heart is cold as ice
Double cup, I pour a four tonight
Hold tight, low light, but I'm so bright
How you trappin'? Make it happen, ain't got no white
Cold light, call sight, had to provide
I'm a star, I'm just hidden in the low light

I was starin' at the sky, seeing a UFO
I was high (I was high), really high (Really high)
Everybody, I got gold in my soul
I can't lie (Can't lie), no lie (No lie)
I never force a bye, I'm going to more high (High)
I remember when moms cried, she wanted me law abiding
At his neck like a violin
Got my brothers, we ain't buyin' friends
It started feelin' like my time again
Stay strong, don't fold, don't bend
Told her bend over, I'ma buy her a Benz

I've seen the Reap' come
Live my life I had to roll dice, hmm
Been through strife, my heart is cold as ice
Double cup, I pour a four tonight
Hold tight, low light, but I'm so bright
How you trappin'? Make it happen, ain't got no white
Cold light, call sight, had to provide
I'm a star, I'm just hidden in the low light

I-I
Woo, woo (Ice)
I-I-I (Ice)
So bright, no white, had a poor fight
