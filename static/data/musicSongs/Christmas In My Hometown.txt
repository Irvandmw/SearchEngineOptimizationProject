Lyrics:


I'd love to spend this Christmas with the folks in my hometown
Just to have the gang around, friendly folks in my hometown
I long to see the candles in the windows glow so bright
And the Christmas Trees glitter in the breeze
Seem to say welcome home tonight

Christmas carols softly singing by the fireside all aglow (fireside all aglow)
Children's laughter gaily ringing as they battle in the snow (oh-ho-ho-ho)
My heart is winging homeward as the snow comes fallin' down
I love to spend this Christmas with the folks in my hometown

Christmas carols softly singing by the fireside all aglow (fireside all aglow)
Children's laughter gaily ringing as they battle in the snow (oh-ho-ho-ho)
My heart is winging homeward as the snow comes fallin' down
Oh, I love to spend this Christmas with the folks in my hometown
Friendly folks in my hometown

One more, one more, one more
