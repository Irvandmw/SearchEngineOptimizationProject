Lyrics:


We spending all this money
Spending all this shine
Feeling all this high
Spending all this time
Iâm feeling better than ever before
This my life forâ¦ betterâ¦ or for
All this money
Spending all this shine
And itâs all so funny
Cause itâs all just fine
Iâm feeling better than ever before
This my life forâ¦ betterâ¦ or forâ¦ worse

Iâm looking out the window
The kidâs stayinâ lit like a Zippo
You hatinâ I donât trip bro
Itâs gravy cause your bitch know
Cup of Henny, I sip slow
The spins, yo
Hit the stage to bust a rhyme call me flip mode
This, that the other rhymer make it happen
Travel all around the country in a station wagon
Take it back you reminiscinâ all your favorite classics
My words play more than madlibs
I got plenty lyrics
They got plenty adlibs
Want a holy spirit
My fatherâs on some rap shit
Listeninâ to trap, getting high puffinâ loud
See some people ridinâ by
Come outside say what up
I ainât nothing like a star
Iâm chilling, layinâ back
Travel âround the whole world
Enjoying everywhere Iâm at
Meeting different people
Eating different food
No one like a gourmet meal
More than you

We spending all this money
Spending all this shine
Feeling all this high
Spending all this time
Iâm feeling better than ever before
This my life forâ¦ betterâ¦ or for
All this money
Spending all this shine
And itâs all so funny
Cause itâs all just fine
Iâm feeling better than ever before
This my life forâ¦ betterâ¦ or forâ¦ worse

They feel like they jealous
Everybody be thinkinâ that they was cool
Getting money since my mommy was dropping me off at school
Now I got a whip to cruise in
You the Pirates so you losinâ
Iâm in the news, you let them bring your news in
I bowl strikes you always leavinâ a few pins
I do me you keeping up with them new trends
I got fam you worried about makinâ new friends
Iâm in my pjâs you had to wear your suit in
Thinkinâ without doing, where, how, why me
Relax myself kick it like Ti chi
You could find me, only where Iâm at
There ainât no other meâs
They be checkinâ on my stats
Hi cat, find them up in a tree
Homie may be spittinâ bars they ainât fuckinâ with me
Iâm just turning up the heat to 100 degrees
Spittinâ like I got a razor blade stuck in my teeth

We spending all this money
Spending all this shine
Feeling all this high
Spending all this time
Iâm feeling better than ever before
This my life forâ¦ betterâ¦ or for
All this money
Spending all this shine
And itâs all so funny
Cause itâs all just fine
Iâm feeling better than ever before
This my life forâ¦ betterâ¦ or forâ¦ worse
