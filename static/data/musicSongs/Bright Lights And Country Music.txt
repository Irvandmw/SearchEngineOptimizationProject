Lyrics:


I won't stay home and cry tonight
Like all the nights before
I just learned that I don't really
Need you anymore
I found a little place downtown
Where guys like me can go
And they've got
Bright lights and country music

Bright lights and country music
A bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting
That there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me
What helped me forget so fast
I'll say those
Bright lights and country music

A table by the bandstand
A bottle filled with wine
Honky tonks were made for men
With women on their minds
And nothing else can take away
This loneliness of mine
Quite like those
Bright lights and country music

Bright lights and country music
A bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting
That there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me
What helped me forget so fast
I'll say those
Bright lights and country music
I love those
Bright lights and country music
