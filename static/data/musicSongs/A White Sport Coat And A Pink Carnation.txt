Lyrics:


I'm all dressed up for the dance

A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue blue mood

A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
But now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue blue mood

I'm all dressed up for the dance
