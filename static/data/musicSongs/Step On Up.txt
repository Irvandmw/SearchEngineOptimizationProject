Step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love

Hey, I'm classy but I don't mind if it get at me
It's okay to get nasty, just the way that you like
You say I'm sexy so bad they should arrest me
You can't forget me, gave you the time of your life

What you need, babe, is a number one
Can't you see, babe, I've got what you've been waiting for?
What you need, babe, is a work of art
What you need, babe, come get it, I got it

Step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love
Step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love

Hey, I'm waiting, standing here with my ladies
No shame in chasing if we got what you like
Don't stop, keep moving, 'cause I love what you doing
Let's rock to this music, have the time of your life

What you need, babe, is a number one
Can't you see, babe, I've got what you've been waiting for?
What you need, babe, is a work of art
What you need, babe, come get it, I got it

Step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love
Step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love

Don't be ashamed, any time, any place
Let him know that you got it like that
Love him real good, and you treat him like you should
You're gonna keep him coming right back
Don't be ashamed, any time, any place
Let him know that you got it like that
Love him real good, and you treat him like you should
You're gonna keep him coming right back

What you need, babe, is a number one
Can't you see, babe, I've got what you've been waiting for?
What you need, babe, is a work of art
What you need, babe, come get it, I got it

Step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love
Step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love

Don't be ashamed, any time, any place
Let him know that you got it like that
