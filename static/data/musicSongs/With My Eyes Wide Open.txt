Lyrics:


With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
Can it be true I'm holding you close to my heart
With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
You're with me now sharing a vow never to part

I'm so afraid to close my eyes afraid that I'll find
This lovely thrill is just a silly illusion
With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
Do I deserve such a break
Pinch me to prove I'm awake
I can't believe that you're really mine

With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming

With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
Can it be true I'm holding you close to my heart
With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
You're with me now sharing each vow never to part

I'm so afraid to close my eyes
Afraid that I'll find
This lovely thrill just a silly illusion
With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
Do I deserve such a break
Pinch me to prove I'm awake
I can't believe that you're really mine

With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
Do I deserve such a break
Pinch me to prove I'm awake
I can't believe that you're really mine
