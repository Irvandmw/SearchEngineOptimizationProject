Lyrics:


[Intro:]
Away aways, oh yea away away

This feels like the coldest day in a hurricane looking through a glass window
And ya screaming to the top of yours lungs, and the bells done rung
And the crowd can't hear you
And all that i can see is a building burning
I just gotta rescue my baby
But you don't even recognize me

And even though the feeling's been gone i just wanna be here
To pick up the little pieces of remains
I'm going down the plane is smoking
And the only one who can save me is you but you wanna throw me

[Chorus:]
Away, away, away, away, oh why
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me
Away, away, away, away, oh why
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away

You used to ask why i was i so skeptic, of love
Girls cuz it changes, and it ain't got to be no real season
You start to live the dream and before you know
There's a door that open, and the moment you walk in it close

Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help
Oh love, oh love, oh love, oh love
Just ain't what it used to be
I confronted my fears with open arms
Although you said you will never give up on us but now you blow me

[Chorus]

Perfect we said we'd never be
So why is this happening to me
No way no way (no way)

[Chorus]
