Lyrics:


The party's on the room is crowded
your conversation is so polite
And when you dance you keep your distance
noone's gonna walk you home tonight

You're searching for perfect love
you dreamed of when you were young
you'll find it or you won't have anyone

[Chorus:]
Why not forget your crazy dream
about a love that can't exist
'Coz while you dream so much you miss
you waste a lifetime

Just take a look below the surface
his golden hair will be turning grey
Though in your mind you pictured heaven
even heaven has a rainy day

No one can touch a dream
so forever you've been on your own
you're older and you are still all alone

[Chorus:]
Why not forget your crazy dream
about a love that can't exist
'Coz while you dream so much you miss
you waste a lifetime

Why don't you take a look around
now everyone has settled down
But you still think you're seventeen
It's a crazy dream

So take a chance and take your shot
No paradise but it's all we've got
and I will try to make your dream come true
