Lyrics:


I love you more, more than you know
I need you so I can't let you go
You're all I ever hoped and dreamed you'd be

I love you more, more than you know
I need you so, I want you to know
Everyday your love means more to me

Oh well you sure made it easy for me
To fall in love with you
The way you smiled at me
There wasn't much else I could do

I guess my resistance was low
I can't help wanting you so
Now every day I love you
I love you much more than you know

I love you more, more than you know
I need you so I can't let you go
You're all I ever hoped and dreamed you'd be

I love you more, more than you know
I need you so, I want you to know
Everyday your love means more to me

Oh well there's just no explaining
How you made me fall in love so fast
But you're the first girl I've loved
And I know you're gonna be the last

I think of you wherever I go
And my love for you is gonna grow
'Cause everyday I love you
I love you much more than you know

I love you more, more than you know
I need you so, I want you to know
You're all I ever hoped and dreamed you'd be

I love you more, more than you know
I need you so, I want you to know
Everyday I love you
I love you much more than you know

Everyday I love you
I love you much more than you know

Everyday I love you
I love you much more than you know
