Lyrics:


Well, we can't help but make it

Now that we've caressed
A kiss so warm and tender
I can't wait 'til we've reached
That sweet moment of surrender

We'll hear the thunder roar
Feel the lightening strike
At a point we both decided
To meet at the same time tonight

Hang on in there, baby
Hang on in there, darling
I'm gonna give you more
Than you ever dreamed possible

Don't be afraid, baby
Sweet virgin of the world
We can't help but make it
Because there's true love between us, girl

So, let us touch that cloud
Everyone dreams of
We're almost there, darling
We're truly making love

Hang on in there baby
Please don't let me down
Please don't destroy
This new joy we've found

What's that now, baby? What's that you say?
Something's eating at you and it's about to get away
Don't fight it, baby, you'd better open up the door
Cause that's the key to freedom that we've both been working for
Let it go, baby
Let it go, honey
Oh right there, right there
Baby don't you move it anywhere
Go baby, let it go, baby
Let it go honey
Oh right there, right there
Baby don't you move it, don't you dare

Hang on in there, baby
Hang on in there, darling
I'm gonna give you more
Than you ever dreamed possible
Hang on in there, baby
Please don't let me down
Please don't destroy
This new joy we've found

Hang on in there, baby
Hang on in there, darling
I'm gonna give you more
Than you ever dreamed possible
Hang on in there, baby
Please don't let me down
Please don't destroy
This new joy we've found
