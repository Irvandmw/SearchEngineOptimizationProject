Lyrics:


If my life gets like a jig saw
with the pieces out of place,
come on over,
put a smile back on my face.

And if all my bad days came at once
you would know just what to do.
Come on over;
baby, you will see me through.

And if you think I need you,
come on over.
Bring your love around;
you can dry away my tears.

And if you think I need you,
come on over.
Lay your body down;
you know I will be here.
So bring your love around.

When I can not see in front of me
you would know my darkest day,
come on over;
you can take it all away.

And if you think I need you,
come on over.
Bring your love around;
you can dry away my tears.

And if you think I need you,
come on over.
Lay your body down;
you know I will be here.
So bring your love around.

Come on over here.
