Lyrics:


Thirty more miles to San Diego
Thirty more miles and I'll be home
Thirty more miles to see my woman
Wonder is she's packed her things and gone
And it just don't pay to leave a woman alone too long
Thirty more miles of pushin' this diesel
How can such a short way seems so long
Someday I gonna comin' off that road boy
Find my sweet mama packed and gone
And it just don't pay to leave a woman alone too long
Darling it's not that I don't trust ye
I know what it means to be alone
Try your best to find your temptation
Your ever lovin' daddy's coming home
Thirty more miles to San Diego
Well I'm tired I'm weary to the bone
I have need of my sweet mama's good lovin'
I gotta make up all the time I've been gone
And it just don't pay to leave a woman alone too long
And it just don't pay to leave a woman alone too long
And it just don't pay to leave a woman alone too long
