Lyrics:


She believed in fairy tales and princes
He believed the voices coming from his stereo
He believed in rock and roll

She left her past and those lilly white fences
And headed out to hollywood in search of her soul
But she had to pay the toll (yes she did)

They were bound to find each other
He needed proof, she needed a brother
Thatâs when stars collide
When thereâs space for what you want
And your heart is open wide

Wait a minute

He gave up women for the stripes of the road
And learned the meaning of grace
Thatâs when his cup overflowed
And she said: âhelloâ

He said âmy faith keeps me from willinâ
But you know that Iâm able
And if thereâs some room
Iâd like to sit at your tableâ
She said âitâs tight, but I think I can fit you inâ

This kind of love donât come from a prayer
Ainât talking rebound, born of despair
Yellow sun rising on their bodies in bed
Two people in love, with nothing but the road ahead

Ah yeah, oh hoo
Oh oh oh oh ooh oooooh
Letâs go

She believed in fairy tales and princes
He believed in jazz, rhythm and blues
And this thing called soul
He believed in rock and roll
Hear me

She wanted to see her name appear on the big screen
He just wanted to hear her scream his name
Can you scream my name?
Do you know what I mean?

This kind of love donât come from a prayer
Ainât talking rebound, born of despair
Yellow sun rising on their bodies in bed
Two people in love with nothing but the road ahead

Rock, rock, love affair
Rock, rock, love affair
Rock, rock, love affair
