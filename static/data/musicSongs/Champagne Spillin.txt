Lyrics:


There'll be champagne spillin', champagne spillin'
Girls couch dancin' tonight
There'll be ratches spendin', ratches spendin'
Frontin', but the feeling is right
I got champagne on that ice, I got champagne on that ice
I got money on my mind, I got money on my mind

Party in like the [?] noon
Fuck, go to all robot tune
Lemme' tell you what you shall not do
Money talks, you are so not fluent
We'll meet on the other half
I'm so fly, homeground, I never land
I mean real fly, like Never-neverland
So don't ask wher' I'm goin', what the fuck are you doin'
Nigga lows, tell you that first
Came for the money, came for the purse
Came to move product, so I came with the merch
And if ya'll ain't scared, [?] flutes in the air, for the-

There'll be champagne spillin', champagne spillin'
Girls couch dancin' tonight
There'll be ratches spendin', ratches spendin'
Frontin', but the feeling is right
I got champagne on that ice, I got champagne on that ice
I got money on my mind, I got money on my mind

Fresh off the plane, I finally touch down
Feet landed, I firmly felt ground
Felt the wings of the aeroplane
'Cause I'm cut from the cloth of that very wing
Now that we got locs, now that we got locs
Now bring it back, bring it back like [?]
Now can you please show the world what you know most
It's water under the bridge, I'm a showboat
Nigga, That's Carlos SAINt JHN
Homie, that's Brooklyn's James Bond
Even with my tugs on, not in my 3-piece
I kill it [?], I kill it to [?]

There'll be champagne spillin', champagne spillin'
Girls couch dancin' tonight
There'll be ratches spendin', ratches spendin'
Frontin', but the feeling is right
I got champagne on that ice, I got champagne on that ice
I got money on my mind, I got money on my mind

I'm a hustler baby, you ain't over
Fa-fast money, Usain Bolt
Right of the block, where you can't go, so-
Whoever tear the hood, nigga don't drove
'Til the whole world scream my name
No other way, it's my name
Hear my hurt, feel my pain
I'm right out the broker, ain't never change
SAINt JHN
Momma give it up once
I said, Ma' lemme get you back one
Not every strings in the background
And dance in the moonlight
And think I didn't bless you

There'll be champagne spillin', champagne spillin'
Girls couch dancin' tonight
There'll be ratches spendin', ratches spendin'
Frontin', but the feeling is right
I got champagne on that ice, I got champagne on that ice
I got money on my mind, I got money on my mind
