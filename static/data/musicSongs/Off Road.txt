Lyrics:


So what you wanna do
You wanna do with me, babe
You got me in the mood
So what you wanna do now now now now
Do with me, babe
You got me in the mood

I'm always look for an adventure
Let's go somewhere we both haven't been
I need a change of scenery
I'm sick of lookin' at the same old shit

Don't care where you're takin' me
As long as you takin' me
Off road, off road, off road
Don't care where you're takin' me
As long as you takin' me
Off road, off road, off road

So what you wanna do
You wanna do to me, babe
You got me in the mood
So what you wanna do now now now now
Do to me, babe
You got me in the mood

Let's go off the beaten path
And get high off a different kind of risk
Don't need another party
No I'm sick of takin' all the same old shit

Don't care where you're takin' me
As long as you takin' me
Off road, off road, off road
Don't care where you're takin' me
As long as you takin' me
Off road, off road, off road

Don't care where you're takin' me
As long as you takin' me
Off road, off road, off road
Don't care where you're takin' me
As long as you takin' me
Off road, off road, off road
