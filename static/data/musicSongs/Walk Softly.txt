Lyrics:


Walk softly when you walk by me
'Cause my heart is still, don't shake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up, don't wake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up, don't wake it up (don't wake it up, don't wake it up, don't wake it up)

If I seem distant or reserved when we meet
Don't take the time to ask me why
'Cause it's bad enough that I've lost you, baby
Don't make it rough, just say hello and then tell me goodbye

Walk softly when you walk by me
'Cause my heart is still, don't shake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up, don't wake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up, don't wake it up (don't wake it up, don't wake it up, don't wake it up)

I fall apart each time that we meet
Remembering things that I should forget
My love's a spark but it could burst into flames
'Cause I'm not over you again, no

And walk softly when you move by me baby
'Cause my heart is still, don't you shake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up, don't wake it up, don't wake it up
Oh, now that I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up, don't wake it up, don't wake it up

Ooh, now that I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up, don't wake it up, baby, don't wake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up, let it late, baby, don't wake it up
Be charm baby, now that I've cried my love to sleep
Don't wake it up, don't wake it up, eh, don't wake it up

Please, baby, now that I've cried my love to sleep, let it late
Don't wake it up, don't wake it up, don't wake it up, don't wake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep
