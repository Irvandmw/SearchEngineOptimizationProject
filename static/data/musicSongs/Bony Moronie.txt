Lyrics:


Yeah
Oh

I got a girl named Bony Moronie
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
Got to see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat, just skin and bone

Huh

Well, now I love her and she loves me
Oh, how happy now we're gonna be
Making love underneath the apple tree, oh

Well, I told her mama and her papa, too
Just exactly what I'm gonna do
We're gonna get married on a night in June
Rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon

Well, yeah

Well, now I love her and she loves me
Oh, how happy now we're gonna be
Making love underneath the apple tree, hey
Huh hey, hey, hey

Well, she's my one and only, she's my hearts desire
She's a real up setter, she's a real live wire
Everybody's watching when my baby walks by
She's so good looking, really catches the eye

Huh oh
Yes
Let 'em in

Well, now I love her, she loves me
Oh, how happy now we're gonna be
Making love underneath the apple tree

Yeah, yeah, underneath the apple
Making love, yeah
Making love, making love, harder
Harder, harder, harder oh baby
