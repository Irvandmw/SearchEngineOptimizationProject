Yeah, uh, mmh

I'ma hundred billion dollar child, hoe
I was born to live this wild, yeah
Got a mill' stuffed in my house, hoe
Lean got a nigga on the ground, yeah
I'ma hundred billion dollar child, hoe
I was born to live this wild, yeah
Got a mill' stuffed in my house, hoe
Lean got a nigga on the ground, yeah

You know I got these bands from what I told you, hey (What I told you)
Hop in a foreign, blew, space coupe (Skrrt, skrrt)
You got lots of money they still gon' play you
You the type of nigga that be actin' fake too
I made a hundred bands just when I stepped in
Put some money in the safe, and brought the rest in
I just put some snowflakes on my necklace
He just went in debt, then why you flexin'? (Flexin')

I'ma hundred billion dollar child, hoe
I was born to live this wild, yeah
Got a mill' stuffed in my house, hoe
Lean got a nigga on the ground, yeah
I'ma hundred billion dollar child, hoe
I was born to live this wild, yeah
Got a mill' stuffed in my house, hoe
Lean got a nigga on the ground, yeah

Runnin' to the racks everyday, bands on me (Bands on me)
I just fucked yo' bitch first day, she was lonely (Lil' bitch)
Fuck what you gon' say, you don't know me
I threw bands her way, now she on me
Run and chase the bag, we gon' get a bag
You can't lie I'm the best that you had (Yeah)
Dropped five hundred, then made it back (Five hunnid)
I'm just tryna hit, girl, run it back (Oh)

I'ma hundred billion dollar child, hoe
I was born to live this wild, yeah
Got a mill' stuffed in my house, hoe
Lean got a nigga on the ground, yeah
I'ma hundred billion dollar child, hoe
I was born to live this wild, yeah
Got a mill' stuffed in my house, hoe
Lean got a nigga on the ground, yeah
