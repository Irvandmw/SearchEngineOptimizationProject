Lyrics:


[verse one]
rows of angels in the snow
hugs and kisses by the mistletoe
sugarplum fairies everywhere,must be that time of year
stars that shine on christmas trees
smoke that curls from chimineys
rednose reindeer taking flight and choir singing
O Holy Night

[chorus]
its the same old,same old christmas eve
its the same old christmas day
its the same old,same old christmas
but I like it, I like it that way

[verse two]
Another snowman with a button nose
presents all wrapped up in bows
friends and neighbors knockin at my door
like every christmas thats come before

[chorus]
its the same old,same old christmas eve
its the same old christmas day
its the same old, same old christmas 
but I like it, I like it that way

[bridge]
seasons keep on changin, the snow will melt away
but everything will be the same again, next year on christmas day
and I like it, I like it that way

[last verse]
rows of angels in the snow
hugs and kisses by the mistletoe
friends and neighbors knockin at my door
like every christmas thats come before

[chorus until music fades and ends]
