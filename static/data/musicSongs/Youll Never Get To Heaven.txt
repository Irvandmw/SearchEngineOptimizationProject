Lyrics:


La la la...

Daddy told me always to follow the golden rule
And he said that, Aretha, it's really a sin to be mean and cruel
So remember if you're untrue
Angels up in heaven are looking, looking at you, yeah, at the stars

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart, baby
So be very careful not to break my heart
You won't get to heaven if you, if you break my heart, ohoho...

La la la...

I've been hearing rumors all about how you play around (yes, I have)
And though I don't, I don't believe what I hear, baby, still it gets me down
If you ever should say goodbye
It will be so awful the angels would cry

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart, baby (baby)
So be very careful, honey, not to break my heart
You won't get to heaven if you, if you break my heart, ohoho...

La la la...

I can't hardly wait for the day when we say "I do" (ooh)
It's the day that I, I dreamed of so long, now it's coming true
You will promise to cherish me (yes, you will)
And, baby, if you break your promise, the angels, they can see, ooh, yeah

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart, baby (baby)
So you know you gotta be careful not to break my heart
You won't get to heaven if you, if you break my heart, ohoho...

La la la...
Everybody, la la la...

And I know you wanna go (yes, you do)
La la la...

If you're driving in your car, watch what you're doing and think
La la la...
