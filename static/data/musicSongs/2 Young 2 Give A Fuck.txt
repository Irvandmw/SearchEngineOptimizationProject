[Chris Brown:]
Yeah flow stupid
This is how I do it
Maybach flow nigga you are in the Buick
Your girl a doodoo momma
So you know I donât give 2 shits
Ainât no grey area
I just breed them blue pits

[Bow Wow:]
Niggas talk tough but they donât want it though
Confront it to your face and then Iâll tell your man that he a hoe
Bow Wizzle Iâm as real as it get
Iâm either getting money or boning a chick

[Chris Brown:]
Counting all this money
All these bottles we popping
In a club with the models
Got so many options
Nigga talk your shit
Yeah they hate me they watching
They know my flow ill
I be spitting and hulking, biatch
At 15 the Bentley was just a kidâs dream
Now these couple links got me speaking like Iâm European
A hundred thousand packed at the show in Manila
Then Iâm down in Africa where the kids are the killers
Got a mind of a king but a heart of a gorilla
You can imitate but ainât nobody realer

[Bow Wow:]
Yeah Iâm counting all this money
Milli for the Bugatti
And my girl ass thick like Buffy the body
And which one Iâma choose
I think her with the booze
I keep paper like the kid in elementary school
You know Iâm smoking on the finest
G5 to the islands
Iâm too fly yeah itâs like Iâm on autopilot
Man stop it Iâm way outta your league
See itâll take a lifetime to spend all this cheese
I got a new bitch for erryday of the week
Suck a nigga off til Iâm fast asleep

[Chris Brown:]
You know young riders is with us
Take it back to the hood
Screaming father forgive us
All my killers whatâs good
You know my flow is like murder
Go on give me a sentence
Got too many bars you think Iâm building a prison
Anything that I sing is a hit, car collision
How you got all that mouth and your heart is missing

[Bow Wow:]
Stop playing with me yâall lames to me
Me and Chris got our weight up
Better get your cake up
Like G&C get your weight up
Must step [?]
We the hottest doinâ it
Donât fuck with an act like you know whatâs up
