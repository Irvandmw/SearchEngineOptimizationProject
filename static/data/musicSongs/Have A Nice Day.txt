Lyrics:


Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand.
Is innocence the difference 'tween a boy and a man?
My daddy lived a lie. That's just the price that he paid.
Sacrificed his life just slavin' away.

Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,
That gets me through the night,
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my life.
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,
Standing on the ledge I show the wind how to fly.
When the world gets in my face,
I say,
"Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!"

Take a look around you. Nothing's what it seems.
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams.
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Of anybody brave enough to take a stand.
I've knocked on every door on every dead-end street
Looking for forgiveness and what's left to believe?

Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,
That gets me through the night,
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my life.
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,
Standing on the ledge I show the wind how to fly.
When the world gets in my face,
I say,
"Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!"

Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,
That gets me through the night,
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my life.
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,
Standing on the ledge I show the wind how to fly.
When the world gets in my face,
I say,
"Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!"

When the world keeps trying to drag me down,
Gotta raise my hand, gonna stand my ground.
I say,
"Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!"
