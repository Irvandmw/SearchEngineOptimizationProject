Lyrics:


The sun is out the sky is blue there's not a cloud to spoil the view
But it's raining raining in my heart
The weatherman says clear today he doesn't know you've gone away
And it's raining raining in my heart

Oh misery misery what's gonna become become of me
I tell my blues they mustn't show
But soon these tears are bound to flow
Cause it's raining raining in my heart

I tell my blues they mustn't show
But soon these tears are bound to flow
Cause it's raining raining in my heart
Raining in my heart
