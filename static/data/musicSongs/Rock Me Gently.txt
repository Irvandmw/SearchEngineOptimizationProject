Lyrics:


Nights have never felt so long
I, I sit around and wonder
Time never disappears
Like it's hanging around forever
Love, it's a losing game
The cards, they're all stacked against me
Dreams are never quite the same
How they use to rock me gently

Rock me gently all night long
Rock me gently 'til the dawn
Rock me 'til I'm fast asleep
Take away these memories, yeah

Light marching up the wall
Sleep, once again it left me
Night, does she care at all?
How she used to rock me gently

Rock me gently all night long
Rock me gently 'til the dawn
Rock me 'til I'm fast asleep
Take away these memories, ooh

Oh, rock me gently all night long
Rock me gently 'til the dawn
Rock me 'til I'm fast asleep
Take away these memories
