Lyrics:


(Who?... you!... Who?... you!
...Sweet adorable you!)

Who is the one, I couldn't do without
an' who is the one, I always think about?
In every little thing I do, nobody but you,
sweet adorable... you, you, you, you... (Who?)
Sweet adorable you!

Where do I go, when I need company,
an' who do I need, to make things right for me?
The one who makes my dreams come true, nobody but you,
sweet adorable... you, you, you, you... (Who?)
Sweet adorable you!

I'm such a lucky guy, an' that's the reason why,
I'll always be true...
There's not a minute of the day that can keep me away
from the love of sweet little you!

In every dream, you are the only one,
an' in every dream, I always seem to run
until I'm standin' there with you, nobody but you,
sweet adorable... you, you, you, you... (Who?)
Sweet adorable you!

(He's such a lucky guy, an' that's the reason why,
he'll always be true...)

There's not a minute of the day that can keep me away
from the love of sweet little you!

In every dream, you are the only one,
an' in every dream, I always seem to run
until I'm standin' there with you, nobody but you,
sweet adorable... you, you, you, you...
Sweet adorable you (you, you, you, you... who?)
Sweet adorable you!
