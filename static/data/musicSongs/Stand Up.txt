Lyrics:


Ooh aah
Album three ya'll
Ooh ahh
Blue
Ooh ahhOh I like what you do
Take the time out tonight
Let me hear you say ahh
And we can take it far
Gonna make you feel alright
Ohh same everyday
No fun no work and no play
Let me hear you say ahh
I know what you like
Take your time out tonight
I like it when you're close to me
'Cause you're making the most of me
And shorty you inspire me
To be all the man I can be
'Cause we roll like the sound of thunder
When it's only you and me
And can nobody take us under
'Cause the rest is history
Chorus
So everybody stand up
If you work all day
Maybe you deserve a little time to play
Hands up 
We're gonna feel alright
Take the time off tonight

Ohh don't leave the bedroom, stay by my side
Let me hear you say ahh
You shine like a star, brightly in my eyes
Ohh its a matter of fact
No change cause I'm happy like that (let me hear you say aah)
Leave the keys to your car you're staying with me tonight
I like it when you're close to me
'Cause you're making the most of me
And shorty you inspire me to be all the man I can be
'Cause we roll like the sound of thunder
When it's only you and me
And can nobody take us under
'Cause the rest is history
Chorus x 1

Try my best just to please ya
Don't leave me here 'cause I need ya
If you want I will tell ya (over and over again)
Try my best just to please ya
Don't leave me here cause I need ya
Look no further this is all we need
Ooh ahh
Ooh ahh

Let's get jiggy jiggy
I hope you feel me
So are you gonna give it to me?
We never spend no time to get busy busy
I wanna make the bed rock
And make you dizzy dizzy
Creep right up to your spot
So everybody stand up

If you work all day
Maybe you deserve a little time to play
Hands up
We're gonna feel alright
Take your time off tonight
'Cause we roll like the sound of thunder
When it's only you and me (you & me)
And can nobody take us under
'Cause the rest is history (rest is history)
So everybody stand up
'Cause we roll like the sound of thunder
When it's only you and me (you & me)
Hands up -
And can nobody take us under
'Cause the rest is history
So everybody stand up
Ooh ahh
Ooh aah
That's right
Hands up
Sing it again
So everybody stand up
Hands up
If you work all day baby you deserve a little time to play
Hands up 
We're gonna feel alright
Take your time off tonight

Take your time off tonight
