Lyrics:


Me and my shadow, 
Strolling down the avenue,  
Me and my shadow, 
Not a soul to tell our troubles to . . . 

And when it's twelve o'clock, 
We climb the stair,  
We never knock, 
For nobody's there . . .  

Just me and my shadow, 
All alone and feelin' blue . . .  

And when it's twelve o'clock, 
We climb the stair,  
We never knock, 
For nobody's there . . .  

Just me and my shadow, 
All alone and feelin' blue . . .
