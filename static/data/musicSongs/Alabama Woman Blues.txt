Lyrics:


Did you ever go down
On the Mobile and K C line

Did you ever go down
On the Mobile and K C line

I just want to ask you
Did you ever see that gal of mine

I rode the Central
And I hustled the L and N

I rode the Central
And I hustled the L and N

The Alabama women
They live like section men

Don't cry baby
Your papa will be home some day

Don't cry baby
Your papa will be home some day

I've been away baby
But I did not go to stay

Don't the clouds look lonesome
Across the deep blue sea

Don't the clouds look lonesome
Across the deep blue sea

Don't my gal look good
When she's coming after me
