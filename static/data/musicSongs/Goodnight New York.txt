Lyrics:


Morning comes crashing like a rock through a window
Jackhammer banging on the hot concrete
Take your stand (hey!)
Move it, man!
It's a backtalk, sidewalk symphony

Uber cars, yellow cabs, thick as smoke
Painted girls and meter maids will leave you broke
Sax man blowing shootin' through my veins
There's a rhythm to the rocket that's intoxicating

Goodnight New York goodnight
Don't ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Your face, your brains
No other place
From east to west, these streets are blessed
Goodnight New York 
Sleep tight New York
Goodnight

Starbucks, FedEx trucks on every street and avenue
Broadway lights, shining bright, make everybody beautiful
Walking on the high line, reaching for the sky line
If Alexander Hamilton could see it all
Garbage trucks backing up
Beep, beep, beep
Dogs barking on the balcony
The kids can't sleep
Scaffolds, pot holes, bagman's on a bicycle
Fast trains, bus, planes
Welcome to the carnival

Goodnight New York goodnight
Don't ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Your face, your brains
No other place
From east to west, these streets are blessed
Goodnight New York 
Sleep tight New York
Goodnight

The bravest and the finest
My hand's on my heart for you
To the ones who paid the price
And to those who saw us through
It's late, I'm gettin' weary
So, for now, I'll say

Goodnight New York goodnight
Don't ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice

Goodnight New York goodnight
Don't ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Your face, your brains
No other place
From east to west, these streets are blessed
Goodnight New York 
Sleep tight New York
Goodnight

Ah, goodnight, New York
Sleep tight, New York
Goodnight

So goodnight, New York
Sleep tight, New York
Goodnight
