Lyrics:


I never met anotherone
Who made my life so much fun
'cos every moment I'm with you
I never know what you're gonna do

Every day you change your mind
Do something different all the time
Life is a game you wanna play
Twentyfour hours a day
It's funny how

[Chorus:]
You keep me running going and coming
I like the feeling it's out of control
There's no denying you send me flying
I'm hoping you catch me when I fall

You drive me crazy but I don't mind
Someone like you is hard to find
I like the way you're moving around
In your world everything is upside down

Every day you change your mind
Do something different all the time
Life is a game you wanna play
Twentyfour hours a day
It's funny how

[Chorus:]
You keep me running going and coming
I like the feeling it's out of control
There's no denying you send me flying
I'm hoping you catch me when I fall
