Lyrics:


I'm comin' home, I've done my time, 
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine, 
If you received my letter, 
Tellin' you I'd soon be free, 
Then you'll know just what to do, 
If you still want me... 

If you still want me... 

Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree, 
It's been three long years, 
Do you still want me? (still want me?) 
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree, 
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, 
Put the blame on me... 

If I don't see a yellow ribbon around the ole oak tree... 

Bus driver please look for me, 
'Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see, 
I'm really still in prison, 
And my love, she holds the key, 
Simple yella ribbon's, what I need to set me free... 

I wrote and told her please... 

Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree, 
It's been three long years, 
Do you still want me? (still want me?) 
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree, 
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, 
Put the blame on me... 

If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree... 

Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree, 
...three long years, 
...still want me? 
And now the whole damn bus is cheerin' 
And I can't believe I see... 

A hundred yellow ribbons 'round the ole... 
The ole oak tree! 

Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree, 
Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree, 
Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree...
