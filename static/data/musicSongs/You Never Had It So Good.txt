Lyrics:


The life and land around you is good, so good, so good.
You never had it so good, you never had it so good,
You never had it so good, you never had it so good,
You never had it so good, sister,
Smiles of happy faces, different styles and races,
Still we're one big neighborhood.
You never, I mean never, ever had it so good, so good, so good, so good.
Ice cream on your apple pie, that's good, that's good.
Mountain streams of fish fry, yum yum, that's good.
Flag that you can wave about, that's good, that's good.
A wide spread you can see right outside good, that's good.
What our forefathers said still goes, any American knows,
You never had it so good, you never had it so good,
You never had it so good, you never had it so good,
You never had it so good, sister,
Smiles of happy faces, different styles and races,
Still we're one big neighborhood.
You never, I mean never, ever had it so good, so good, so good, so good.
The corn upon the splendid plain, that's good, that's good.
And frozen foods in cellophane, that's good, that's good,
A hot dog in a bleacher's seat, that's good, that's good,
A town hall where the people meet, that's good, that's good.
Old John Hancock, he said it fine, he put it right on the line,
You never had it so good, you never had it so good,
You never had it so good, you never had it so good,
You never had it so good, sister,
Smiles of happy faces, different styles and races,
Still we're one big neighborhood.
You never, I mean never, ever had it so good, so good, so good, so good.
Not ever!
