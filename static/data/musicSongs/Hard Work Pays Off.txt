Lyrics:


They say hard work pays off
I've been feelin' paid off
Tryna take it, then you're dead, Nate Dogg
Put this chopper to your head
And, and take it off
Fast break, takin' off
Dunk on a bitch, John Wall (Woah, woah)
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair
Throwin' elbows
This a AK, yeah
Bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blowin' all on my red coins

Tell that ho I'm rich, rich, rich, rich, rich
I'm richer than a bitch, bitch, bitch, white bitch
Blue face everywhere
Pull up, they stare
Fendi, my underwear
She saw my dick, she like "damn"
I need me a money counter, counter
Money all over the kitchen counter, counter
I think I need me a money counter, counter
Money all over the kitchen counter, counter

Call my doctor to heal my pain
Perkys takin' my life away
I'ma bag your bitch, because I can
I'ma go take your wife away
Chopper on me, Afghanistan
That bitch killed many men
Over the bag, over the cash
Yeah, I'm a money fan

Over the bag, on your ass
Yeah, hoppin' out the van
Switched up to the Lamb'
How you niggas like me now? (Yeah)
No Limit the gang
Try it, they gon' shoot you down (Yeah)
Loaded up, and I'm gunnin' you down

They say hard work pays off
I've been feelin' paid off
Tryna take it, then you're dead, Nate Dogg
Put this chopper to your head
And, and take it off
Fast break, takin' off
Dunk on a bitch, John Wall (Woah, woah)
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair
Throwin' elbows
This a AK, yeah
Bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blowin' all on my red coins

They say hard work pays off
I've been feelin' paid off
Drippin' on 'em every day, steak-sauce
Put the chopper to your head, take it off
Fast lane, takin' it off
Breakin' your ankle, Chris Paul
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so on, right now my legacy will never fade
I've been traumatized before, but still I'm not afraid
I done seen friends turn foe, it don't amaze me
Came from the bottom of the 'crete, this shit was ugly
Made it to the top of the mountain drankin' muddy
Everyone around me changed, and I feel so neglected
Hoppin' on the bird with some birds, they respect it (Yeah, yeah)
24/7, every day we get it in (Yeah)
Started livin' out my dreams, feel like I was born again (Aye)

They say hard work pays off
I've been feelin' paid off
Tryna take it, then you're dead, Nate Dogg
Put this chopper to your head
And, and take it off
Fast break, takin' off
Dunk on a bitch, John Wall (Woah, woah)
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair
Throwin' elbows
This a AK, yeah
Bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blowin' all on my red coins
