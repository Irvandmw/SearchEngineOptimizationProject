Lyrics:


Ounce of love is all I need
To fly with an angel
While the dealers die for it
The kush burn like bullets, both Iâm chasin the green
Iâm chiefin, seein

Time after time
Girl I need that strong shit
Top of the line
You know that stick icky wrong shit
You know there might be a time
Pretty young thing
Baby just try this
I got all the flavors
Got you fienin'

Oh oh
Girl I got you warming up so take off them clothes
We can do it anywhere
Have one cup, letâs go
Hallucinating this hit will make you see your ghosts
Youâre mine, itâs alright

You said that you ainât smoke in a while baby
So we gon' fuck and Iâmma roll up
Itâs getting loud, blowing on that loud girl
Baby Iâmma work you out girl, work you out girl
I love you, Mary Jane

Iâmma break it down, baby lick you like a swisha
Homie light that shit on fire, Mary Jane Iâm poppin wit ya
Iâm a hot box in your hot box
You just take it like a picture
Iâmma go slower and slower
So high you flyin baby
Iâmma break it down, baby lick you like a swisha
Iâmma break it down, l-l-lick you like, lick you like
Iâmma break it down, baby lick you like a swisha
Iâmma break it down, baby so high weâre flyin yea

You so high, you fine baby
Smoke that shit, better give me a light
My private jet red eye baby
Give it to you good, beat it up
Yo pussy is a crybaby
Donât stop, take it to the head
Yea yea

And Iâm putting in work, that 9 to 5 baby
Coming round, you smoking brown
Let me bust that, switch you out baby
That white girl, them white papers
Letâs roll up, roll up
Iâm off that green, she off that molly
I need a bottle of water
And everything good, the kitty got smilin

Oh oh
Girl I got you warming up so take off them clothes
We can do it anywhere
Have one cup, letâs go
Hallucinating this hit will make you see your ghosts
Youâre mine, itâs alright

You said that you ainât smoke in a while baby
So we gon fuck and Iâmma roll up
Itâs getting loud, blowing on that loud girl
Baby Iâmma work you out girl, work you out girl
I love you, Mary Jane

Iâmma break it down, baby lick you like a swisha
Homie light that shit on fire, Mary Jane Iâm poppin wit ya
Iâm a hot box in your hot box
You just take it like a picture
Iâmma go slower and slower
So high you flyin baby
Iâmma break it down, baby lick you like a swisha
Iâmma break it down, l-l-lick you like, lick you like
Iâmma break it down, baby lick you like a swisha
Iâmma break it down, baby so high weâre flyin yea

Okay, hold up Iâm bout to roll up
I got a pint, gon mix it with the Sprite, let me pour up
Hell of a night, 100 million dollar yacht
Never paid for the pussy but after this you gon owe us
Stick on the dick but donât throw up
Break it down, bend you over
Always be, Iâm off the THC
I guarantee that bitch nigga wonât show up
Iâmma make the bitch box box
Nigga to yo look style, we gon pull up at Snoopâ house
Smoke it by the ounce (ounce), a nigga be too high
Man youâre star struck, kinda fucked
Iâmma go HAM when Iâm in it
I throw 100 bands when Iâm winnin
What you sayin? Itâs a limit?
She on my shoulder, getting closer
Now she a changed small

Iâmma break it down, baby lick you like a swisha
Homie light that shit on fire, Mary Jane Iâm poppin wit ya
Iâm a hot box in your hot box
You just take it like a picture
Iâmma go slower and slower
So high you flyin baby
Iâmma break it down, baby lick you like a swisha
Iâmma break it down, l-l-lick you like, lick you like
Iâmma break it down, baby lick you like a swisha
Iâmma break it down, baby so high weâre flyin yea

Yeah, yeah wild
Yeah, yeah wild
Yeah, yeah wild
Yeah, yeah wild
