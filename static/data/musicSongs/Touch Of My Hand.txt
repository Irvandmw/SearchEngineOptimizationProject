Lyrics:


Iâm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
Iâm going to places I can be out of control

And I donât want to explain tonight
All the things Iâve tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and Iâll teach myself to fly

I love myself
Itâs not a sin
I canât control whatâs happeninâ

âCause I just discovered
Imaginationâs taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

From the small of my back and the arch of my feet
Lately Iâve been noticinâ the beautiful me
Iâm all in my skin and Iâm not gonna wait
Iâm into myself in the most precious way

And I donât want to explain tonight
All the things Iâve tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and Iâll teach myself to fly

âCause I just discovered
Imaginationâs taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

Thereâs a world undefined
In my body and mind 
I wonât be left behind
Iâm already here

âCause I just discovered
Imaginationâs taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

âCause I just discovered
Imaginationâs taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
