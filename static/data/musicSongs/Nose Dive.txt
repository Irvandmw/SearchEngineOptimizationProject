[Chris Brown:]
Hey

Turn the lights on if you're afraid of the dark
Pay it forward dusk 'til dawn, death do us part
See the moonlight and sun rays above, between us two (Huh)
We are shooting stars, one red, one blue

Don't blink, you'll miss the chance
It's deep inside
All these fireworks, anticipation
A new revelation
Freedom, without a care
What I've been hit by? Cupid struck me first
I'll glide, nose dive

Are you ready for life?
Be prepared, it won't come twice
Love will finally find us
The more you give, the more you feel
Just be prepared for the lights, ooh, ooh

I'm runnin' out, on my way
I'm right in town, wait for me
Hands to the sun, that's alright
Do it all, do it

[DaniLeigh:]
I owe you (Yeah)
It's just the way you make me feel (Alright)
Them other ones, they ain't for real (Alright)
You know I'm gonna ride for you
Of course, of course (Yeah, yeah)
I'm never switching sides on you (Hey, hey)
Your flaws and all (Yeah)
'Cause I always find some time for my baby (Yeah)
Time for my baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Relax and just spend time with me, baby (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Time with me, baby, yeah (Yeah)
And I admit the way you love me, feelin' like you drove me, yeah (Yeah)
And you ain't gotta rent it 'cause you own me, just go pull up on me, yeah

[Chris Brown:]
Don't blink, you'll miss the chance
It's deep inside
All these fireworks, anticipation
A new revelation
Freedom, without a care
What I've been hit by? Cupid struck me first
I'll glide, nose dive

Are you ready for life?
Be prepared, it won't come twice
Love will finally find us
The more you give, the more you feel
Just be prepared for the lights, ooh, ooh

I'm runnin' out, on my way
I'm right in town, wait for me
Hands to the sun, that's alright
Do it all, do it
