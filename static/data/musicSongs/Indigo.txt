Lyrics:


Hol' up
what you want to do tonight
What you got for me to try?
Baby, what you want to do tonight?
What you got for me to try?
OG Parker

Should I hit the town? (Ayy)
Pull up at the strip (Skrrt, skrrt, ayy)
Fuck up a check, yeah
Show 'em how I live, yeah
Link on my neck (Link on my neck), I got 'em on deck (I got 'em on deck)
But they don't know you already at the crib
'Cause you nasty, babe
You do everythin' I like
But you classy, babe
And your spirit, just my type
Oh, you nasty, babe
You do everythin' I like
Yeah, you nasty, babe
You nasty, baby
Frequency, you freaky when we in the bed
Yoga, fit pilate body, shawty, yeah
I can spot your curves with no infrared
Level to me, baby, open my third eye
That's my baby, she woke
She my little cheat code
When I'm with her, we grow
I found my light
In the way that she glow
Now wherever I go
I look around and the colors so bright

Green, rolled up in leaves
Yellow mood ring
Purple light like a beam
I dream in indigo

Baby, what you wanna do tonight? (Yeah, yeah, ayy)
What you got for me to try? (Baby, ah)
We ain't letting shit fuck up our vibe, no
Pussy fire, it's a vibe, times ten

'Cause you nasty, babe
You do everythin' I like
But you classy, babe
And your spirit, just my type
Oh, you nasty, babe
You do everythin' I like
Yeah, you nasty, babe
You nasty, baby
Frequency, you freaky when we in the bed
Yoga, fit pilate body, shawty, yeah
I can spot your curves with no infrared
Level to me, baby, open my third eye
That's my baby, she woke
She my little cheat code
When I'm with her, we grow
I found my light
In the way that she glow
Now wherever I go
I look around and the colors so bright

Green, rolled up in leaves
Yellow mood ring
Purple light like a beam
I dream in indigo (Ow!)

I still believe that we don't die (No, we don't)
So many questions, don't know why-y-y
I think I knew you in my other life
When I'm with you, I feel alive
(Baby girl, you're open)

Open my third eye (Ayy)
That's my baby, she woke (Ooh)
She my little cheat code (Whoa)
When I'm with her, (When I'm with her) we grow (We go)
I found my light
In the way that she glow (Ooh, yeah)
Now wherever I go (Ooh)
I look around and the colors so bright

Green, rolled up in leaves (Oh)
Yellow mood, ring (Ooh, no no)
Purple light like a beam (See what that purple like)
I dream in indigo

Baby, what you want to do tonight?
What you got for me to try?
Baby, what you want to do tonight?
What you got for me to try?
