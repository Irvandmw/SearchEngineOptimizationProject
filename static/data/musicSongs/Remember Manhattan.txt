Lyrics:


Nothing worth a damn
Can be sifted through the brain
Sense don't make the
Man
But you insist on being sane
Don't take time to
Think
Or you're done before
You start
There's no missing link

Cause it's right there
In your heart
Take a closer look,
There's an answer not a
Question
In that may-december line
You'll bite a bigger
Hook
Than the one you want to leave behind
Remember manhattan
Woody wasn't wrong

Remember manhattan
Before you say so long
How you gonna tell
If it stands the test of time
There's no wishing well

That comestrue without the dime
It's a common curse
That the grass is always greener
No matter what you have
But nothing could be worse
Than to try to reproduce the past

Remember manhattan
Woody wasn't wrong

Remember manhattan
Before you say so long
Remember manhattan
What did woody say
He said, remember manhattan
Before you walk away
Lose your common sense
'cause you may not get the chance again
