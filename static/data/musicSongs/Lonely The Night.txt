Lyrics:


All I had is gone now
Goodbye fell too hard and too soon
One more night until tomorrow to get through
Talking to your shadow in my room

All the stars are crying
They know they broke their promise to me
Once upon a time, I wished for a love like you
But I guess sometimes wishes don't come true

Broken hearts live alone
No one sees, no one knows what they know

Lonely the night
Lonely the night
Only the night belongs to those who've lost their love

Time can heal, so they tell me
I don't think I'll be that long
One more night feels like eternity right now
Every passing minute pulls me down

Empty arms could never hold
No one sees, no one knows what they know

Lonely the night
Lonely the night
Only the night belongs to those who've lost their love

Lonely the night
Lonely the night
Only the night belongs to those who've lost their love

Lonely the night
Lonely the night
Lonely the night
Lonely the night
