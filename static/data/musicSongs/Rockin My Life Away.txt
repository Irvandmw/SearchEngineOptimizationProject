Lyrics:


I lived 14, 95 and 19, 48
I throwed a rock and roll party on my last birthday
But it's good, 'cause I'm rockin' my life away
My name is Jerry Lee Lewis
And I'm durned sure here to stay

I said streamline, fleetline, or military brass
You know the general's daughter
But The Killer's top class
Oh, I'm rockin'
Hey, I'm rockin' my life away
Hey! I love to Rock 'N' Roll
And I'm here
And I'm here to stay
Yeah!

Play it Jimmy!

Ho!

Well, ya better get up off your humper
Don't you know that's what I think
'Cause I'm a mean piano-mother-humper 

Shakin' off my fingers and rockin'
Honey, my life away-e
Hey! 
Lord knows, Jerry Lee Lewis is here to stay
Alright!

I said rock
They call it Rock n' Roll, baby
Rock n' Roll
It's here to stay
I really don't, really don't, really don't
Give a damn what they say

Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On
It's good enough for Jerry Lee
Great Ball of Fire, mama
Hang it in with me

Oh, I'm here to stay
Jerry Lee, he heats, Louisiana, Mississippi
Makes no difference, Tennessee
Oh Lord!

Ho!
