Song Name: That's When He Told Her
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Streetlight
yellow in the room
lifting out our futures from the gloom
same song 
in the street below
football song that everybody knows

[Chorus]
That's when he told her
that he loved her
and he'd love her all his life - [2x]

bright lights
five years down the lane
point to where the just born babies cry
he knows now
they are joined for good
life could never break them
nothing could

[Chorus 2x]

30 years pass like a sonic boom
sunlight floods into a different room
they both know they're saying goodbye too soon
but there's no more time

[Chorus]

that's when he told her
that he meant it when he 
said he loved her
and he'd love her all his life
