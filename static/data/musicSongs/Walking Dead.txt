Lyrics:


Everybody told me
Everybody told me that this would happen
I didn't wanna believe
Didn't wanna believe that you were right
I was so caught up
Caught up in a world that I cut you out of
And now I'm hating myself
I'm hating myself
I never should've shut you out

We are the walking dead
Swallow the lies we're fed
Uncover your eyes
Uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize
We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead

It might take some time
But I really think we can start things over
Take a look out our lives
Take a look at how fucked up we've become
In the bloodshot eyes
All I see is pain and devastation
And now I'm hating myself
I'm hating myself
I never should've shut you out

We are the walking dead
Swallow the lies we're fed
Uncover your eyes
Uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize
We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead

Can anything bring us back to life
Will anything make us right
Can anything bring us back to life
I'm willing to make us right
Cause the further that we're falling apart
The more that it breaks my heart

We are the walking dead
Swallow the lies we're fed
Uncover your eyes
Uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize
We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead
Uncover your eyes
Uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize

We are the walking dead
Swallow the lies we're fed
Uncover your eyes
Uncover your eyes
Uncover the truth and you'll realize
We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead

We are the walking dead
