Lyrics:


Yo
I'm just a girl from a small town
just spreading my love around 
But I should be up in LA 
or along doing Jessie J 

I wanna sing with Beyonce
wanna spit that volume like Lil' Wayne 
And I can do any genre,
Just tell me that you wanna wanna

Lay that beat down while I sing along
yeah we can part till dawn
rage all night until the morning
Write a chorus and a verse or two
But if you knew the truth

I always wish that I could 
Dance like Madonna yeah
Shake it like Rihanna 
Have them curves like Nikki
And the voice of Ricky

Have that swagger like T-Pain
Yo I could go insane
Throw some glitter in the air
Have Kesha's crazy hair

And no matter where I go
They're on my radio,
Showing me the ways to mind my great escape
Since I was young I felt that bass and drum
It was always clear to me this is who I wanna be, what

See I was born for this
cause I felt's in my finger tips, that's right
Writing like I was Taylor Swift 
And may be she can lay a verse on this

And I could go to the Grammy's
holding hands with Adele and the family
But I gotta get the one hit song
And you can come along if we just

Lay that beat down while I sing along
Yeah we can party till dawn
Haters gonna hate but we can prove them wrong yo
Write the chorus and a verse or two, but if you only knew

I always wish that I could
Dance like Madonna
Shake it like Rihanna
Have them curves like Nikki
And the voice of Ricky

Have that swagger like T-Pain
I could go insane
Throw some glitter in the air
Have Kesha's crazy hair

And no matter where I go
They're on my radio yeah yo
Showing my the ways to mind my great escape, what

Since I was young 
I felt that bass and drum
It was always clear to me 
this is who I wanna be

Doesn't matter where I go no
Because I know yeah
Who I'll always be yeah 
I'm gonna be me wooh

Doesn't matter where I go 
Doesn't matter where it's to
I'll still be me but you
you know that you wish you could

Dance like Madonna
Shake it like Rihanna
Have them curves like Nikki
And the voice of Ricky

Have that swagger like T-Pain 
I could go insane
Throw some glitter in the air
Have Kesha's crazy hair 

And no matter where I go
They're on my radio, that's right
Showing my the ways to mind my great escape what 

Since I was young 
I felt that bass and drum
It was always clear to me 
this is who I wanna be

See I was born for this
cause I felt's in my finger tips tips tips tips tips...
This is who I wanna be
