Lyrics:


[Verse 1]
I knew you before
Took a lifetime to forget
But as my eyes meet yours
I take all I can get
They light up the shadows of my heart
Return stolen works of art
Yet, you canât discern this moment's grace

[Hook:]
But I still remember you
In that big, old, white Suburban
And although you look right past me
With disregard
The first won't happen twice

[Verse 2]
My gaze shifts to the ground
More alone than I was then
I have searched your eyes
But they donât comprehend
I crawl back into the shadows of my heart
And just sit there in the dark
Where you donât requite the love you still take

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
And although Iâve since moved on
And Iâve been in love a few times
Thereâs still a piece of me
That holds on to you
âCause the first wonât happen twice
It wonât happen twice
It wonât happen twice

I remember you
In that big, old, white Suburban
And although you look right past me
With disregard
And although Iâve since moved on
And Iâve been in love a few times
Thereâs still a piece of me
That canât let go of you
âCause the first wonât happen twice
