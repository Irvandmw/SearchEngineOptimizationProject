Lyrics:


Let me run this by you...

I know that you've been jivin' me
And you're cold as you can be
But I leave room for something real
Is it something that you ever feel?
You don't live up to the expected
And your true feelings you've neglected
Don't worry about it, your love I can do without it
Move over baby 'cause you're really in the way
Something really good's gonna happen today
If you can't dig on me and really bring it home
Try being a man on you very own

If your love is not for me, at least use some integrity
Why don't you use some integrity?

I know that you got your daddy's way
But your daddy's day was yesterday
Time has moved on and things have changed
Ladies' priorities re-arranged
You wanna be appreciated
What you give is so underrated
Well
One would think there was no one but you
And you're the very thing to make you blue
Do I make you feel insecure?
Do you need control?
Would it help you just to know
You've won my heart and you're on a roll

It ain't been told a woman's love as sweet as mine
You're a star and I help you shine
There's a good woman behind every man
Let's go from one and revise the plan
Do the do for me

And it ain't been told a woman's love as sweet as mine
You're a star and I help you shine
There's a good woman behind every man
Let's go from one and revise the plan

And if your love is not for me, at least use some integrity
Come on
Why don't you use some integrity?

Put the word in your vocabulary
Look it up in you dictionary
Don't run your jive on me
Well you wanna be trusted
But your show been busted

You think ladies are toys
I like the big boys
Yes I do
With integrity

Talkin' about non-commital
All that is, my man, is about givin' a lot for a little
Integrity...
