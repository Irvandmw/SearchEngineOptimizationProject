Lyrics:


Princess, painless
Empty pillowcases
One love too blind
I held you, felt you
Shook you past I love yous
My scars, your lies
Oh cause I

Kept believing every word you said
Wrapped up in every kiss you poisoned
I could swear I never tasted sin
But If I just knew

I'll forget what you've done
But I can't save your soul
I won't preach, I won't judge
Save your soul
You could get on your knees
But I can't save your soul
Baby, just let me be

Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul

Black tears streaming
No more slick concealing
No trust, no love
Now I can't hear you
No, I don't need even know you
Doors shut, case closed

How could I
Keep believing every word you said
Wrapped up in every kiss you poisoned
I could swear I never saw the sin
But If I just knew

I'll forget what you've done
But I can't save your soul
I won't preach, I won't judge
Save your soul
You could get on your knees
But I can't save your soul
Baby, just let me be

Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul

I'll forget what you've done
But I can't save your soul
I won't preach, I won't judge
Save your soul
You could get on your knees
But I can't save your soul
Baby, just let me be

Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
Baby I can't save your soul
I can't save your soul
