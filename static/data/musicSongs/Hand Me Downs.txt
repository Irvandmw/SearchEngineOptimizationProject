Lyrics:


I'm thinking maybe I should thank you
Oh baby, I should buy you another round
'Cause you care and I'm swear that I'm here
But I'm there, it's getting harder to hold me down
Get away to a place with a lake, such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hundred thou'
I made it but hey, once I build it I break it
That might just break me down

And all l ever needed was somebody
With some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember
I been keeping it together, but I'm feeling strange

Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit
And the screws, they go missing
Slightly, they might be, but

You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
Knew damn-well our great design
You despite being an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down
Down, down, down
And down, down
Down, down, down

Yeah, well I'm just being honest my conscience ain't doing bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turning till the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie, though facts may seem a little far-fetched
That's only 'cause I've made me make believe I'm full darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and hard place
Walking, dropping change inside your empty guitar case, that's charity, um
I move carelessly, that's why I'm always tripping
I guess it's like electrolytes, you help me go the distance
Not too efficient, but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit
And screws, they go missing
Slightly, they might be, but

You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
Knew damn-well our great design
You despite being an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down
Down, down, down
And down, down
Down, down, down
