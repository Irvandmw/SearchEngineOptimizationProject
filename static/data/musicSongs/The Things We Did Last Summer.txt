Song Name: The Things We Did Last Summer
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The boat rides we would take
The moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite song
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The midway and the fun
The kewpie doll we won
The bell I rang to prove that I was strong
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike
The rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back

The leaves begin to fade like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong
That things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

(The early morning hike
The rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back)

The leaves begin to fade like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go so wrong
That things that we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long
