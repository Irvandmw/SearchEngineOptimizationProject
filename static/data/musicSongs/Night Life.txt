Lyrics:


In the evening, when the sun goes down
Youâre gonna find me, doinâ 
what Iâm doinâ right now, and next just sitting around
The night life, it ainât no good life
But itâs my life, yes it is

And all good people, good people, just like you and me
Theyâre sitting around dreaming
Sitting around dreaming about that used to be
Well, the night life, ask anybody if that it ainât no good life
But thatâs alright because itâs my life, oh, yes it is

Oh, listen to the blues, to the blues and what theyâre playing
I wonder tonight, are you really listening to the blues
To the blues and what theyâre saying
What they seem to be playing to me thatâs, that many people have loved
And they seem to be saying to me that many people have lost
Well, listen, they might not to have loved at all
If they had know that they couldnât pay the cost

Oh, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me
They tell me that life is just an empty scene
They say that is older than the oldest broken hearts
And they tell me that is newer than the newest stood dreams
Well, the night life, what Iâm doinâ right now ainât no good life
But thatâs alright with me, because itâs my life, yes it is
I tell you that the night life sure ainât no good life
Well, but itâs my life, yes it is, yeah
