Lyrics:


I never had no regrets boys not for nothin' I've done
I owed the devil some debts boys paid 'em all up but one
And I don't even regret the livin' that I'll be leaving behind
I've gotten weary of searching for something I couldn't find

I'm going down to the shade by the river one more time
And feel the breeze on my face before I die
I'm gonna leave whatever's left of my luck for the losers
And then bend down kiss the world goodbye

Come to lucky-in-lovin' I never had no complains
They never said I was evil but then I wasn't no saint
I'm just a river that rolled forever and never got to the sea
I just ain't blamin' nobody I had it coming to me

I'm going down to the shade by the river one more time...
I never had no regrets boys not for nothin' I've done...
