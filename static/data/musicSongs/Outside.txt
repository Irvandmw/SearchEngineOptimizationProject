Lyrics:


[Verse 1]
Iâll let you show me his moves
Let you do what he taught you
Let you reminisce how you used to do
Girl Iâm open to anything thatâll get you into that zone
And understand that weâre all alone
So you can slowly take off your clothes
Baby girl you know whatâs in store
Baby I will stay up all night
And Iâve been goinâ hard since last night
And Iâmma go harder tonight
Wish you can see you through my eyes
Ooh Iâm tellinâ you this ainât the same
And I know heâs still in your brain
Iâm âbout to burn that shit into flames
Once Iâm in you
Baby

[Hook]
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
âCuz baby when Iâm finished with ya you wonât wanna go
Outside

[Verse 2]
And Iâmma work you like a pro, baby
And, you gonâ take it like one
Yeah you gonâ take it like one
And Iâmma give it like you asked for it
Why, cuz you been talkinâ âbout it
I know you been talkinâ âbout it
Ooh baby when Iâm done with you, why
You ainât sayin nothinâ
Yeah you ainât sayin nothinâ
Ooh baby when Iâm done with you, why
You ainât sayin nothinâ
Yeh you ainât sayin nothinâ
You gonâ make me show off
All the pain that you feel you can tell that we ainât makin no love
But Iâll pretend
Oh girl, Iâll pretend
If you pretend then girl Iâll pretend
Letâs make it seem like weâre all we need in the end

[Hook]
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
âCuz baby when Iâm finished with ya you wonât wanna go
Outside
