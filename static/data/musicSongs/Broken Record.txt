Lyrics:


It was summer love, 
She was like a drug, 
Fit me like a glove, 
Everything was alright, 

I was James Dean, 
She was Billie Jean, 
California Queen, 
Everything was alright, 

From the bad beat, 
To the back scene, 
In the heat heat, 
Everything was alright, 

[Pre-Chorus:]
Lovers and years have come and gone, 
She'll always be my favorite song
She was solid gold, 
She was Rock'n'roll
I should have never let her go go go

[Chorus:]
Kiss me goodbye and I knew it was final, 
Got in her daddy's car and she was gone like vinyl, 
Her memory pops up when I least expect it, 
It's stuck in my head like a broken record, 
Pa pa pa pa pa Broken Record, 
P-p-pa pa pa Broken record, 
A broke, a broke, a broken record, 
P-p-pa pa pa Broken record, 

She was hot file, 
She was low file, 
Burning up July, 
Everything was alright, 

Let me with a kiss, 
I wonder where she is, 
If that she ever miss me, 
Oh oh oh, 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I wished I could find her, 
Ooh oh oh, 
Cause I need to remind her, 
Ooh oh oh, 

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Skip skip through my head, 
Skip skip through my head, 
Skip skip skip through my head all day.
