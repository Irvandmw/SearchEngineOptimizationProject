Lyrics:


Hey, you give me bed head
You give me bed head, yeah

You put in work, yeah, you know what I like, like
Ooh, when you grab all my hair, pull it tight, tight
I told my girl only you do me right, right (do me right)
Do me right, only you do me right

As soon as I lay down
I just wanna turn around
Don't get me wrong, I love what you do
Don't let me be tight up
You make me feel light up
Got this messy hair because of you

So I say, you give me bed head
You give me bed head
I don't really mind cause you know I kinda like when ya
You give me bed head
You give me bed head
Baby, go on and mess my hair, won't you?
You give me bed head

You give me
You give me
You give me bed head
You give me
You give me

Yeah, you can tell by my hair I want more, more
I look like a lion, baby, come hear me roar, roar
I need a new 'do whenever you score
My look is wild even you can't ignore

As soon as I lay down
I just wanna turn around
Don't get me wrong, I love what you do
Don't let me be tight up
You make me feel light up
Got this messy hair because of you

So I say, you give me bed head
You give me bed head
I don't really mind cause you know I kinda like when you
You give me bed head
You give me bed head
Baby, go on and mess my hair, won't you?
You give me bed head

You give me (you)
