Lyrics:


Falling in love again, Never wanted to 
What am I to do, I can't help it 
Love always been my game, Play it how I may 
I was made that way, I can't help it 

Men, cluster to me like moths round a flame 
And if, their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame 

Falling in love again, Never wanted to 
What am I to do, I can't help it 

Men, cluster to me like moths round a flame 
And if, their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame 

Love always been my game, Play it how I may 
I was made that way, I can't help it 
Falling in love again, Never wanted to 
And what am I to do, I can't help it 

[Instrumental]

Falling in love again, Never wanted to 
What am I to do, I can't help it 
Love always been my game, Play it how I may 
I was made that way, I can't help it 

Men, cluster to me like moths round a flame 
And if, their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame 

Falling in love again, Never wanted to 
What am I to do, I can't help it 

Men, cluster to me like moths round a flame 
And if, their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame 

Love always been my game, Play it how I may 
I was made that way, I can't help it 

Can't help it, can't help it, can't help it 

(I'm falling in love again), can't help it 
(I'm falling in love again), can't help it 
Never wanted to 

Falling in love again - If you get burn 
Falling in love again - If you get burn 
I can't help it 

I'm not to blame, I'm not to blame 

Falling in love again - Never wanted to 
Falling in love again - Never wanted to 
(Can't help it), I can't help it 

Never wanted to, uh-uh 

I'm falling in love again, I'm falling in love again 
I'm falling in love again, I'm falling in love again 

I'm falling in love again, I never wanted to 
I'm not to blame, I was made that way 
(I'm not to blame)
