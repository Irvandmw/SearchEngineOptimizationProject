Lyrics:


I'll be home for the holidays
Thinking I'd stay away, oh no
I can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby I'm on the way, hold on

We been together for a while now
And there is nothing more important
Than being with you

I'll be home for the holidays
Thinking I'd stay away, oh no
I can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby I'm on my way, so hold on

We've made the most of not much at all
Survived on our faith and our love, oh oh
Look at our families, so beautiful
And I just can't wait to get home

I'll be home for the holidays
Thinking I'd stay away, oh no
I can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby I'm on my way, so hold on

I'll never leave you for long
You are the beat of my heart
Baby hold on, we have memories of our love, love

I'll be home for the holidays
Thinking I'd stay away, oh no
I can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby I'm on my way, so hold on

I'll be home for the holidays
Thinking I'd stay away, oh no
I can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby I'm on my way, so hold on
