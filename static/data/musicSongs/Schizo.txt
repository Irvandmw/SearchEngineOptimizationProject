Lyrics:


I don't know who you are
'Cause I don't know who I am
How can you know how to love
If you change your mind again?
I don't know who to be
Who do you want me to be?
Schizo, schizo, schizo

Tell me how you want me
I'll do anything you say
You like to play a lot of games
I'll be your favorite toy to play
You know I'm waiting for your call
I'm waiting for your call all day
I find you absolutely handsome
Whenever you walk away

And we got so many sides
I just can't seem to decide
You just can't make up your mind
La-da-da-la-da-da-da

I don't know who you are
'Cause I don't know who I am
How can you know how to love
If you change your mind again?
I don't know who to be
Who do you want me to be?
Schizo, schizo, schizo

I'll tell you how I want you
You'll do anything I say
I like to play a lot of games
You're just a little toy I play
I know you're waiting for my call so
I'll just make you wait all day
I like keeping you obsessed so
I'll just keep walking away

And we got so many sides
I just can't seem to decide
You just can't make up your mind
La-da-da-la-da-da-da

I don't know who you are
'Cause I don't know who I am
How can you know how to love
If you change your mind again?
I don't know who to be
Who do you want me to be?
Schizo, schizo, schizo

I know that you love me
Something we don't have to say
How we're always entertained
With all the little games we play
I'm never waiting for your call
'Cause we don't need to talk all day
We only love a little bit
'Cause baby that's the only way

I don't know who you are
'Cause I don't know who I am
How can you know how to love
If you change your mind again?
I don't know who to be
Who do you want me to be?
Schizo, schizo, schizo
