Lyrics:


I caught a wave, you fucked a wave
Now you act like you don't know nobody
Quick, calling your girls for advice
You don't deal with any guys you don't like
I look up, down, my roof gone, you gone
I woke up, I thought I had to leave my shoes on
All this time, was trying to get you back
But you never know

I been feenin' for your love
And maybe baby, you know
And maybe baby, you know
If you said you're really done
Maybe baby, you'd know (you)
You'd know

You just slow me down (don't you)
Don't you just slow me down (hey)
You won't be around (you won't be around)
Don't you slow me (don't you show me)
Don't you slow me
Baby, don't you slow me down

You got me in my feelings, I felt away
How she gon' act like she don't know nobody
She prolly got a new man in her life
Well fuck that nigga
I could care less what he do for you babe
'Cause everything that I do is amazing
Baby, we doin' our own thing
Yeah together, together

I been feenin' for your love
And maybe baby, you know
And maybe baby, you know
If you said you're really done
Maybe baby, you'd know (you)
You'd know

You just slow me down (don't you slow me down)
You just slow me down (hey)
You won't be around (yeah you won't be around)
Don't you slow me (don't you slow me)
Don't you slow me (don't you slow me)
Baby, don't you slow me down
