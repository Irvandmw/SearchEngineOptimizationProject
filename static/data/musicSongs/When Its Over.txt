Lyrics:


When it's over, it's really over
I'm afraid second times just can't be
When it's over, it's really over
And it's over between you and me

We've tried it again, oh, why do we pretend?
Let's give up and just throw that old towel in
Now we both know love's gone
So why do we hang on
Let's quit while we still can be friends

When it's over, it's really over
I'm afraid second times just cannot be
When it's over, it's really over
And it's over between you and me
