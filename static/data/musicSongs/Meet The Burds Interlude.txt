"Youâre back from Machu Pichu and youâre speaking Spanish?â
âItâs âbuenas tardesâ.â
âSo howâs Dave Burd doing?"
âAh, heâs alright, you know. Taking it one day at a time.â
âUmâ¦â
"Well, wait, can we hearâ¦ say a little bit more about what that means?"
"Uh, yeah, I mean, Iâm here in LA, I just moved here, obviously.â
"Wait, wait, wait, weâre still having trouble. Maybe you should try calling him back, Jean."
"Heâs got bad reception where he is is the problem."
"Can you hear me?"
"Is that it?"
"Can you hear me?"
"Yes, now I can. Yep."
"Alright."
"No, now we canât."
"Wait, Stewart, let him talk. Go ahead."
"What do you mean âYou canâtâ? Why canâtâ¦ You canât hear me?"
"Yes. We can, go ahead."
"Did you see that commercial for Anchorman 2?"
"Which one? Thereâs plenty of commercials."
'Ok, Stewart, let him talk about whatâs going on with him."
âAlright, go ahead."
