Lyrics:


I listen to the sound of the rain fallin' down my window
Prayin' for a gentle wind
To bring my baby back again
Tryna be strong but I'm not getting any stronger
Loneliness is tearing apart this heart of mine

I lie awake
'Cause I can't take
Another night lonely
It's been too long,
I can't hold on no more

Leavin' on the next plane out
'Cause I gotta see my baby
It's been too long
Since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
'Til he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again

Talking on the phone but that don't make it any better
Nothing's gonna ease this pain
Until I'm in his arms again
Runnin' down the stairs there's a taxi that's waiting for me
Loneliness, I'm gonna leave you far behind

I'd walk for days
Through pouring rain
Anything to be with him
It's been too long,
I can't be strong no more

Leavin' on the next plane out
'Cause I gotta see my baby
It's been too long
Since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
No, no, no, no
'Til he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again

I gotta be with my baby

Gotta be with him
Gotta be by his side
Gonna be with him
My heart's made up my mind

I'm leavin' on the next plane out
'Cause I gotta see my baby
It's been too long
Since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
No, no, no
'Til he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again

It's been too long
Since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
'Til he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me

I gotta be with my baby,
Gonna be with my baby
Gonna take the next plane
Or the next train
Gotta get there
Gotta see my baby

And nothing's gonna stop me
From leavin' this time
Leavin' on the next plane out
Leavin' on the next plane out

Next plane
Next train
