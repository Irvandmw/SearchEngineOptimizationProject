Lyrics:


[Rihanna:]
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile?
Can I not like you for awhile?
No

[Ne-Yo:]
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget
That I was upset
Can't remember what you did

[Rihanna:]
But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long
That's wrong

[Ne-Yo:]
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss
And fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Rihanna:]
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so

[Ne-Yo:]
And you completely know the power that you have
The only one that makes me laugh

[Rihanna:]
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right

[Ne-Yo:]
And I hate how much I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so

[Both:]
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So, you'll probably always have a spell on me

[Both:]
That's how much I love you
How much I need you
That's how much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
How I need you
That's how much I need you
I need you

[Rihanna:]
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
(can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just can't let you go
(but I just can't let you go, no)
And I hate that I love you so

And I hate that I love you so, so
