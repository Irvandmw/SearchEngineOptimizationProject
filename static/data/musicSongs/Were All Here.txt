Lyrics:


There's a driftwood sign at the end of the bar
With an "X" on a map that says, "Here's where you are"
With bright colored arrows with miles and degrees
That point to wherever home used to be

We come and we go like the tide
And we've all got our own reasons why

We're all here, 'cause where else would we go
When the world tips sideways, it's just where we roll
Where that crazy train ran out of track
Where we all jumped off and never looked back
On a buzz, on a binge, on a dare
On a whim, on a wing, on a prayer
Yeah, maybe we're all here, 'cause we ain't all there
Naw, we ain't all there

At the end of our ropes or the end of the line
Got a few loose screws, got a couple too tight
We're anchors and sails, we're tattoos and scars
We've all drifted out just a little too far

We were born bein' misunderstood
So we got here as fast as we could

We're all here, 'cause where else would we go
When the world tips sideways, it's just where we roll
Where that crazy train ran out of track
Where we all jumped off and never looked back
On a buzz, on a binge, on a dare
On a whim, on a wing, on a prayer
Yeah, maybe we're all here, 'cause we ain't all there

We ain't closin' down anytime soon
If you wanna come howl at the moon
We can always make a little more room

'Cause we're all here, where else would we go
When the world tips sideways, it's just where we roll
Where that crazy train ran out of track
Where we all jumped off and never looked back
On a buzz, on a binge, on a dare
On a whim, on a wing, on a prayer
Yeah, maybe we're all here, 'cause we ain't all there
Naw, we ain't all there
