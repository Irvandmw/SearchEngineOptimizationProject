Lyrics:


Got nothing to say anymore
There's nothing new
It's all been done before
Not looking to settle the score
So please let me be 

Thought I'd be the one you'd adore
I always thought
I would be so much more
Want something that I can't afford
So please let me be
Please let me be

This is the end of a really sad story
But don't feel bad for me
I started out alone
And in the end that's where I'll be 
Like the star of a really sad story
You don't live happily
I started out alone
And in the end that's where I'll be

Got nothing to say anymore
Originality went out that door
Not finding what I'm looking for
So please let me be
Please let me be

This is the end of a really sad story
But don't feel bad for me
I started out alone
And in the end that's where I'll be 
Like the star of a really sad story
You don't live happily
I started out alone
And in the end that's where I'll be 

I'll walk alone
I'll walk alone

Got nothing to say anymore 
There's nothing new 
It's all been done before
Not looking to settle the score 
So please let me be

Thought I'd be the one you'd adore
I always thought
I would be so much more
Now I'm all alone in this war
So please let me be
Please let me be

This is the end of a really sad story
But don't feel bad for me
I started out alone
And in the end that's where I'll be 
Like the star of a really sad story
You don't live happily
I started out alone
And in the end that's where I'll be 
That's where I'll be
