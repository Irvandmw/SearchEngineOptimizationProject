Lyrics:


(Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a mem'ry of you, oh yeah.)

I'm gonna start with the hall, take the pictures off the wall and burn 'em
Move the chairs around, take the window curtains down and burn 'em
Everything I see reminds me you were here
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you. (oh yeah.)

The candle of your set you gave me on the night of my birthday
The records that you bought, the hi-fi we loved to play
The decoratin' man will come and rearrange them
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you, oh yeah.

Everything I see reminds me you were here
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you. (oh yeah.)

Take the carpet off the floor, throw it out the door, it's filled with tears
Everything I find that brings you to my mind must disappear
Every night I dream I'll dream of someone new
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you.

Yeah, I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you. (oh yeah...)
