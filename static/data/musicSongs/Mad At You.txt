Lyrics:


Mad, mad at you
Mad, mad at you
Mad, mad at you
Mad, mad at you

We need to talk, you just say, "I don't want to start a fight"
But the minute it gets to my lips, I can feel my tongue is tied
And my eyes start to water but I can't stop you when you lie
Baby, we need to talk 'cause I think that it's time I walk away
Before you start calling my name
'Cause when you start begging me to stay

It's gonna be hard as hell
And baby, you know me well
No matter what you do
I can never be mad at you
And you only love yourself
For me there's no one else
No matter what you do
I can never be mad, mad, mad at you
Mad, mad at you

Baby, you were the one who convinced me to run into your arms
Oh, but now that you got me, it's easy to want another love
Thinking that you'll find a better one
And I'll sit here waiting until you're done

It's gonna be hard as hell
And baby, you know me well
No matter what you do
I can never be mad at you
And you only love yourself
For me there's no one else
No matter what you do
I can never be mad, mad, mad at you
Mad, mad at you

Mad, mad at you (yeah)
Mad, mad at you
Mad, mad at you
Mad, mad at you (oh-ah)

Oh, you love me (want me)
You need me (need me)
And they say it's so easy to leave me
You had me right under your skin
But I let you in

It's gonna be hard as hell
And baby, you know me well
No matter what you do (do, babe)
I just can't be mad, mad, mad at you
And you only love yourself
For me there's no one else
No matter what you do (no matter what you do)
I can never be mad, mad, mad at you (I can never be mad)
You
Mad, mad, mad at you
Mad, mad, mad at you (you)
