Lyrics:


I'm a wanderer on life's highway
I'm not one of that great legion with their traveling care
And though I haven't much religion
Here's my only prayer

Give me the road the wide winding highway
Just let me know the done beaten byways
And I'll travel along singing a vagabond song

Well give me the flowers the birds singing in the morning
Just let me see that sunrise and dawning
And I'll travel along singing a vagabond song

Happy you may be with your fashions, your passions, your smug little parts you play
You could never fool me with your fool me your jewelry all I can say
(Both) Give me the road the wide winding highway
[JL] ?
Traveling along singing a vagabond song
