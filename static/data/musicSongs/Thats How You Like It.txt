Lyrics:


Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How I Like It, baby

I need a thug thatâll have my back
Do-rag, Nike Airs to match
Ainât nothinâ wrong with that
Thatâs how I like it, baby
Where my thugs at?
White T-Shirt, I love that
Timberland boots, you does that, itâs a fact
Thatâs how I like it, baby

I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are
The way you ainât
I like your honesty, integrity,
It levels me, so please donât ever change

Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How I Like It, baby

I like the way you brush your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
Itâs just the real things you do
Thatâs why I wanna stick with you
Where my girls at?
Let them know we love that
Sexy way they does that (you did that)
Thatâs how I like it, baby

I hope you like my style
The way I dress
The way I flirt
Say yes
I hope you like my mind
The things I say
If Iâm with you, then Iâm with only you
My loyalty will never, ever change

Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How I Like It, baby

I know youâve heard Iâm a gangsta
They say âStay away from them gangstazâ
They never change up, or pull they pants up,
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Donât letâem push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt wrong before
This canât be what it feel like
And they donât really know whatcha feel like, for instance
They donât know the difference between real life
And the music videos & the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ainât mad at you, itâs just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
Thatâs why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hovah & the Letter B
How you like that, huh?

Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How You Like It, huh
Thatâs How I Like It, baby
