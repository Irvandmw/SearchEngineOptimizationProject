Lyrics:


People people everywhere
There's revolution in the air
Protest signs and people walking
Talking heads on TV talking
Pick a team, choose your side
Ain't no room for compromise
We're running out of better days
Brother all I'm trying to say

You see black and I see white...
No two hearts can beat the same
In a world of many colors
There's a little touch of grey
I say wrong when you say right
Different faces different names
Brother brother brother
It's ok to say: hey hey hey
I see things with a little touch of grey

If I whisper will you listen
Will I answer if you scream
Politics and bad religion
Took a hammer to the dream
Everybody loves their children
Forgiveness and a second chance
One more thing we got in common
Ain't love why we do this dance
Ain't love why we do this dance

You see black and I see white...
No two hearts can beat the same
In a world of many colors
There's a little touch of grey
I say wrong when you say right
Different faces different names
Brother brother brother
It's ok to say: hey hey hey
I see things with a little touch of grey

I believe there's train still coming
I believe there's room on board
Break the chains and raise your hands up
Be the change we're looking for
