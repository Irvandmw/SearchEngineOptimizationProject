Lyrics:


Wasting time, lost in love
We can go when no one will ever find us
So let's waste time
While we're young
We can drive til the morning sun comes up

We've got no place to go
But we can make it all on our own
We're drivin' slowly, down a country road
We can keep on through the night
If I got you by my side
I see the stars reflecting in your eyes

Think we got something special
Living life like we are rebels
You know we've got potential

Wasting time, lost in love
We can go when no one will ever find us
So let's waste time
While we're young
We can drive til the morning sun comes up

If the road gets tough
Being with you is enough
We're singing all the songs we used to love
We've got nothing to lose
And we're out with something new
But it all feels like home when I'm with you

Think we got something special
Living life like we are rebels
You know we've got potential

Wasting time, lost in love
We can go when no one will ever find us
So let's waste time
While we're young
We can drive til the morning sun comes up
