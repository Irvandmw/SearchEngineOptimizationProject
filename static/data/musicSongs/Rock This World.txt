Lyrics:


Everybody wants somethin
That seems to hard to get
So i sit here on a street in Venice
Waitin for the sun to set
Watching people live their lives
Wonderin what it means
Sometimes getting what you want
Is easier than it seems
I dont want to save the day
I just want to get my way

[Chorus]
And rock this world
Read my lips and watch 'em curl
Rock this world
It dont take much to please this girl
I don't need the glitter
Dont believe the hype
You might say im the simple type
Just like any other girl
Who wants to rock this world

Everybody's goin somewhere
So why not you and I?
We're all part of the same parade
Just people passin' by
And anything can happen
When the sun goes down like this
Maybe its just a miracle
When you find some happiness
I dont want to save the day
I just want to get my way

[Repeat Chorus]

People, can you hear me?
I want you to come near me
Can you feel the pull?
It can be so beautiful

[Repeat Chorus]
