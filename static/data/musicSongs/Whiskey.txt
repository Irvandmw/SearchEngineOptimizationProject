Lyrics:


Leaves are fallin'
It's September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young
'Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey

I never knew that love was blind
'Till I was hers
But she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn
I let it burn, yeah
The feeling, it was bittersweet
Realizing I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn
I had to learn, yeah

I used to try to forget her
But now I smile
When I remember

Leaves are fallin'
It's September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young
'Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey

Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin' I
Would've sold my soul
For a little more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time

I used to try to forget her
But now I smile
When I remember

Leaves are fallin'
It's September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young
'Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey

[A$AP Rocky:]
I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom PÃ©rignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off my heart

[Adam Levine (A$AP Rocky):]
Leaves are fallin'
It's September (Woah)
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young (So Young)
'Till she kissed me (Yeah)
Like a whiskey (Yeah)
And I was so young (So Young)
'Till she kissed me
Like a whiskey
Like a whiskey
