Lyrics:


Here I go now, I'm on my way
It's a brand new day
Brand new day
I'm two steps forward
Not looking back
See I'm done with that
So done with that

And it's so hard to leave you behind

And this is the last time that I hold ya
Yeah, I told ya, I'd be gone
And this is the moment to remember
So love me tender
Right or wrong, hold me till I'm gone

My bags are packed and I'm out the door
But I need one kiss, I just need one more
And my train is leaving at a quarter till 2
But all my memories are gonna stay with you

And it's so hard to leave you behind

And this is the last time that I hold ya
Yeah, I told ya, I'd be gone
And this is the moment to remember
So love me tender
Right or wrong, hold me till I'm gone
Mmm, hold me till I'm gone

Mmm, and my mind is gone
Got me feeling so wrong
I don't know that I'll be coming back
But when you say my name
My heart knows you're to blame, oh
And this is the last time that I hold ya
Yeah, I told ya, I'd be gone

This is the last time that I hold ya
Yeah, I told ya, I'd be gone
And this is the moment to remember
Love me tender
Right or wrong, hold me till I'm gone
This is the last time that I hold ya
Yeah, I told ya, I'd be gone
This is the moment to remember
Love me tender
Right or wrong, hold me till I'm gone
