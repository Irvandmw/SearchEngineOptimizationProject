Lyrics:


Which way did my heart go
The night that we met
I lost it so completely
I never will forget

Which way did my heart go
One look and I knew
That I was yours forever
My search for love was through

I laughed at other guys with stardust in their eyes
I never knew the thrill of ecstasy
But now I understand and realize how grand
Falling in love can be

Which way did my heart go
From me straight to you
But darling I don't mind I know that you'll be kind
To the heart I lost when I found you

I laughed at other guys with stardust in their eyes
I never knew the thrill of ecstasy
But now I understand and realize how grand
Falling in love can be

Which way did my heart go
From me straight to you
But darling I don't mind I know that you'll be kind
To the heart I lost when I found you
