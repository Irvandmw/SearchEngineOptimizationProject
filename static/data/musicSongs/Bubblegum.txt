Lyrics:


Licking the barrel of a gun
Chewing it like it's bubblegum
Wave it like a magic wand
Other few rounds out just for fun

Coming to get you on my own
Hoping that I could take you home
Picturing you with those other guys
Driving me crazy, I don't know

Well, I never wanted to be with you
But I think I am falling, so what can I do?
You'll just leave me until we drowning in tears

Oh, and you holding me...
As if I was the last man standing on earth...
