Song Name: The Waving Man
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I get in my car
And I drive away
There sits a man
Who waves all day
He sits right there
In his wheelchair
And his wave says hi
And it say goodbye

He's the waving man
He's the waving man
Waves 'em all the same
He's the waving man
He's the waving man
And he doesn't know
Anybody's name

Well I can tell by his cap
That he was in the war
But he don't get around
Like he did before
When he waved those troops
Onto a foreign shore
And he lost his friends
That he did adore

Well he's the waving man
He's the waving man
Waves 'em all the same
He's the waving man
He's the waving man
And he doesn't know
Anybody's name

Well he waved hello
When he came back home
And he told his girl
That he would never [?]
And he raised his kids
Until they waved goodbye
Then he waved good luck
Though he had to cry

He's the waving man
He's the waving man
Waves 'em all the same
He's the waving man
He's the waving man
And he doesn't know
Anybody's name

Well he waved goodbye
To his loving wife
The one true girl
He loved for life
But he never grieves
For his loving bride
'Cause he knows they'll meet
On the other side

He's the waving man
He's the waving man
Waves 'em all the same
He's the waving man
He's the waving man
And he doesn't know
Anybody's name

Well does he wave hello
Or does he wave goodbye
Only he can know
What he waves and why
Does he wave goodbye
To the life he led
Or does he wave hello
To the life ahead

He's the waving man
He's the waving man
Waves 'em all the same
He's the waving man
He's the waving man
And he doesn't know
Anybody's name
And no he doesn't know
Anybody's name
