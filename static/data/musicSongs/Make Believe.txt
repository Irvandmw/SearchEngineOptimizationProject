Lyrics:


Make believe, you're in my arms tonight
And there's a moon so bright
Oh, make believe

Make believe, there's no one else but me
To love you constantly
Oh, make believe

Please believe I love you, honestly I do
I wanna love you honey
In the mornin' and the nighttime too

Why don't you believe in everything I say
I'm sure I can find a way
To make you believe

Just believe, that you'll be mine someday
Then I won't have to say
Oh, make believe

Please believe I love you, honestly I do
I wanna love you honey
In the mornin' and the nighttime too

Why don't you believe in everything I say
I'm sure I can find a way
To make you believe

Just believe, that you'll be mine someday
Then I won't have to say
Oh, make believe
Yeah make believe
Oh baby make believe
Mmm make believe
