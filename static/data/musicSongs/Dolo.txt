I don't remember asking you a God damn thing
Hook me up, 4
Chapterzondabeat

I don't think these niggas heard about me (You ain't heard?)
Better go ask the word about me (Ask 'em)
Been getting money, don't want 'em 'round me (I don't want 'em)
Don't even worry 'bout me (Don't worry)
All of my clips is extended (They extended)
Most of the time I be solo (I be solo)
I don't need a hunnid niggas (Fuck 'em)
I'll pull up on you dolo (Skrrt!)
I don't need nobody, I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody with me (No sir)
I don't need nobody, I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody with me (No sir)
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't need nobody with me (Fu-Fu-Fuck them niggas)
I don't need nobody with me (Fu-Fu-Fuck them niggas)
I don't need nobody with me (Dolo, dolo)

I'm Baby Jesus, I pull up one-deep in that Beamer, like, "Who wanna see me?" (Who wanna see me?)
I find it funny, been rapping a month and niggas wanna be me (Woo!)
Boy, where they do that at? (Boy, where they do that at?)
Thought you niggas was leeches
Took my swag and I'm cool with that (That's cool)
Ain't tripping, you can keep it (Woo!)
Thank you, Baby Jesus
Thank you, shower me, I bless 'em, I always throw extra
One time for my bitches, they all treat me special
All of 'em love me, they down for whatever
They won't fuck with you 'cause you not on my level (On my level)
Lil' boy, don't play with me (Lil' boy, don't play with me)
Don't get me started, I might be retarded, I prolly got ADD (Add)
My burner stay with me (Fye)
And I'm 'bout whatever, that's all I'ma tell you
I'm great under pressure, the heart of a lion (Rrr)
That nigga can rap, but he probably lyin'
A lot of these niggas be lyin' and kickin' (Lyin' and kickin')
Talkin' 'bout shit that they not even livin' (Not even livin')
All of my music non-fiction
I speak, it's the truth, you should probably listen
You can learn something if you pay attention
Don't eat with that nigga, then fuck him
You'd be a fool if you slip up and trust him
That nigga don't fuck with you hard as you think he do
Best keep your eyes on the niggas you keep with you (Watch 'em)
Keep some iron and don't put it on safety
Hand me your gun, I'm prolly gon' take it
Front me some work, I'm not gon' pay it (Ah)

I don't think these niggas heard about me (You ain't heard?)
Better go ask the word about me (Ask 'em)
Been getting money, don't want 'em 'round me (I don't want 'em)
Don't even worry 'bout me (Don't worry)
All of my clips is extended (They extended)
Most of the time I be solo (I be solo)
I don't need a hunnid niggas (Fuck 'em)
I'll pull up on you dolo (Skrrt!)
I don't need nobody, I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody with me (No sir)
I don't need nobody, I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody with me (No sir)
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't need nobody with me (Fu-Fu-Fuck them niggas)
I don't need nobody with me (Fu-Fu-Fuck them niggas)
I don't need nobody with me
I don't think these niggas heard about me (You ain't heard?)
Better go ask the word about me (Ask 'em)
Been getting money, don't want 'em 'round me (I don't want 'em)
Don't even worry 'bout me (Don't worry)
All of my clips is extended (They extended)
Most of the time I be solo (I be solo)
I don't need a hunnid niggas (Fuck 'em)
I'll pull up on you dolo (Skrrt!)
I don't need nobody, I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody with me (No sir)
I don't need nobody, I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody with me (No sir)
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't need nobody with me (Fu-Fu-Fuck them niggas)
I don't need nobody with me (Fu-Fu-Fuck them niggas)
I don't need nobody with me
