Lyrics:


You said she was so pretty
And I died a little inside
But how would you know I was falling for you
For years being my best friend
and I said never again
to fall in love with someone like you

Finally
give me a chance
So pick me up, pick me up when I fall
Love me like you never did before
Give me all your love, all your love

Pick me up, pick me up once again
'Cause I was so much more than being your friend
Give me all your love, all your love
'Cause I can't get enough

Our first kiss finally happened, yeah
A bit weird but I'm happy that it happened
'Cause now I know you're feeling it too
And my life got a whole lot better now
that we are finally together
I'm so glad you're feeling it too

And thankfully
You gave me a chance

So will you pick me up, pick me up when I fall
Love me like you never did before
Give me all your love, all your love

Pick me up, pick me up once again
'Cause I was so much more than being your friend
Give me all your love, all your love
'Cause I can't get enough

And no, it's not hard
Not as hard as you think it would be to love me
Because I love you

So pick me up, pick me up when I fall
Love me like you never did before
Give me all your love, all your love
'Cause I can't get enough

Pick me up, pick me up when I fall
Love me like you never did before
Give me all your love, all your love

Pick me up, pick me up once again
'Cause I was so much more than being your friend
Give me all your love, all your love
'Cause I can't get enough

Pick me up, pick me up when I fall
Love me like you never did before
Give me all your love, all your love

Pick me up, pick me up once again
'Cause I was so much more than being your friend
Give me all your love, all your love
'Cause I can't get enough
