Lyrics:


Tulip is a girl from the bottom of the earth
She can make her mind up
Tulip is the one
Who takes pride in all she's done
She will show it all off
Tulip sets the pain
With a smile up on your face
She loves

Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun

Tulip loves the breeze
She will tickle, she will tease
She sways in her glory
Tulip takes a stand
She is tall and she is grand
She will lift your spirits
Tulip is your friend
And when spring is end
Don't cry, she'll return again

Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun
Tulip loves the sun

Don't cry, she'll return again
Tulip loves the sun
