Lyrics:


Caring is a word I use for heartache
And sharing is a word I use for heartbreak
Oh can't you see what you've done
You've left the only one - that's me
I'm called lonely
Love is a a word I use for games now
Living is a word I just can't say somehow
Cuz when you said goodbye
All I did was sit and cry for me
I'm called lonely
Lonely is a word I know so well
I'm not an man anymore
I'm just a shell
Happy is a word that means yesterday
Sadness is a word that's here to stay
Oh, can't you see what you've done
You've left the only one - that's me
I'm called lonely
