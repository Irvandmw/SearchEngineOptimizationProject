Lyrics:


Hey, baby, don't you do me wrong
Come and love your mama all night long
All right, hey, hey, all right

See the boy with the diamond ring
He knows how to shake that thing
All right now, hey, hey, hey, hey

Tell your mama, tell your pa
I'm gonna send you back
To Arkansas, oh, yes
You don't do right
You don't do right now

When you see me in misery
Come on, baby, see about me
All right, all right, all right

He's a boy and really turns me on
He can boogie all night long
Yeah, yeah, what'd I say, all right

Well, tell me what'd I say (Tell me what'd I say)
Tell me what'd I say (Tell me what'd I say)
Tell me what'd I say now (Tell me what'd I say)
Tell me what'd I say (Tell me what'd I say)
Tell me what'd I say (Tell me what'd I say)
Tell me what'd I say (Tell me what'd I say)

Well, I wanna know (Yes, I wanna know)
Baby, I wanna know now (Yes, I wanna know)
Baby, I wanna know now (Yes, I wanna know)
I wanna know now (Yes, I wanna know)
Yeah, I wanna know (Yes, I wanna know)
Well, I wanna know (Yes, I wanna know)

One more time!

Huh (Huh) Ho (Ho) Huh (Huh)
Ho (Ho) Huh (Huh) Ho (Ho)

Well, one more time (Just one more time)
I say one more time right now (Just one more time)
Yeah, one more time now (Just one more time)
I say it one more time, yeah (Just one more time)
Just one more time (Just one more time)

Huh (Huh) Ho (Ho) Huh (Huh)
Ho (Ho) Huh (Huh) Ho (Ho)

Make me feel so good (Make me feel so good)
Yeah, you make me good (Make me feel so good)
Make me feel so good now (Make me feel so good)
Make me feel so good right now (Make me feel so good)
Make me feel so good now (Make me feel so good)
Just like I should now (Make me feel so good)

Well, shake that thing (Baby, shake that thing)
Baby, shake that thing (Baby, shake that thing)
Baby, shake that thing now (Baby, shake that thing)
Yeah, shake that thing (Baby, shake that thing)
Baby, shake that thing now (Baby, shake that thing)
Baby, shake that thing (Baby, shake that thing)

Woah! I feel all right (Make me feel all right)
You make me I feel all right (Make me feel all right)
You make me I feel all right now (Make me feel all right)
Yeah, all right (make me feel all right)
I'm all right now (Make me feel all right)
Make me I feel all right (Make me feel all right)

I need to tell you everything is Groovie!
