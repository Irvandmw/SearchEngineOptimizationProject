Lyrics:


[instrumental & choral opening]

When hearts are young, 
When love's a star, 
A song unsung, 
A magic land that gleams afar! 
We feel, it's truth, 
It's voice allures, 
And youth calls youth, 
Sayin' take me I am yours! 

[instrumental verse]

(When hearts are young, 
When love's a star, 

A song unsung, 
A magic land that gleams afar!) 
We feel, it's truth, 
It's voice allures, 
And youth calls youth, 
Sayin' take me I am yours! 

(Sayin' take me I am yours!) 
When hearts are young!
