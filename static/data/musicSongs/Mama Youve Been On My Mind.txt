Lyrics:


Perhaps it's the colour of the sun cut fly
Uncovering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama you've been on my mind

I don't mean no trouble, please don't put me down or get upset
I'm not pleading insane, I can't forget
I do not walk the floor, bow down and pampered yet
But mama you've been on my mind

Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow
Where you've been don't bother me, or bring me down in sorrow
Don't even matter to me where you're wakin' up tomorrow
But mama you're just on my mind

I am not askin' you to say the words like yes or no
Please understand that I've got no place for you to go
I'm just breathin' to myself pretendin' not that I don't know
Mama you've been on my mind

When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
I know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd just like to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind
