Lyrics:


God bless the coffin they carry me off in
God bless the coffin they carry me off in
They carry me off in

Iâve walked amongst the living dead
And Iâm sick of the voices that are in my head
Iâve taken the ride and Iâve danced with death
I had nine lives and Iâve got one left

Cause Iâve got what you want
You've got what I need
Letâs get together and keep me forever
Yeah waaaaaaahh!

Iâm harder than a coffin nail
Iâve been to heaven; Iâve been to hell
Iâm harder than a coffin nail
Iâve been to heaven; Iâve been to hell

I never thought Iâd need someoneâs help
(I donât need your help)

âCause Iâll handle it all and do it by myself
(Iâll do this by myself)

I'm never alone âtill I hit rock bottom
(Iâm not afraid to fall)

Iâm so fucking stubborn and so fucking rotten
(Hit the bottom)

Cause Iâve got what you want
You've got what I need
Letâs get together and keep me forever
Yeah waaaaaaahh!

Iâm harder than a coffin nail
Iâve been to heaven; Iâve been to hell
Iâm harder than a coffin nail
Iâve been to heaven; Iâve been to hell

God bless the coffin they carry me off in...
God bless the coffin they carry me off in...

Cause Iâve got what you want
You've got what I need
Letâs get together and keep me forever
Yeah waaaaaaahh!

Iâm harder than a coffin nail
Iâve been to heaven; Iâve been to hell
Iâm harder than a coffin nail
Iâve been to heaven; Iâve been to hell

God bless the coffin they carry me off in!
God bless the coffin they carry me off in!
