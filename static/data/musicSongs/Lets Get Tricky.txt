Lyrics:


Come on,
Let's get tricky.
Let's go creepy,
Get it started.

do it
Kick it
Start it.

Kick it (kick it), kick it.

Let's get tricky.

Come on,
Let's get tricky.
Let's go creepy,
Get it started.
Do it.

Kick it
Start it.
Kick it (kick it), kick it.

Let's get tricky.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrgh!!

I love a little bit of darkness,
Kept in the shadow.
Slithering around.

What's that in the corner?
Everybody gonna
Screaming, lights go out.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrgh!

Got so creepy, creepy
So freaky, freaky.
Do you wanna trick-or-treat me?

With the late night wolf's howling in the silence. Please believe ...

Come on ghouls, and goblins, yeah.

We no wan't no zombies here.

Give me all of that candy now!

Halloween is going down.

Come on and move your feet.
As we rock into the beat.

It's your trick, it's your treat.
It's the party in the street.

Let's go freaky creepy in all,
Work out.
Prepare to scare,
We all about.
Monster party, we roll around.
Terrified, you scream and shout!

Aaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrgh!

Come on,
Let's get tricky.
Let's go creepy,
Get it started.
Do it.

Kick it
Start it.
Kick it (kick it), kick it.

Let's get tricky.

Come on,
Let's get tricky.
Let's go creepy,
Get it started.
Do it.

Kick it
Start it.
Kick it (kick it), kick it.

Let's get tricky.

Let's get tricky.

Let's get tricky.
