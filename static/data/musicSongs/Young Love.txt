Lyrics:


(Young love!... Young love!... 
Young love!... Young love!...) 

They say for every boy an' girl, 
There's just one love in this whole world, 
And I know I found mine, 
The heavenly touch of your embrace, 
Tells me no one can take your place, 
Ever in my heart! 

Young love, first love! 
Filled with true devotion... 
Young love, our love! 
We share, with deep, emotion... 

(Emotion!... Emotion!) 

Oh, just one kiss from your sweet lips 

Will tell me that your love is real 
And I can feel, that it's true! 
We will vow to one another, 
There will never be another 
Love... 
For you, or for me! 

Young love, first love! 
Filled with true devotion... 
Young love, our love! 
We share, with deep, emotion... (Emotion!) 

(Young love!... 
Young love!... Young love!...)
