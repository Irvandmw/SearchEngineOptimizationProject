Lyrics:


I ain't lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone
More than I'd like to, but I'm okay with staying home
My how the last few months have changed
I'm smilin' more despite the pain 

I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't working, what's still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussing out
Now and then I let it go
I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learning how to build a better boat

I hate waiting, ain't no patience in these hands
I'm not complaining, sometimes it's hard to change a man
I think I'm stronger than I was
I'll let God do what He does

I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't working, what's still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussing out
Now and then I let it go
I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learning how to build a better boat

I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't working, what's still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussing out
Now and then I let it go
I ride the waves I can't control
If it's working I don't know
When I get done, the thing may not float
But I'm learning how to build a better boat
