Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Oh there is life after death
The death of all those parts of you
You thought you needed
And there is sweetness left
You thought that none would survive

You were so bitter
But you will taste again
No you will not stay numb for long
I'll pinch you
And after all the tears
There will be laughter too
I promise

[Chorus:]
You're stronger than it
You're stronger than this shit
You're stronger than it
You're stronger than this shit

And you are coping now
Although it may not feel like it
You are okay
And you will love again
And you are loved right now

Forgive yourself
And you'll help you
You'll do enough
You'll help enough
You are enough
And you will lose again
But now you realize
You didn't need it

[Chorus x6]
