Lyrics:


I never thought you were a fairweather friend
You never let me down, you're true to the end
Youâre in the darkest hour, when all was lost
Somehow you left the light on
You faced the wrong and showed the world a thing or two
Stood up for me, for you
And you should know

Some say it wasnât worth the things we went through
I say it ainât worth losing you
I hope you know how much youâve changed all our lives
Someday youâll see if only through heavenâs eyes

I still remember the things that you said
I keep your words alive I could never forget
Cause in the final hour you made me proud
So proud that I could know you
You told the world its time that they believed in you
You stood for right and truth 
And you should know

Some say it wasnât worth the things we went through
I say it ainât worth losing you
I hope you know how much youâve changed all our lives
Someday youâll see if only through heavenâs eyes

Only through heavenâs eyes ...

And so we canât forget
Weâve got to keep remembering them all
The ones who took the fall
They did it for us all
And we should learn from it
Stand up if you believe in it
Youâve got to face the world ... be strong

Some say it wasnât worth the things we went through
I say it ainât worth losing you
I hope you know how much youâve changed all our lives
Someday youâll see if only through heavenâs eyes
[repeat]
