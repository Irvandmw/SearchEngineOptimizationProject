Lyrics:


(Lala lalalala, lala lalalala, lala lalalala, lalala.)
Said the older to the younger giraffe, do you need someone to care for?
Said the older to the younger giraffe, I'm available and therefore
Hand and hand they both went down to spend the day in jungle town.
Anything that they can do, humans can do too.
As one human to another, I'd like to question you (what's the question?)
If it takes the sun and the rain to make a tree grow, (that's a hard one)
If it takes the moon and the tide to make the sea flow,
What does it take to love a child? (to love a child)
To love a child (to love a child)
You can start with a smile and after a while,
A hug and a kiss, it takes no more than this
To love a child (to love a child), hmm, hmm, hmm (hmm, hmm, hmm)
Said the bigger to the smaller raccoon, do you need someone to move you,
Said the smaller to the bigger raccoon, if you move I will follow.
(Up they went to climb a tree, they end the day most happily.)
(Anything that they can do, humans can do too.)
As one human to another, I'd like to question you.
If it takes the sun and the rain to make the tree grow, (to make the tree grow)
If it takes the moon and the tide to make the sea flow, (to make the sea flow)
What does it take to love a child? (to love a child)
To love a child (to love a child)
You can start with a smile and after a while,
A hug and a kiss, it takes no more than this
To love a child (to love a child), to love a child (hmm, hmm, hmm)
To love a child (lala, lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala)
(lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala,)
(lala lalala..)
