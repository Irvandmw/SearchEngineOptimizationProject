Lyrics:


I, I must confess
How hard I tried to breathe
Through the trees of loneliness.
And you, you must confess
How hard you need to see
Through the heart beating out my chest.

Feel like we've been falling down 
Like these autumn leaves.
But baby don't let winter come, 
Don't let our hearts freeze.

If the morning light don't steal our soul,
We will walk away from empty gold.

Dark as midnight sun,
Smoke as black as charcoal
Fills into our fragile lungs.
Cause when our demons come,
Dancing in the shadows, 
To a game that can't be won.

Feel like we've been falling down 
Like these autumn leaves.
But baby don't let Winter come, 
Don't let our hearts freeze.

If the morning light don't steal our soul,
We will walk away from empty gold.
If the morning light don't steal our soul,
We will walk away from empty gold.

We're the underdogs in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones.
We're the alley cats and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our souls.

We're the underdogs in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones.
We're the alley cats and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our souls.

If the morning light don't steal our soul,
We will walk away from empty gold.
If the morning light don't steal our soul,
We will walk away from empty gold.
We will walk away from empty gold.
