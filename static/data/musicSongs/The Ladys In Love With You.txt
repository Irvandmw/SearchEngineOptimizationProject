Song Name: The Lady's In Love With You
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


If thereâs a gleam in her eye
Each time she straightens your tie
That means the ladyâs in love with you
And if she canât dress for a date
Without that waiting you hate
That means the ladyâs in love with you
And when your friends ask you over to join the table
But she will find that far away booth for two
Well Jack, hereâs just how it stands
Youâve got romance on your hands
Because the ladyâs in love with you
