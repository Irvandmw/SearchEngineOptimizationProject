Lyrics:


[Miley:]
I know this isn't what I wanted,
I never thought it'd come this far,
Just thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are

[Nick:]
We were young and times were easy,
But I could see it's not the same.
I'm standing here but you don't see me,
I'd give it all for that to change.
And I don't want to lose her,
I don't want to let her go.

[Miley:]
I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if it's over,
Cause I would leave you alone.
[Nick:]
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold her,
[Miley and Nick:]
Like I did before the storm
[Miley:]
Before the storm

[Nick:]
With every strike of lightning
[Miley:]
Comes a memory that lasts
[Miley and Nick:]
Not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash
[Miley:]
Maybe I should give up

[Miley:]
I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if it's over,
Cause I will leave you alone.
[Nick:]
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold her,
Like I did before the storm

[Miley:]
Trying to keep the lights from going out
[Miley and Nick:]
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm.

[Miley and Nick:]
Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm

Yeah

[Miley and Nick:]
Like I did before the storm
