Lyrics:


I canât seem to shake this feeling
That we both could break through that ceiling
And thereâs a look in your eyes and Iâm not surprised
And Iâm wishing that we could start all over again

I get the feeling that weâre losing heart
Heart, heart
Harder to keep it than it was to start
Start, start
I keep feeling like we fall apart
Better than we fall in love
I canât seem to shake this feeling

The words came out like a landslide
What you canât take back keeps you up at night
And itâs hard to fly when your wings are tied
And Iâm wishing that we could start all over again
Yeah, start it over again

I get the feeling that weâre losing heart
Heart, heart
Harder to keep it than it was to start
Start, start
I keep feeling like we fall apart
Better than we fall in love
I keep feeling like we fall apart
And then we got to fight to fall back in love again

And I canât seem to shake this feeling
No, I canât seem to shake this feeling
Well, maybe itâs time to start healing?

I wonder when did I lose your heart
Your heart, your heart?
And whether we can go back to the start
The start, the start?
I keep feeling like we fall apart
Better than we fall in love
I keep feeling like we fall apart
And then we got to fight to fall back in love again

And I canât seem to shake this feeling

We both started with a broken heart
Admit thereâs a problem thatâs a start
And I want to start healing, healing

âCause everybody wants to rock and roll
But a couple of years and it takes a toll
And I wanna start healing, healing

And I canât seem to shake this feeling
Oh I canât seem to shake this feeling
