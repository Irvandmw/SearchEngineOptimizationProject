Lyrics:


She's changed her mind on everything
She's changed her mind on everything
She's changed her mind on everything
She's changed her mind on everything

Dear Deidre can you tell me
Where I'm going wrong
I'm following your advice
But my wife's still gone
She left me for my girlfriend
The four faced cows
We had three in a bed
But there's only two now

I wrote to you about it last July
You printed it and millions read Deidre's reply
Dear Deidre can you tell me
Where I'm going wrong
Cause I'm following your advice but my wife's still gone

She's changed her mind on everything and how
She was a mother to our Son
She's a Guardian now

Dear Deidre can you tell me
Where I'm going wrong
Cause I'm following your advice
But my wife's still gone

She's changed her mind on everything
She's changed her mind on everything
She's changed her mind on everything
She's changed her mind on everything
