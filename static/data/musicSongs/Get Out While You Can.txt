Lyrics:


I've been looking all night, watching them empty hours
Invisible to this crowd, always double vision
I've been losing my mind, listening to broken speech
Stacking up broken seats, it's a lonely picture
And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said

Get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the night slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can ooh ooh

As I'm sweeping up glass, I see the exit lights so green
These people falling into the streets
Something comes together
I've been here too long and if I stay, they'll tie me down
I know this chance won't hang around, so I'm gone forever
And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said

So get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the night slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can ooh ooh

Packing up my suitcase, racing down forgotten streets
Making my tracks along the cracks in the concrete
Seeing those headlights shining down upon my feet
You'll find me, you'll find me on the run
For all the bleeding hearts pushing 'round the stubborn carts
I've seen the greener grass, I've seen the faster cars
And I don't need your happy hours
I don't need your lonely bars
I'm projected like a bullet from a gun
So take your final look at me, maybe even take my hand
Steady on the staircase, come and chase the master plan
Long way to get away, play it like a grand slam
This is no encore, we have only just begun

So get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the night slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh...
