Lyrics:


Have I told you how good
It feels to be me
When I'm in you?

I can only stay clean
When you are around.
Don't let me fall.
Oh, no.

If I close my eyes forever would it ease the pain?
Could I breathe again?

Baby, I'm addicted.
I'm out of control,
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying.
Baby, I'm a liar,
But all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm trying.

I'm wasted away.
I made a million mistakes.
Am I too late?

There's a storm in my head.
It rains on my bed
When you're not here.

I'm not afraid of dying,
But I am afraid of losing you.

Maybe I'm addicted.
I'm out of control,
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying.
Maybe I'm a liar,
But all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm trying.

When you're lying next to me
Love is flowing through to me.
Oh, it's beautiful.

Everything is clear to me
'Til I hit reality
And I lose it all.

I lose it all.
I lose it all.
I lose it all.

You're the only reason,
Yeah, you're the only reason I'm trying.

Maybe I'm addicted.
Oh, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying,
Maybe I'm addicted.
Don't want to lose it all,

Maybe I'm a liar,
But all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm trying.

I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.

Yeah, you know I'm addicted.
You know I'm addicted.
Yeah, you know I'm addicted.
