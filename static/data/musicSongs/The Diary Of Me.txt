Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Iâm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah whatâs the word on you
Lay low Iâm a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am an open book
Turn the page itâs all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Iâm poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
Iâm a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I donât get up
I just get down yeah

But here I am an open book
Turn the page itâs all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Itâs raining on Sunday
Thereâs nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
Youâre the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I canât stop thinking about you
I bet youâre thinking of me too

Well here I am an open book
Turn the page itâs all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page itâs all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
