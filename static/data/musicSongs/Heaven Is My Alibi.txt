Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Listen now the autumn blows
as I try to warm your toes
The radiator
is covered with all your clothes

The fire burning in your eyes
in colours that I canât describe
Makes it easy
Clarifies what you imply

[Chorus:]
Turn off the TV
Bring down the lights
Play me the sound of silence tonight
My love for you is larger than life
And heaven is my alibi

When sometime in a billion years
a thousand worlds have disappeared
The new born stars will
remember how you made me feel

[Chorus:]
Turn off the TV
Bring down the lights
Play me the sound of silence tonight
My love for you is larger than life
And heaven is my alibi

[Release:]
Turn us to dust between the stars
Weâll never be apart
