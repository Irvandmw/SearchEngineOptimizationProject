Lyrics:


Coo coo roo coo coo, paloma 
tell her that I'm oh so lonely...  
Coo coo roo coo coo, paloma 
tell her that I love her only...  

Please, pretty little dove,  
hurry to my love, tell her this for me...  
Since she is far away,  
every day is sad, blue as it can be...  
I couldn't even start,  
pouring out my heart, to her in a letter...  
You, pretty little bird,  

you can sing the words, you can tell her better... 

Coo coo roo coo coo, paloma 
coo coo roo coo coo [Spanish]

Coo coo roo coo coo... 
coo coo roo coo coo...  
coo coo roo coo coo... paloma...
