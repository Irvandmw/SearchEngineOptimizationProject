Lyrics:


I go all in, in love and life
But I can't take another sudden goodbye

Deep, deep down inside
Tell me...

Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?

I have to ask 'cause I need something to last
Too many times I've been left behind

Deep down inside
Tell me...

Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?

Deep, deep down inside
Deep, deep down inside
Tell me...

Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
