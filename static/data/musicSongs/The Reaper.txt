Lyrics:


Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?
Dark days, I'm terrified
I know that something isn't right
You take what you want
Then you leave when you're done
Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?

I'm in my house in the hills with the reaper
And I wonder if he knows what I've done
I've got the keys and I'm going off the deep end
Doesn't hurt when you're doing it for fun
Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(Am I in your?)

I pull the trigger just to show her that I need her
But she don't really trust anyone
Yeah, everybody's always looking for a feature
And no one's stepping up to be the one

Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

(Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?
Dark days, I'm terrified
I know that something isn't right
You take what you want
Then you leave when you're done
Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?

I'm in my house in the hills with the reaper
And I wonder if he knows what I've done
I've got the keys and I'm going off the deep end
Doesn't hurt when you're doing it for fun
Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

(Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Am I in your way? Ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
