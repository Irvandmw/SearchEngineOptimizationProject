Lyrics:


There were no black cats in our path
I've been side stepping cracks in the pavement

Everybody thought we would be the ones to have it all
I could be the one, we could be the ones that have it

First envy, then comes shame,
Then secrets and the blame
Their quiet resignation on your face
You're spoken on your truce
You're shaken and you're bruised
There's nothing left to prove

Always, always we could be
What you promised me
So close, so close weren't we?
We almost had it
Always, always you can get what you want
But not what you need
Someday, someday you and me

We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)

There were no second thoughts in my head
There were no monsters underneath our bed

Everybody thought we would be the ones to have it all
We could've been the ones, I should've been the one that have it

First envy, then comes shame,
Then secrets and the blame
Their quiet resignation on your face
You're spoken on your truce
You're shaken and you're bruised
There's nothing left to prove

Always, always we could be
What you promised me
So close, so close weren't we?
We almost had it
Always, always you can get what you want
But not what you need
Someday, someday you and me

We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)

We got nothing left to lose
We got nothing left to prove
You and I know the truth
There was nothing else that we could do

Always, always we could be
What you promised me
We're so close, so close weren't we?
We almost had it
Always, always you can get what you want
But not what you need
Someday, someday you and me

We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
We could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
