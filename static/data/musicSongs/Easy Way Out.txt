Lyrics:


Some people look at themselves,
With such doubt, Some people 
Just take the easy way out..
But I don't want to..

Some people don't care,
Whats wrong or right,
Some people just wanna
Walk through life,
Some people just try to follow the crowd..
But I don't want too..

They'll never know what life is about..
So don't be like them,
Don't take the easy way out,
Don't take the easy way out,
Oh No,
Don't take the easy way..

Some people look at the
World with such doubt
(Don't take the easy way..)
Some people just
Take the easy way out,
But I don't want too..

Some people don't try
To be themselves,
Some people wanna be,
Somebody else,
Some people don't mind keepin'
Their voice down,
But I don't want too..

They'll never know what life is about..
So don't be like them,
Don't take the easy way out,
Don't take the easy way out,
Oh No,
Don't take the easy way..

If you've got a point to make,
Make it,
If you've got something to say,
Say it,
Its your life so whatever you do,
Don't fake it,
Don't fake it.

They'll never know what life is about..
So don't be like them,
Don't be like them..
Don't be like them..
Don't take the easy way out,
Don't take the easy way out,
Oh No,
Don't take the easy way..
