Lyrics:


If you wanna put this on me, thatâs fine
I never blamed you for anything at all, in my life
Things we try to do wonât work
So can you help me out?
Things we try to do wonât work
So can you help me out?

And say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind itâs true
Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new

See and I donât wanna take it to the get gate
Where I came fly show
I could have taken anyone there
But I like the way she brushed her hair back

I never trust, begin to realize
How fast I would turn and I
I was blind to all
Yeah I saw all

Say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind itâs true
Cause I have fallen for you

Say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind itâs true
Cause I have fallen for you

Say if you love somebody new

Seeing this fake heart break
And stomach ache has got me
Acting like a pregnancy

I never fell for you, you tripped me
Cause even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind itâs true, in my mind now

I never fell for you, you tripped me
Even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind now, in my mind

I never fell for you, you tripped me
