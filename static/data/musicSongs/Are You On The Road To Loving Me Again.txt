Lyrics:


Are you here just to pass the time of day
Or is it love that brings you back my way
Did you miss me in the time we've been apart
Are you looking for the way back to my heart

Are you on the road to loving me again
Did the trail of yellow brick come to an end
Did you realize the future lies right here where it began
Are you on the road to loving me again

I don't need any promises and such
Only you and the way we used to touch
Do I really see or could my heart be blind
Is it really me you're coming back to find

Are you on the road to loving me again
Did the trail of yellow brick come to an end
Did you realize the future lies right here where it began
Are you on the road to loving me again

Are you on the road to loving me again
Did the trail of yellow brick come to an end
Did you realize the future lies right here where it began...
