Lyrics:


She called the cops to catch the king
And now it's gone, the words to say
And it goes on...
He ran away from the path
Before he called on the phone before he crashed
And it goes on...
Oh, oh, oh...

And you feel the storm arise
See the rising of the tide
As it crawls upon the shore
And breaks your heart
And the waves come crashing in
Like a war you cannot win
And the end is when you watch it fall apart
Just like sand castles
Just like sand castles

The yore [?] inside is home
Has alleged that she's been gone
And it go...
It's hard enough to heal the pain
And build [?] what the world to go away
And it go...
Oh, oh, oh

And you feel the storm arise
See the rising of the tide
As it crawls upon the shore
And breaks your heart
And the waves come crashing in
Like a war you cannot win
And the end is when you watch it fall apart
Just like sand castles
Just like sand castles
Just like sand castles
Just like sand castles

And I see no, now I see alone
It's hard to see it all, yeah...
See it all
Just like sand castles
Just like sand castles

It's alright
