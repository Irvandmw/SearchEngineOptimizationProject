Lyrics:


One, two, three, four
Yeah
Uh
Come on, baby, hurt me
Uh

When we both die
And go to heaven
Will you still desire me
Or will He make you fire me
Will He let you hurt me in the upper room

Let me say now
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Come on, baby, hurt me in the upper room
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Love and sex in the upper room

Alright
Hit me
Ow
Huh
Two

When we both cry
And want each other
Will you still resist me
Or will you come and kiss me
How am I supposed to sleep
Without you in my arms

Keep singin'
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Come on, baby, hurt me in the upper room
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Love and sex in the upper room
Photos

Get low
Boom boom sha la boom
Not too sad, too sad, happy too happy
Just one single sexy glance or two
That's what kind of party is the cool
Sha la la boom
I put on my Sunday best
(His clothes is so sharp)
Sha boom

When we all die
And go to heaven
Will He let us fantasize
Is there some new cool surprise?
Let's all try to come together before we go

Keep singin'
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Come on, baby, hurt me in the upper room
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Love and sex in the upper room
Yeah, the upper room

Keep on singin'
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Come on, baby, hurt me in the upper room
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Love and sex in the upper room
In the upper room

Do you feel alright?
(Yeah!)
Do you feel alright?
(Yeah!)
Do you feel alright?
Let me hear you say, let me
L
Let me hear you say "Yeah!"
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)
Let me hear you say "Yeah!"
(Yeah!)
Whoo
(Yeah!)
Alright
(Yeah!)
Let me hear you say "Yeah!"
Ooh, oh Lord
Oh, huh
(Sha la la la, sha la la boom)
Whoo
(Come on, baby, hurt me in the upper room)
Sha la la la
(Sha la la la, sha la la boom)
Yeah
(Love and sex in the upper room)
Yeah
Keep singin'
(Sha la la la, sha la la boom)
Come on, baby
(Come on, baby, hurt me in the upper room)
Hurt me, baby, yeah
(Sha la la la, sha la la boom)
Alright, oh
(Love and sex in the upper room)
Ah yeah
That's right
