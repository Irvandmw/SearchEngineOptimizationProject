Lyrics:


Throw up your rockfist if you're feelin it when I drop this. Show 'em how we blow the spot,
Let's make it hot, Let's shock 'em with the bodyrock 'til the party stops. It's time to take
it up a notch, and keep it locked, for all the headbangers in the parking lot. Here we come, if
you're ready or not. No time to talk. Cause we on the clock bringin that Uhh, Uhh, to your
block. Let me show ya where we're comin from, it don't stop, from L.A. to New York. Show me
what you got now!

All I know, is what it did take to make this, All I am, is what it will take to break this.
All I know, is what it did take to make this. All I am is what it will take to break this.
Light it up now, Light it up now.

Throw up your rawkfist if you're feelin it when I drop this. Uhh, Uhh, That's the sound when
the rock hits. Oh, you never know, I might let go. Just roll, roll. Get ready, Get set. Throw
up your rawkfist if you're feelin it when I drop this. Uhh, Uhh, That's the sound when the rock
hits. Oh, you never know, I might let go.

Try runnin me down, keep runnin around, I'm fakin you out, would you just, make it what you
want it to be, about to find out, what you're all about, I'm callin you out, won't ya just set
me free.

Try runnin me down, keep runnin around, I'm fakin you out, would you just, make it what you
want it to be, about to find out, what you're all about, I'm callin you out, won't ya just set
me free.

All I know, is what it did take to make this, All I am, is what it will take to break this.
All I know, is what it did take to make this. All I am is what it will take to break this.
Light it up now, light it up now.

Throw up your rawkfist if you're feelin it when I drop this. Uhh, Uhh, That's the sound when
the rock hits. Oh, you never know, I might let go. Just roll, roll. Get ready, Get set. Throw
up your rawkfist if you're feelin it when I drop this. Uhh, Uhh, That's the sound when the rock
hits. Oh, you never know, I might let go. Just roll, roll. Get ready, Get set.

That's the sound when the rock hits, that's the sound when the rock hits, that's the sound
when the rock hits. Jump, jump! Make the sound when the rock hits,

Throw up you rockfist if you're feelin it when I drop this.
