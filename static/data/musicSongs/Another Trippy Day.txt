Lyrics:


The city wakes
A slow crescendo
And the floor beneath me shakes
A downtown 'A' train passing
So in my dream
The subway rumble
Drives a cinematic scene
Open my eyes
The silent thunder
Of a room I recognize
A hint of distant jazzing
Lovers embrace
Just barely morning
I turn and see her face

Think I'm headed for a trippy day
Got a groove on' and I want to say:
"come on, come on
I want to dance tonight"

Think I'm headed for a trippy day
Everybody gonna find a way
Come on, come on
I want to play tonight
It's on the street
The tunes are right there
You can't deny the beat
The drum loop got me jumpin'
Like neon glow
The urban buzzing
Still, you are all I know

Life is feeling like some dreamy fantasy
Ambient and intimate, a prophesy
I never knew such sweet times
I may be just lucky fool
