Lyrics:


You keep me dreaming on
in the middle of the day
You are you are you are my love

You took my breath away
I donât know what to say
We are we are we are shaked up

[Chorus:]
Iâm hanging on hanging on
because our love is strong
I can feel that this is real for good
I wanna file your pretty smile
because you turn me on
Itâs in the air no need to knock on wood

You keep me sing along
to the rhythm of your heart beat
We are we are we are complete

Inside my head I know
there is no easy way to go
You are you are you are the heat

[Chorus:]
Iâm hanging on still hanging on
because our love is strong
I can feel that this is real for good
I wanna file your pretty smile
because you turn me on
Itâs in the air no need to knock on wood

[Release:]
You are you are you are â¦
My love
We are we are we are
lovers beneath the stars
Kissing the universe above

Still loving you
Still â¦ for always will Still loving you
Still â¦ for ever will Still â¦
