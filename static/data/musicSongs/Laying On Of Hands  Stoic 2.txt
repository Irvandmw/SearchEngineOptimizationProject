Lyrics:


Mother Theresa understood the laying on of hands
What I often wonder is how she kept from hearing loveâs demands
If in her loneliness she ever dreamed of following earthly commands, oh yeah.
Mother Theresa understood the laying on of hands.

Touch is a language. What it you have to say to me?
Come and talk about it. Tell me where youâre locked and where youâre free.
Brutality or tenderness, our bodies are exchanged in all eternity, oh yeah.
Touch is a language. What is it you have to say to me?
In this wilderness do we hurt or heal within our daily plans, oh yeah.
Mother Theresa understood the laying on of hands.
Mother Theresa understood the laying on of hands
Mother Theresa understood the laying on of hands.

Epictetus probably slept with hands above the covers
Lost no sleep in counting sheep or numbers of ex-lovers.
The thing about a stoic is heâs always understated
I donât know about happiness but virtueâs overrated.

La la la la
La la la la
