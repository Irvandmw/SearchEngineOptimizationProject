Lyrics:


(R. Rodgers - L. Hart)
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon...
Without a love of my own
