Big L rest in peace...

2 A.M., just got outta the bar, headed to my car
Me and Castro kind of blown 'cus we parked so far
Walkin' down the street, spot a couple of goonies on the creek
Pockets full of cash, so we dash fast, to avoid they ass
Cause we know they trailin' now we on the run
Heavily inhaling, exhaling as I begin to caress my gun
We gettin' closer to our destination
I always mind my business but, somehow I find myself in these situations
Death what I'm facin' if I give up now
They startin' poppin so you know we exchangin' bullets in the street
He dropped one but, I graze another
And in the heat of the moment I thought about my girl and how much I love her
Prayin' to god that tonight wasn't my last supper
Cause they tryin' to spill my blood and break me for this bread
Motherfucker take all this lead, yeah that's what I said
That's 2 down and 2 to go
But, then the others disappeared yo
So, now we on the roll, finally made it back to the car
My homie thinkin' that we all good but, hold up there they are
Buckin' fast in the XLR
Goddamn what a mission
Thought process, keys to ignition
Try to ditch 'em, so now we in the whip speedin'
Dodgin' bullets as we proceedin'
'To my man lenbo
These bammers try to play us like nintendo, hell no
Hit him on the phone, let him know we wasn't alone
Comin' through the zone, my homie picked up before the dial tone
"Whaddup my man, what's good? Is everything ok?"
Hell naw, get your heater and be ready to spray
Pulled up to his crib and my man was ready to go, ha
Jumped in the back with a semi-automatic
Bustin' eratic, quite the lethal weapon addict
So, we let 'em have it
Weaving in and out of traffic until we lost 'em
Whippin' for a couple of minutes wishin' we could've tossed
So now I'm drivin, thankin' god that I'm still survivin'
Received the call from my man boss, he was chillin' and vibin'
Said he was on the road, found out about a pack of waves
So, I said that's getup, I got a story that'll blow you away
Couple minutes passed, met up at a red light
Called him on his celly celler
"Lets hit the deli and grab a bite"
So, now it's me lenbo and Castro inside of my car
Plus, my homie boss trailin' behind us but, not too far
Now we on the strip, everybody coolin' they jets
'Til I hear my man Castro yell out "oh shit"
Here come the motherfuckers again out the blue like a crip
They must've followed us tryin' to take out the whole lot of us
Now they bustin' at boss
Movin' through the tired and I made them crash
Now they comin' for ours
I hit the uuee while, my man blast
Hit the passenger in the door, now his brains up on the dash
The driver stopped, tryin' to clean the blood up off the glass
Givin' us just enough time to go and pick up boss' ass
All together, started raining I hate this weather
But it didn't matter, only thing on my mind is vendetta
Cause that was for the one
He scared as shit but, we chasin' sun
Hit the highway, doin' it up by a buck and some
Castro halfway up the sunroof firin'
No fear, so, I guess that's what I do admire him
Duckin' Strays, 'til he caught one in the shoulder
Fell back, gushin' blood, but, my man's a soldier
He hit the exit, now we whippin' through the city
Contemplating, how the situations getting shitty
Now we out of ammo, so. we sped up to the side of his ride
And tended to collide hit him quick and watched the whip slide
My man boss strapped the gat from lenbo half out the window
Shot the gas tank, we watched the whole thing blow
Now we laughin' headed to the hospital for Castro

Oh no, I guess popo got wind of the blow
Cause like 15 cars came out of nowhere yo
And now they on pursuit, didn't even hesitate to shoot
Murder weapon possession in the trunk for the loot
If we get caught it's either life or death so fuck 'em
Might as well go out blazin' we might just duck 'em
Hit a hard right, goin 120 through a warehouse
Hit the lights in the engine so, they don't know our where abouts
Just around the corner was a bridge out of the city
No cops in sight, me and my homies feelin' giddy
My man, Castro, was like fuck them coppers
But, speak of the devil 'cause appearred two choppers
They lights on us, callin' out cars to our location
Mind racin', checked the rearview
Saw every cop from the fuckin' station
And what was comin' and the bridge was risin'
You shoulda saw it, told my boys to buckle up cause I'm about to floor it
Everything was perfectly aligned and we was at a good speed
My homie lenbo didn't hesitate to spark the good weed
Feelin' like I'm home free halfway up the ramp
Escape is my goal, but, open fire hit the tire
Now we outta control, off of the bridge we go

(Logic, yo Logic, yo wake up man, Logic, yo wake up man, Logic, wake up man)
Wassup?
(We're finally here, man)
Oh
(The studio, let's go)
Oh, alright, alright
I had the craziest fucking dream, dawg
