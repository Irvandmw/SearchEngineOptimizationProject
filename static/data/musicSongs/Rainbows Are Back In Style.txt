Lyrics:


Rainbows are gettin' back in style
There's sunshine everywhere and I'm learning how to smile
The only time it rains is to cool things for a while
But since I met you I can't forget you the rainbows are back in style.

There's not a thing in the world that I'd rather do
Than just sit and stare at your face
You're so doggone pretty that you made the world
A whole lot happier place.

Life's worth living and the love that you're giving
Has made me feel this way
And rainbows have chased
The clouds away.

Rainbows are gettin' back in style
There's sunshine everywhere and I'm learning how to smile
The only time it rains is to cool things for a while
But since I met you I can't forget you the rainbows are back in style.

Your name is like music and I can't help singing it over and over again
This happy feeling has got me thinking it's heaven I'm living in
The love we share puts magic in the air and every dream comes true
And rainbows have turned my skies to blue.

Rainbows are gettin' back in style
There's sunshine everywhere and I'm learning how to smile
The only time it rains is to cool things for a while
But since I met you I can't forget you the rainbows are back in style.

But since I met you I can't forget you the rainbows are back in style...
