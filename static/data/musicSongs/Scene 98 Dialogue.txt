Lyrics:


[Jackson:]
You know why? You're too worried about what everybody else is thinkin'. You can't even concentrate on one fuckin' thing, man. That's right. Yeah. You couldn't be my dad if you fuckin' tried. He had more talent in his fuckin' finger than you have in your whole fuckin' body, so don't even go there about that, all right? That's over the fuckin' line

[Ally:]
Why don't you have another drink, and we can get fucking drunk until we fuckin' disappear, okay? Hey, do you got those pills in your pocket?

[Jackson:]
You're just fuckin' ugly, that's all

[Ally:]
I'm what?

[Jackson:]
You're just fuckin' ugly

[Ally:]
Get the fuck out! Get out! I said get out!
