Lyrics:


I'm a wild child, bright child
Knockin' at your door
You thought that you were done
But now you want me even more
Dum dum
You want me even more
Dum dum

I'm a star child, big smile
Livin' in LA
I'm comin' over baby
You can't go to school today
Dum dum
Go to school today
Dum dum

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Scarlett O'Hara
Of the downtown scene
'Cause I just wanna dream
I just wanna drink

I'm a pop-blues singer
Fam-bam zinger
Mansfield ringer
From the Hollywood silver screen
Silver screen

Once you've had something
Something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed

I'm a wild child, sky high
Lyin' on your floor
I know I had a lot
But baby, what's a little more
Dum dum
Want a little more
Dum dum

In my white mink
Pink cigarettes from the store
We're making robberies
From Tijuana to the shore
Dum dum
'Juana to the shore
Dum dum

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Bugsy Malone
Of the deep Sahara
'Cause I'm on the scene
Yeah, I'm on the scene

I'm a bad jazz singer
Givin' you the finger
No matter what you linger
'Cause you like me even when I'm mean
I'm the queen

Once you've had something
Something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed

Once you've had something
Something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed

Once you've had something
Something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed

Once you've had something
Something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed
