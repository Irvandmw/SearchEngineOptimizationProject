Lyrics:


Just wanna taste the kiss
And you the girl that's got my heart in this
And it's no way you can get away with it
You need to come sit down, listen to what I gotta say
I need one more fantasy
All I see, is you've been dreamin'
Girl, you make your sweet love to me
And I can't help that I'm impatient, girl

Baby, I'm right where I wanna be
Girl, we ain't never finished
I'm tryna make love for eternity
So baby, just sit me where you want me
Please fuck me forever
In the sheets, baby, pillow fight
We gon do it all night

I'ma make you cry a little bit
Girl, I know that you're a freak
I'ma make you ride, hop on me
Follow me a little later, right to the fuckin' bedroom
Body rubbing all on me
When we in the bedroom
The way you do that girl you remind me of something
Let me sex you up, when we in the bedroom, sex you up

And girl, I only wanna love you, baby
So write your name on the dotted line
Girl if you shy, you don't have to be ashamed
Baby I won't yell, until you yell
Just lay your head down
I'ma put this love on you
I'ma show you, just what you wanted, girl
I'm not going nowhere, not going nowhere

Baby, I'm right where I wanna be
Girl, we ain't never finished
I'm tryna make love for eternity
So baby, just sit me where you want me
Please fuck me forever
In the sheets, baby, pillow fight
We can do it all night

I'ma make you cry a little bit
Girl, I know that you're a freak
I'ma make you ride, hop on me
Follow me a little later, right to the fuckin' bedroom (follow me, follow me)
Body rubbing all on me
When we in the bedroom (when we in the bedroom)
The way you do that, girl, you remind me of something
Let me sex you up, when we in the bedroom, sex you up

Girl, I'm sitting here, waiting alone for you
And you got what I need
Girl, I'ma take it slow, take it nice and slow
Come on baby, your dreams will come true for the night
And we're on this magic mountain
I hope you're ready to climb

I'ma make you cry a little bit
Girl, I know that you're a freak
I'ma make you ride, hop on me
Follow me a little later, right to the fuckin' bedroom
Body rubbing all on me
When we in the bedroom
The way you do that girl you remind me of something
Let me sex you up, when we in the bedroom, sex you up
