Lyrics:


I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl
I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl

International no specific area code 
Whether it's them project homes 
Overseas on them cobble-stone roads
I can just about upload what you need and all the essentials 
Believe me I'm what you looking for 
Login B backslash O N C each day baby

I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl
I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl

If it's like a MAC you own maximize the full potential 
Baby if you connect with me I'm just like your high-speed cable
Even if you gotta fly to where they drive on the passenger side 
I'll be the like the Autobahn when you get on you won't know how to let go

Browsing won't do 
You got to click right here come find me
I'll assure you 
The places you've never been I'll take you

I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl
I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl

I want love like any world-wide woman would need
I know you think that can't be
Still got sensitivity
In my world, it's hard to get authenticity
But you feel so damn real to me
Come take the lead
Enjoy this world with me

I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl
I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl

I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl
I'm a world-wide woman WWW
You can log on anywhere
Your girl can take you there
World-wide woman WWW
You know I'm the type of girl

I'm a world-wide woman
I'm a world-wide woman
I'm a world-wide woman
I'm a world-wide woman
