Lyrics:


[Chorus:]
Hark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
To the new born King

In Excelsis Deo
Gloria...
In Excelsis Deo

[Chorus]

In Excelsis Deo
