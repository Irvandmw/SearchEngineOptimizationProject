Lyrics:


Advertise in imaginative ways
Start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike
It is that easy

Lunar surface on a Saturday night
Dressed up in silver and white
With coloured "Old Grey Whistle Test" lights

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus
It's all getting gentrified

I put a taqueria on the roof
It was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the starlight express
The head of special effects
In my mind's eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget
Doesn't time fly?

I'm in no position to give advice
I don't wanna be nice
And you know that

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up Around Clavius
It's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise
The old headquarters

All the nights that never happened
And the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
Only time that we stop laughing
Is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus
It's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio
(The Information-Action Ratio)
Is the place to go
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Now, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius
It's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon
(The Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five

(Take it easy for a little while)
Four stars out of five
