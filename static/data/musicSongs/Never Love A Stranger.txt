Lyrics:


Love at first sight only makes you blind
First you lose your senses
Then you drop your self-defenses in time

Head over heels is a big mistake
Suddenly you're falling
And ecstasy is calling your name

Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time

One goodnight kiss and it won't be long
When arms are intertwined
It's so difficult to find something wrong

One night of fun and you come undone
Anyone can hurt you
Better hold on to your virtue and run

Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time

We never see the forest for the trees
We always fall in love with first impressions
Words in the night seem to vanish with the light
And you wake up and you're all alone
There's no one home

Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time

Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time to grow
