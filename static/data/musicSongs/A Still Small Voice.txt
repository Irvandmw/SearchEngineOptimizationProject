Lyrics:


A still small voice will speak to you one day. 
A still small voice will call to you and say, 
"I am the earth, the sky, the brightest star on high, 
the tallest tree, the smallest drop of dew." 
A still small voice one day will say to you! 

The still small voice from every voice apart, 
Will whisper in the language of your heart, 

"I am the night, the day, the blessing and the way, 
the dream that keeps a lonely heart aglow!" 
Once you have heard the word a still small voice will say, 
your heart will answer, 
"Yes, I know!"
