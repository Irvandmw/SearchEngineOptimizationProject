Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

Stir it up, porridge
Getting dope, so rich
Ah smoke it
And I ain't never liked a broke bitch
I ain't never fuck with ya hoe bitch
Quiet down

Oh-oh-oh shit
So-oh-oh rich
Eye low, I'm so loaded
Eyes, pose bitch

Take it off
Wanna see you work it, oh, my god (pose bitch)
And that thing is out I know you know (pose bitch)
And you bounce it like I know you know
Bitch, I know you know
Bitch, I know you know
Stay low
All my haters so, so broke
Pipe down
All these niggas so, so broke (so, so broke, pose bitch)

Oh-oh-oh shit
So loaded
Eye low
I am so lit
Eyes, pose bitch

Yes, bitch
Let me see you get it no no no
Flexing I know that you with it
Pose bitch

Flick, flick, flick, for fucking sho doe
All you lame ass bitches is a no go
And if you with it go fuckin' loco, loco

Oh-oh-oh shit
So loaded
Eye low
I am so lit
Eyes, pose bitch
