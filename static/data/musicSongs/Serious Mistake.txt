Lyrics:


I am not a church going man, but father please won't you hear my confession.
There's a situation at hand though I have sinned won't you teach me a lesson.
I deserve nothing less than the worst you can do,
Father please make me more like you.

I've made a serious mistake,
I hope its not too late to fix the heart I'm breaking.
I've made a serious mistake,
I hope its not too late to fix the heart I'm breaking.
I've made a mistake.

I am not a church going man, but I'm in desperate need of forgiveness.
I've lost track of who I really am,
My own mother won't believe that I've did this.
I deserve nothing less than the worst you can do,
Father please make me more like you

I've made a serious mistake,
I hope its not too late to fix the heart I'm breaking.
I've made a serious mistake,
I hope its not too late to fix the heart I'm breaking.
I've made a mistake

ooohh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh

I keep on letting myself down.
Even the rats say they don't want me around.
But every heart will someday break,
Everyone will make mistakes, wanna live with no regrets,
walk the fine line between love and sex.
I deserve nothing less than the worst you can do.
Father please make me more like you.

I've made a serious mistake,
I hope its not too late to fix the heart I'm breaking.
I've made a mistake

To fix the heart I'm breaking
I've made a serious mistake
And I hope its not too late to fix the heart
I'm breaking
I'm breaking
I'm breaking
I've made a mistake

I am not a church going man but Father please won't you hear my confessions.
