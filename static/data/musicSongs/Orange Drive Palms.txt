Lyrics:


I try, I lie, I try, super lie

Someone's sphincter in my eye
Kick it with that rebel cat, and I want it to be that
I'm feeling slightly down, I'm looking up from the ground
While confusion strains my mind, I contemplate this time
Thinking about a future, hemming it with a suture
Dog shitting on the sign, could the head below be mine?

Sign, could the head below be mine? [x3]

I try, I lie, super lie
Someone's sphincter in my eye
Remember the palms [x8]

Kick it with that rebel cat, and I want it to be that
I'm feeling slightly down, I'm looking up from the ground
While confusion strains my mind, I contemplate this time
Thinking about a future, hemming it with a suture
Dog shitting on the sign, could the head below be mine?

Sign, could the head below be mine? [x3]

Orange drive is where these palms lie
Making me sick, making me want to get high
Under the palms [x8]

Kick it with that rebel cat, and I want it to be that
I'm feeling slightly down, I'm looking up from the ground
While confusion strains my mind, I contemplate this time
Thinking about a future, hemming it with a suture
Dog shitting on the sign, could the head below be mine?

Sign, could the head below be mine? [x7]

I try, I try, super lie
Someone's sphincter in my eye
I try, I lie, I try
Someone's sphincter in my eye

Kick it with that rebel cat, and I want it to be that
I'm feeling slightly down, I'm looking up from the ground
While confusion strains my mind, I contemplate this time
Thinking about a future, hemming it with a suture
Dog shitting on the sign, could the head below be mine?

Sign, could the head below be mine? [x3]

I try, I lie, super lie
Someone's sphincter into my eye
[x5]

Orange drive is where these palms lie
Making me sick, making me want to get high
[3x]

Orange drive is where these palms lie
Someone's sphincter in my eye
