Lyrics:


I was stopped in London when I felt it coming down
Crushing all around me with a great triumphant sound
Like the dam was breaking and my mind came rushing in
I was stopped in London, oh, I was awakening
I was

I was so embarrassed and I almost ran away
Two times round the block before I decided to stay
Puffed along a cigarette that went and made me sick
Spent another day pretending I was over it

This time I know I'm fighting
This time I know I'm (back in my body)
This time I know I'm fighting
This time I know I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh

And all along the highway there's a tiny whispering sound
Saying I could find you in the dark of any town
But though that I am here and in the poem of my mind
The silent, twisted words finding their way in every line
All this time, all this time

This time I know I'm fighting
This time I know I'm (back in my body)
This time I know I'm fighting
This time I know I'm (back in my body)
Lost you in the border town of anywhere 
I found myself when I was going everywhere
This time I know I'm fighting
This time I know I'm

(Back in my body, oh, oh)
(Back in my body, oh, oh)
(Back in my body, oh, oh)

All this time, all this time
All this time, all this time
All this time, all this time
All this time, all this time

This time I know I'm fighting
This time I know I'm (back in my body)
This time I know I'm fighting
This time I know I'm (back in my body)
Lost you in the border town of anywhere
I found myself when I was going everywhere
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm back in my body, oh
Back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh
Back in my body, oh, oh
