Lyrics:


Stuck in a moment,
At ten past nine,
Don't know if she's showing,
I wish she would tell me what was on her mind,
I can't stand not knowing.
Why am I here?

She used to say I was the love of her life,
Lately she ain't showing,
I used to say she's gonna to make a good wife,
Where is this thing going?
Why am I here?
Why am I here?

(Every word)
Every word I write,
I can't help losing myself
(With Every Kiss)
Every kiss goodnight,
I can't help losing myself,
I can't help losing myself, In you.

Stuck in a moment that was 10:09,
No way she is showing,
These games that she plays,
aren't even worth my time,
Where is this thing going?
Why am I here?
Why am I here?

(With Every word)
Every word I write,
I can't help losing myself
(With Every Kiss)
Every kiss goodnight,
I can't help losing myself, In you.

Well you don't wanna let me go,
But you can't have it both ways, no,
What can I do?
'Cause I can't help falling,
And I can't stop calling you.
What can I do?

(With Every word)
Every word I write,
I can't help losing myself
(With Every Kiss)
Every kiss goodnight,
I can't help losing myself

(Every time) 
Every time We fight,
I can't do anything right
(When we say)
When we say goodbye
I can't help losing myself,
I can't help losing myself, In you.
