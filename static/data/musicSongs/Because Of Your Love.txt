Lyrics:


Baby I don't understand
With just a touch of your hand 
Can make me feel invincible
Do you know just where you take me
Do you know how high you make me
I need your kiss like oxygen
With your arms warm around me
When your eyes look deep into me
It's unstoppable 
Baby anything is possible

Everything I wanna be 
Any dream I wanna dream I can
Because of your love
Anywhere I ever go 
With all of my heart I know
I am the man I am
Because of your love

Don't know how I lived before you
Now I live to explore you
Take me girl to your secret world
Where I could swim in your deep blue passion
Or I could feel your love come crashing over me endlessly
Whether you're right by my side or
Whether you and I are a million miles apart
I can always feel you in my heart

Everything I wanna be 
Any dream I wanna dream I can
Because of your love
Anywhere I ever go 
With all of my heart I know
I am the man I am
Because of your love

Everything I wanna be 
Any dream I wanna dream I can
Because of your love
Anywhere I ever go 
With all of my heart I know
I am the man I am
Because of your love

Oh baby
Because of your love
