Song Name: The Poor People Of Paris
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Just got back from Paris France
All they do is sing and dance
All they got is romance
What a tragedy
Every boulevard has lovers
Every lover's in a trance
The poor people of Paris

I feel sorry for the French
Every guy has got a wench
Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French
The poor people of Paris

Milk or water from a sink
Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink
And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think
The poor people of Paris

Sister Madam Pierre
Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly
Pierre was there to bid her farewell
But he brought his new girl Claire
The poor people of Paris

So don't go to Paris France
Not unless you like to dance
Not unless you want romance
Like those poor inhabitants of Paris

[Spoken:] In the meantime, I got to hurry back there
I think I forgot something....
