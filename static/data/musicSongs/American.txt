Lyrics:


Where's your honor, where's my pride?
Even when it's hard to find
From seed to harvest, it's been engrained

Drive me past the fields of corn
As Johnny Cash blasts in your Ford
Just get me home to catch the big game

Cause I was born an American
On the same dark soil
Through the years & all the changes
Still there's no place like home

I will die an American

It's fireflies & times of war
I think back to a time before
Of catching fireflies in my hands

Then it seems I grew up in a flash
A copper penny flying off a track
Free to fall in love with any man

Cause I was born an American
On the same dark soil
Through the years & all the changes
Still there's no place like home

I was born an American
And tho I've growin' old
Through the years & all the changes
Still there's no place like home

And I will die an American
