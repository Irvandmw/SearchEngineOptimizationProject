Lyrics:


(Ouh, backwoods rolled different)
Ayy, know what time it is
Look, ayy
Hah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, ayy (Shoot), lil' nigga

I've been trappin' trappin' since I had a beeper nigga (Yah)
When I was ballin' you was sittin' in the bleachers nigga (Yah)
And I can't do these "Hello, nice to meet you" niggas (Yah)
If you run up on me he gon' change ya features nigga (Woo)
Point 'em out, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot
Point 'em out, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot
Point 'em out, who-who-who-who-who-who
Point 'em out, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot
Point 'em out

Which one, big one, he ain't gettin' to it like [?]
He ain't ever ball, like he was on a bench
I was shootin' them tree's like Dwayne (Dwayne)
Trap phone job like who-who
His phone off, can't relay (Yah)
Plug just got [?] like every day
So fine, just point I shoot-shoot
Leave these niggas on mute
Money gon' talk like uh-uh
Got married to the money, I do (I do)
Got a lil' baby that's cute (Cute)
Better die before I do it like you (Do it like you)
Can't tell my nigga my sins (Nigga my sins)
Gotta leave 'em in the desert like [?]
No this ain't the gram', so stop with the cappin'
Wanna get blamin' and that's not a caption
See his reaction after I trapped him
RIP to him, his name ain't a status
Get hit with the stick, I ain't talkin' Madden
I took his bitch, 'cause she love the fashion
I got the drip, you see me splashin'
My niggas lit, you niggas has beens

I've been trappin' trappin' since I had a beeper nigga (Yah)
When I was ballin' you was sittin' in the bleachers nigga (Yah)
And I can't do these "Hello, nice to meet you" niggas (Yah)
If you run up on me he gon' change ya features nigga (Woo)
Point 'em out, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot
Point 'em out, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot
Point 'em out, who-who-who-who-who-who
Point 'em out, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot
Point 'em out

Yeah yeah, gotta keep one in the head, yeah
Brody got one in the head
Two make 'em move then it's over he dead, yeah
Heard of a stupid ass goofy ass nigga tryna plot and he was my mans, yeah
We could've got money together
I love you my nigga but now you're a dead man
We could've been ballin' together, instead I just put a red dot to his headband
I was just duckin' from feds
Up in the jetski and hittin' the staircase
My cuban link choked on my neck
This akhi is tucked, you can't touch but it's heavy
My chain like a hockey but you movin' wocky
I'm covered in ice like I'm Gretsky

I've been trappin' trappin' since I had a beeper nigga (Yah)
When I was ballin' you was sittin' in the bleachers nigga (Yah)
And I can't do these "Hello, nice to meet you" niggas (Yah)
If you run up on me he gon' change ya features nigga (Woo)
Point 'em out, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot
Point 'em out, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot
Point 'em out, who-who-who-who-who-who
Point 'em out, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot
Point 'em out

Yeah, yeah, yeah
One in the, head-head-head (Pa-pow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One in the
