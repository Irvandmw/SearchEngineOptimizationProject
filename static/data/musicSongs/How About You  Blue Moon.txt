Lyrics:


I like New York in June how about you
I like a Gershwin tune how about you
I like a fireside when a storm is due
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips how about you
I'm mad about good books can't get my thrill
And James Durante's looks give me a thrill

[movie dialog]

You saw me standing alone
Without a dream of my own
Without love
