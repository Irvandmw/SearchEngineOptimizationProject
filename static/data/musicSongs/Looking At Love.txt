Lyrics:
Lyrics:


A man stands next to at great wall
He's too close he can't see at all
But if he doesn't stand so near
The bigger picture become so clear
I've been so into myself now
In my world I saw nothing else
So many times I made you cry
I never knew the reason why

I couldn't face the truth that was inside
But as the world is turning
You know I'm slowly learning

[Chorus:]
Looking at love from a different view
Seeing my self the way you do
Checking my self checking myself searching my soul
Looking at love through anothers eyes
Seeing things I never realize
Kicking my self kicking my self I was
But now I'm looking at love

I stared deep into the mirror
A hard look I ain't no hero
For the first time I can see
How hard it's been to love a man like me
Your give me love with no conditions
Your trust me with no suspicios
I know I haven't done the same
I never really sww your pain

I couldn't face the truth that was inside
But as the world is turning
You know I'm slowly learning

[Chorus:]
Looking at love from a different view
Seeing my self the way you do
Checking my self checking myself searching my soul
Looking at love through anothers eyes
Seeing things I never realize
Kicking my self kicking my self I was
But now I'm looking at love
