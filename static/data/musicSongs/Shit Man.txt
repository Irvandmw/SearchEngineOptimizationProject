Lyrics:


[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
Youâre never ready for
Something quite like this
It comes to hit you when you
Are least expectinâ it
So now what happens if I choose
To have this child, have a child with you?
Do you believe that we can make it through?

[Chorus]
How we gonna do this thing?
How we gonna do it? Shit, man!
We donât even got no ring
And we donât got the money, shit, man!
Weâre gonna need a bigger house
Weâve got a lot to figure out
How we gonna do this thing?
How we gonna do it? Shit, man!

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
Sometimes it still feels like
Weâre just a couple of kids
Afraid of growinâ up, yeah,
Afraid to say âthis is itâ
So now I donât know what Iâll do
But Iâm so in love so in love with you
Can you believe this is happening so soon?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
This ainât what I expected,
Ainât happeninâ like I thought it,
And if they say, âlove is free,â
Then tell me why the fuck its costinâ
And yes, it happens often and I should cope with my losses
And you say youâre not ready
I donât believe in abortions
My heart, light as a feather
I know things can get better
I know your visionâs cloudy
So much inclement weather
I know that faith is a string thatâs slowly coming untethered,
But we can get through anything together

[Chorus]
