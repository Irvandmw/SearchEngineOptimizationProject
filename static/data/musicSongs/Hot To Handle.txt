Lyrics:


She's setting me on fire
As I watch her move
She's reading my desire
If she gets her way she's gonna make me pay 

She is thunder and she's lightning boy
Electricity and sweat
This kind of woman is frightning me
I wanna take her home but I already know 

[Chorus:]
She's too hot
Hot to handle
The fuse is burning away
Smoke is there
Hanging in the air
This game is dangerous to play 

I'm loosing all my senses now
Forgetting space and time
She's stolen all my defences now
I wanna take her home but I already know 

[Chorus:]
She's too hot
Hot to handle
The fuse is burning away
Smoke is there
Hanging in the air
This game is dangerous to play 

I know there's gonna be a sensory explosion
Tasting fantasies into the night
Can't help it now this girl is touching my emotions
It could be so easy
It could be so right
