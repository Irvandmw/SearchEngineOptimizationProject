Lyrics:


I hear the wind call my name
The sound that leads me home again
It sparks up the fire, a flame that still burns
To you I will always return

I know the road is long
But where you are is home
Wherever you stay,
I'll find the way

I'll run like the river,
I'll follow the sun
I'll fly like an eagle
To where I belong

I can't stand the distance
I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you
Yes, I'm on my way home

Now I know it's true
My every road leads to you
And in the hour of darkness
Your light gets me through

You run like the river
You shine like the sun
You fly like an eagle
Yeah, you are the one

I've seen every sunset
And with all that I've learned
It's to you I will always, always return
