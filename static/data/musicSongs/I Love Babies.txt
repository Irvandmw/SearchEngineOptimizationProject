Lyrics:


Abort, abort, abort, abort
No more babies

And 1,2,3,4 popping to the doctor
Killing some babies, killing some mommas
To abort
Many babies, I love babies, fooling with a baby, just two, baby
To abort.. your baby

Abort, abort, abort, abort
No more babies

5,6,7,8 stay home and masturbate
Gotta like your dick, gotta like your dick, gotta like your dick
To abort
Call me a little Jew, me and you, a cup or two
Come a little closer and I'll wrench your neck
Your baby's neck

Abort, abort, abort, abort
No more babies

You can't treat a human like a test-tube monkey so
You can choke, take control from a strung out junkie
To abort

You can't treat a human like a test-tube monkey so
You can choke, take control from a strung out junkie
To abort your baby

Abort, abort, abort, abort
No more babies
