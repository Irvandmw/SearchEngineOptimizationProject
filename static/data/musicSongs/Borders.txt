[SAINt JHN & {Lenny Kravitz}:]
Baby, let's close up
Baby, come close to me, don't create borders
Take me in comfortably, don't be difficult
Baby girl, who hurt you? Don't be miserable
Baby, let me love you, baby let's close up
{Baby, come close to me, don't create borders
Take me in comfortably, don't be difficult
Baby girl, who hurt you? Don't be miserable
Baby, let me love you}

[SAINt JHN:]
I'm tryna find my God these days, I pray to God we all behave
I just been on my Holly ways, I just been on a gnarly wave
I got a place in Hollywood, further than where we thought we would
Told Lee he'd be a millionaire, I'm 'bout to make my promise good
I'm gettin' closer to the dream, girl, I'm tryin'
Land on the feet, I can fly, ayy
Top off, hands in the sky, ayy
Champagne pain for the diet
Damn, and it ain't even Friday
Bet he got a Porsche on the highway
Top off, hands in the sky, ayy
Pray don't nobody violate

[{Lenny Kravitz} & SAINt JHN:]
{Baby, come close to me, don't create borders
Take me in comfortably, don't be difficult
Baby girl, who hurt you?} Don't be miserable
Baby, let me love you, baby, let's close up
Baby, come close to me, don't create borders
Take me in comfortably, don't be difficult
Baby girl, who hurt you? If this isn't love
You should let me love you

[Lenny Kravitz:]
I just wanted you sometimes, no lie
When the lies is good, you don't wanna hear the truth sometimes, sometimes
I don't wanna just seem, I don't wanna be shootin' blind, true crime
Even if it ain't right, right now, the illusion's fine, oh my
You hear that I'm on the way, you know to just keep the lights on
I know you want me to stay, 'cause I feel the same when the night's gone
And on the chance you don't, you should know I try
Keep your borders closed, but keep an open mind, well then...

[{Lenny Kravitz} & SAINt JHN:]
{Baby, come close to me, don't create borders
Take me in comfortably, don't be difficult
Baby, girl who hurt you?} Don't be miserable
Baby, let me love you, baby, dance closer
Baby, come close to me, don't create borders
Say what you want from me, don't be difficult
Baby girl, who hurt you? If this isn't love
You should let me love you
