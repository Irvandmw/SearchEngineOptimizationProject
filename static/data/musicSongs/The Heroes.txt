Lyrics:


1 2 3 4
You're last and we come first
We're not scared of anyone
Masters of the universe
And we're here to have fun

Be advised and be afraid
We're here on a crusade 
So, just go crying to your mama
We're stronger than your papa

Can't you see that we're awesome?
Infinitely awesome
About now you should already know that
We're the heroes
We're the heroes
We're the heroes

We'll take over the loon
Have a cake and eat it too
We'll be victorious
Cause we're strong and glorious

Can't you see that we're awesome?
Infinitely awesome
About now you should already know that
We're the heroes
We're the heroes
We're the heroes

Be advised and be afraid
We're here on a crusade 
So, just go crying to your mama
We're stronger than your papa

Can't you see that we're awesome?
Infinitely awesome
About now you should already know that
We're the heroes
We're the heroes
We're the heroes
We're the heroes
