Song Name: Lovers Never Die
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You said forever after
But what came after that
Wasn't what I expected
I expected you back
You said that you're romantic
Where's the romance in this?
It's obvious that you're full of it

I tried to give it time
But then our time slipped away
You said that you'd be fine
But finally I'm awake
You said it's only habit
But what happened is this
It's obvious I'm not having it

You said the pretty things you know I like
But I can read between the lines
If lovers never die then why do I need you?
Believe when I see you
Whenever I see you
It kills me inside
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?

I trust too easily
I trusted you'd treat me well
I've faced the truth but facing you Iâm asking for help
You played the gentleman
But there's no gentle in this
It's obvious you're full of it

You said the pretty things you know I like
But I can read between the lies
If lovers never die then why do I need you?
Believe when I see you
Whenever I see you
It kills me inside
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?

It was just a lie
But I survived
Why do you say goodbye if lovers never die?

If lovers never die then why do I need you?
Believe when I see you
Whenever I see you
It kills me inside
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?
