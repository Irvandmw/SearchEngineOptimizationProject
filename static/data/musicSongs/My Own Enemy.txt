Lyrics:


Hold up
Oh no
Who let them in the door
It's like a freak show
Shake it like a photo

Hate
Is only what you say
Not what you mean
And pain
Is what's inside of me
Not when you're bleeding
I will fall
I'll fall
And take your breath away
We could change it all
And take your breath away

This anger changes me
It affects the way I see
Affects every part of me
And makes you my enemy
But when it falls apart
It's like a brand new start
And I can't remember why
I ripped everything apart

[chorus]
I'm still my worst enemy
The world around me
All can see what they want to see
I need some help
Because I'm still my worst enemy
No matter where I am
I'll still get the best of my
I'm my own enemy

Shake
The world inside of me
Until it can't be shaken
Wake
The words inside of me
Before it's all too late

I will fall
I'll fall
And take your breath away
We will change it all
And take your breath away

This anger changes me
It affects the way I see
Affects every part of me
And makes you my enemy
But when it falls apart
It's like a brand new start
And I can't remember why
I ripped everything apart

[chorus]

My own enemy
My own enemy
