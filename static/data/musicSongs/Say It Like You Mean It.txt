Lyrics:


All this noise of rock and roll
Feels a lot like weâre ready to fold
Feels a lot like weâve lost the goal
Lost our minds and lost the soul of a nation

A couple lost generations
Weâre the ones lost and losing patience
Iâm still looking for a correlation
Between what to say and how you roll

Spit it out
âYeah, spit it out

Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
But I still donât believe it

Oh my soul, wonder whereâd you go?
It never did feel like my control
I never could fit in microphones
I never could fit in stop and stand ovations

Give me the songs of the nation
Cause it feels like law lacks motivation
See, Iâm still looking for a correlation
Between what you say and how you roll

Spit it out
âLike you mean it
Spit it out

You say it like you mean it
But I still donât believe it
