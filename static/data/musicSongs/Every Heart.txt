Lyrics:


We're all lookin' for a message here
A little wisdom on a souvenir
Another bottle with an S.O.S
Throw it in the water and pray for the best
There ain't a compass or a northern star
That ever really tells us where we are
We're just a shore runnin' out of sand
And reachin' for a hand

Every heart is an island
But no one's alone
Ship wrecked in a high wind
Tryin' to find our way home
And every tear is an ocean
We're all brothers in a storm
And we're tyrin' to survive it
Lookin' for dry land
Every heart is an island

Silverlinin' is kinda hard to find
When the world stops at the horizon line
There ain't a harbor that you'll recognize
It's hard to make a wish in an empty sky
Boardwalks are just nails and wood
The pretty and a picture when times are good
Cars and boats are just on loan
Our house is just sticks and stones

Every heart is an island
But no one's alone
Ship wrecked in a high wind
Tryin' to find our way home
And every tear is an ocean
We're all brothers in a storm
And we're tyrin' to survive it
Lookin' for dry land
Every heart is an island

Every heart is an island
And no one's alone
Ship wrecked in a high wind
Tryin' to find our way home
And every tear is an ocean
We're all brothers in a storm
And we're tyrin' to survive it
Lookin' for dry land
Every heart is an island
Every heart is an island
