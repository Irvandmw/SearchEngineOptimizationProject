Lyrics:


Now I know you're deceiving
You know everything I'm believing
I keep tied to your wheel
I serve on your leash
You make me do anything

Run away, run away, run away
Fly away, fly away, fly away bird

Your spirit is a wonder
You control as a master
As powers under your manipulative reach

Run away, run away, run away
Fly away, fly away, fly away bird
I said run away, run away, run away
Fly away, fly away, fly away bird

Oh the love you feel by your side
All the love you feel by your side
All the love you feel by your side
It's running away at the pace of the night
Oh yes it is now

Like we hurtin' for stealing
Had you paying for something you don't need
They pose the deliverer of the image of your dream
But the pain is always in your range

Run away, run away, run away
Fly away, fly away, fly away bird
I said run away, run away, run away
Fly away, fly away, fly away bird

All the love you feel by your side
All the love you feel by your side
All the love you feel by your side
It's running away at the pace of the night

Mmm, running, running, running, running
Mmm, running, running, running, running
Mmm, running, running, running, running
Sister keep running
Running, running, running, running
Oh no, oh no
I been runnin'
