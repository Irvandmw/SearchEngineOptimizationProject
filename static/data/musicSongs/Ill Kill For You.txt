Lyrics:


I can only hear the voice from deep inside me
Tells me to pull the trigger
And I can't hear the folks around me screaming
For God sake what are you doing?
It must be the heat - I'm sorry

I can only see a bad and evil monster
Flickering in front of my eyes
At the moment I don't remember that he
He used to be a good friend
'Cause he is my girlfriend's lover

It's just, it's just desperation - I'll kill for you
It's just, it's just desperation - I'll kill for you

I can only fell there is an invisible power
Tearing up our love to pieces
And I get the feeling that everybody's laughing
And talking behind our backs
It must be the heat - I'm sorry

It's just, it's just desperation - I'll kill for you
It's just, it's just desperation - I'll kill for you

Thoughts are coming thoughts are leaving
Emotions flowing through my heart
In the heat I feel so lazy
In the heat we'll all go crazy

It's just, it's just desperation - I'll kill for you
It's just, it's just desperation - I'll kill for you

She might have thorns
She's never worn
Not for me
But when we're close
I just sense the smell of a rose
It might be wrong
It might be right
But I give up without a fight
'Cause I have been waiting - waiting for her

When she comes I hear her say
Hold me close (tonight) - we'll drift away (we'll drift away)
All right - nothing's gonna change it nothing's gonna change it
Now
She's so fine
She'll be mine
Forever and ever
All right - no one's gonna break it no one's gonna shake it now
She's so fine
She'll be mine
All right - nothing's gonna change it nothing's gonna change it
Now
She's so fine
She'll be mine
All right
