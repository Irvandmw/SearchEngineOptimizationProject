Lyrics:


Our past ain't the picture you painted
When you came in here shooting at me
You're like a summer day I'd long forgotten
Your winds, they changed my sanity

Oh now I cry for help
But your smile feels so critical
And I lie to myself just to lay with the centerfold
And waking up drunk in your rays

So wreck me one more night
Like when we would make up
Wreck me one more time
Like I ain't had enough
Wreck me like a ship throw my heart overboard
I can make peace with the sea
If you wreck me
If you wreck me

My heart ain't the beast that it once was
Cuz you can dig out the pieces I saved
Just give me enough to get high on
And let me remember the taste

Yeah now I cry for help
But your smile feels so critical
I'm fighting like hell just to lay with the centerfold
So show me the way to my grave

And wreck me one more night
Like when we would make up
Wreck me one more time
Like I ain't had enough
Wreck me like a ship throw my heart overboard
I can make peace with the sea
If you wreck me
Baby if you wreck me

Wreck me one more night
Wreck me one last time
Wreck me like a ship
Baby wreck me

Wreck me one more night
Wreck me one last time
Wreck me like a ship
Baby wreck me

Show me the way to my grave

And wreck me one more night
Like when we would make up
Wreck me one more time
Like I ain't had enough
Wreck me like a ship throw my heart overboard
I can make peace with the sea
If you wreck me
