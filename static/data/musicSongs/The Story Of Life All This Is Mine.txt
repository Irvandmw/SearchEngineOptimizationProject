Song Name: The Story Of Life (All This Is Mine)
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


All this is mine the blue of the sky
The feel of the soil the sun flaming high
The sight of a bird on the wing
The story of life is a glorious thing

All this is mine the green of the corn
The deep of the night the sleepy faced dawn
The cold of the fall or the spring
The story of life is a glorious thing

Wonderful wonderful wonders from heaven above
Miracle of miracles what is there greater than love
All this is your and mine to behold
The hopes and the dreams each day may enfold
What magic each moment can bring
The story of life is a glorious thing

(Wonderful wonderful) Wonders from heaven above
(Miracle of miracles) What is there greater than love
All this is your and mine to behold
The hopes and the dreams each day may enfold
What magic each moment can bring
The story of life is a glorious thing
