Lyrics:


Uh, yeah, ow!
Do, do, do-do-do
Do, do, do-do-do
Do, do, do-do-do
Do, do, do-do-do

Ever since the day we met
Feel like a baby on Christmas day
Happy is all I get
Whenever you come my way
The sky's another shade of blue
Whenever you go outside
I bet it never rains on you
You're beauty personified

I never been sweet on candy
But you're as sweet as they come
Money never comes in handy
'Cause I can never buy half the fun I get
When I'm with you baby
You're all I want
You're all I want

Ever since the day I kissed you
It's always been on my mind
Honey I can't resist you
I want you all the time
At night I get those dreams
The kind you don't talk about
Just makes me wanna scream
Girl I wanna love you inside out

I never been sweet on candy
But you're as sweet as they come
Money never comes in handy
'Cause I can never buy half the fun I get
When I'm with you baby
You're all I want
You're all I want
Work out!

Do, do, do-do-do
Do, do, do-do-do
Do, do, do-do-do
Do, do, do-do-do

Yeah, I like the way you walk, baby
But in a nutshell, listen

Ain't no kinda maybe
Baby you're the one for me
Your body just drives me crazy
Crazier than anyone should be
You got to be my lover
Talking about the...good thing
Can't wait any longer
I want it so bad I got to sing

I never been sweet on candy (girl you're so sweet)
But you're as sweet as they come
Money never comes in handy
'Cause I can never buy half the fun I get
When I'm with you, baby
You're all I want

Everybody, work out

Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do
You're all I want
You're all I want
You're all I want
You're all I, you're all I, work out!
