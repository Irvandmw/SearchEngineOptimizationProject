Lyrics:


My old flame
I can't even think of her name
But it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again
To my old flame

My old flame
My new lovers all seem so tame
'Cause I haven't met a girl
So magnificent or elegant
As my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who took me up to the sky's
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of

My old flame
I can't even think of her name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame

My old flame
I can't even think of her name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame
My old flame
