Lyrics:


'Twas just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of color - 'neath skies of gray

The raindrops kissed the flower beds
The blossoms raised their thirsty heads
A perfumed thank you they seemed to say

Surely here I was charmed beyond compare - to view
Maybe it was just that I was there - with you

'Twas just a garden in the rain
But then the sun came out again
And sent us happily on our way
