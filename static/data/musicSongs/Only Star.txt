Come with me to the disco
Hey, I've seen everybody show in time, ooh yeah
And I've been over here, the only who've been around, ooh, ah ah
Well, I'm tired at looking at everybody's show
I think it's time that I get out on the floor, cause tonight (tonight)
Tonight, oh, tonight (tonight)
Tonight (ooh)
I'm gonna be the only star tonight at the disco, ooh yeah
I'm gonna be the only star tonight at the disco, ooh yeah

Come with me to the disco
Maybe wait for the late cause here I come, ooh yeah
Me and my partner gonna do it up right tonight and think so
I got me a dress with a precious mine hot
And let me hear you cheers way down that cause tonight (tonight)
Tonight, oh, tonight (tonight)
Tonight, yeah (ooh)
I'm gonna be the only star tonight at the disco, ooh yeah
I'm gonna be the only star tonight at the disco, ooh yeah

Ah ah, ah ah ah, ah (shake it out)
