Lyrics:


Headed down the road again
With a heavy heart fightin' my soul
No cure about where I've been
That's a story two lives ago

Yeah, I've had my riches
And I've dug up ditches
I've been loved a time or two
But nothin' compares
To the good, old-fashioned
Heartache she put me through

Yeah, and ooh, my darlin'
Part of me wants to let go
And you, so charmin'
A part of me is still holdin' on
And I can kiss you when you crawl back
Love you if you want that
All that, we've nothin' to lose, yeah
'Cause nothin' compares
To the good, old-fashioned
Heartache she put me through

I pass by a friendly ghost
'Cause drinkin' drug me back into town
And them long legs and that beautiful smile
Still totin' your baggage around

Yeah, I've been up to Portland
Tried sellin' my organs
But my baby kept a few
'Cause nothin' compares
To the good, old-fashioned
Heartache she put me through

Yeah, ooh, my darlin'
Part of me wants to let go
Oh and you, so charmin'
A part of me is still holdin' on
And I can kiss you when you crawl back
Love you if you want that
All that, we've nothin' to lose, yeah
'Cause nothin' compares
To the good, old-fashioned
Heartache she put me through, whoa

Yeah, I've been up to Portland
Tried sellin' my organs
But my baby kept a few
'Cause nothin' compares
To the good, old-fashioned
Heartache she put me through
