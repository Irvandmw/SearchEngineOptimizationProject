Lyrics:


We back in our zone baby
What it is baby?
Iâma do some thangs, then you gonna do some thangs
Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
And I love it when you give me some
Letâs switch and let me do you instead
Through I love the way you give it to me, girl
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
Bouncing like the springs of the bed
You gonna love it when I give you some
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you give it to me, give it to me, Boing
Get you there and then you go down and up
I know that its a little much but girl Iâm so tempted to touch, Boing
Itâs heating up, 90 degrees Iâll beat it up
Oscar De La Hoya baby spanish flying in your love, Boing
Bouncing off of my pogo stick your cotton candy gummy bears
I canât get enough of it, Boing
Your chocolate covered hershey kiss come and blow my candle out
I promise you can make a wish

Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
And I love it when you give me some
Letâs switch and let me do you instead
Through I love the way you give it to me, girl
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
Bouncing like the springs of the bed
You gonna love it when I give you some
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you do it to me, give it to me, Boing
When youâre down, one two three I won that round
bedroom bully you should know me baby girl a lot of sounds, Boing
Harder the sound that you make, take a second, catch your breath
Iâm on the way, Boing
Cause girl I got that magic potion
Rowing back and forth, yeah thats the motion in the ocean, Boing
And I take you away, more than once in a day
Cause baby girl I catch ya, yeah, yeah
Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
And I love it when you give me some
Letâs switch and let me do you instead
Through I love the way you give it to me, girl
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
Bouncing like the springs of the bed
You gonna love it when I give you some
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you do it to me, give it to me, Boing
Do it to me Iâll return the favor, baby we can do it now or later
Itâs up to you, tell me what you wanna do
Just space and opportunity in between us
You ainât expect me to make that thang bounce
You ainât expect me to take that thang down
You ainât expect to bounce like the springs in the bed
So let me give it to you till youâre shaking your legs
Yeah, we be bouncing like the springs on the bed
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
And I love it when you give me some
Letâs switch and let me do you instead
Through I love the way you give it to me, girl
We be bouncing like the springs of the bed
Bouncing like the springs of the bed
You gonna love it when I give you some
Switch and let you do me instead
Cause I love when you do it to me, give it to me, Boing.
