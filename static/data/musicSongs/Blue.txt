Lyrics:


Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
But when I look into your eyes
I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you're holding me tight
I feel alive

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
Cause when you open your eyes
I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
And when I'm holding you tight
I'm so alive
So now let's just live it up

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

We've gotta hold on
I've gotta hold on
You've got to hold on
You've got a hold on, a hold onto me
We've gotta hold on
I've gotta hold on
You've got a hold on
You've got a hold on, a hold onto me

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, blue

[Outro â Blue Ivy:]
Hold on to me, hold on
Bee-sy-ay, bee-sy-ay, bee-sy-ay
Mommy mommy mommy!
Can we see daddy?
Can we see daddy?
Miss you daddy...
