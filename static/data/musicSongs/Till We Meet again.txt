Lyrics:


I want to share the love that fills my being
If your willing
Come along
Take of me this evening and this love
If you're lonely
Come let's be
There's no time for shyness
How fast night turns to day
Let's just light love's fire
And lay embraced till it burns away
Kiss goodbye and journey on to new loves
Keep your own love
Till we meet again
