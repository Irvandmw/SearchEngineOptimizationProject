Mmm
Mhm, Ugh
Yeah

Is it borin'? Baby glowin'
You might be hoe-ing, 'cause she be going
She be lonely, get to know me
Rain is pourin', hold on with the hold thing
Clyde and Bonnie, threw it back on you
My bitch she be with me she not slidin' for you
Ridin' 'round the city, got my girl with me
Seein' you so pretty, diamonds lookin' clean, oh
Oh, baby do it, baby move it
Baby do it, baby move it
Shawty you a 10, still my best friend
Slidin' in a benz, shawty had to buy me a new benz

Baby, yeah do it, baby move it
Baby do it, baby move it
Move it, baby do it
Shawty you a 10
Baby, yeah do it, baby move it
Baby do it, baby move it
Move it, baby do it
Shawty you a 10

Too much bands, I would say we checkin' in
So I pop out, It ain't nothin' to me
Loyalty you got, and its all to me
That my lil baby, and she runnin' from me
I go so fast, I go so fast
Big fat wood I dont pass, that bitch big ass
Bands all on me
Come to my crib, smoke some big gasoline

Baby, yeah do it, baby move it
Baby do it, baby move it
Move it, baby do it
Shawty you a 10
Baby, yeah do it, baby move it
Baby do it, baby move it
Move it, baby do it
Shawty you a 10

Ugh
Ugh
Ugh
