Lyrics:


To really love a woman
To understand her
You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought
See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

When you love a woman you tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody to tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever reallyâreally-really ever loved a woman?

To really love a woman
Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her
Really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood

And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

When you love a woman you tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody to tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever reallyâreally-really ever loved a woman?

You've got to give her some faith
Hold her tight
A little tenderness
You gotta treat her right
She will be there for you takin' good care of you
You really gotta love your woman

And when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

When you love a woman you tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody to tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever reallyâreally-really ever loved a woman?

Just tell me have you ever reallyâreally-really ever loved a woman?
Just tell me have you ever reallyâreally-really ever loved a woman?
