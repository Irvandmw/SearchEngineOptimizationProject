Lyrics:


[Verse]
Sending out a mayday
Weâre going down
Nothing we could have done
Would have turned it round
Everything we had scattered everywhere
Searching through the wreckage of a love affair

[Bridge]
You got something to say?
Say it to me
Not everyone else
You say that Iâm to blame
My words are in vain
Donât go fooling yourself

[Chorus]
Thereâs a little black box yea
Somewhere in the ocean
Holding all the truth about us
Thereâs a little black box
A record of emotion
Everything that ever was
You may deny it
But when I find it
Iâm gonna play it aloud to the world
Little black box yea
In a little black box yea

[Verse]
Thereâs a lot of pressure when you get deep
You left me on my own at six hundred feet
I was looking round for a little help
But everyone was looking out for themselves

[Bridge]
You got something to say?
Say it to me
Not everyone else
You say that Iâm to blame
My words are in vain
Donât go fooling yourself

[Chorus]
Thereâs a little black box yea
Somewhere in the ocean
Holding all the truth about us
Thereâs a little black box
A record of emotion
Everything that ever was
You may deny it
But when I find it
Iâm gonna play it aloud to the world
Little black box yea
In a little black box yea

[Verse]
You canât stop a true survivor
Youâll discover that on your own
Cause Iâm a true survivor
And Iâll be here after youâve gone
Long after youâve gone
Long after youâve gone

[Chorus]
Thereâs a little black box yea
Somewhere in the ocean
Holding all the truth about us
Thereâs a little black box
A record of emotion
Everything that ever was
You may deny it
But when I find it
Iâm gonna play it aloud to the world
Little black box yea
In a little black box yea

Little black box
Little black box
Little black box
