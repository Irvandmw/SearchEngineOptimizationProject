Lyrics:


Bali Ha'i may call you any night, any day
In your heart you'll hear it call you, "Come away, come away"
Bali Ha'i will whisper on the wind of the sea
"Here am I, your special island, come to me, come to me"

Your own special hopes
Your own special dreams
Bloom on the hillside
And shine in the streams

If you try, you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
Here am I, your special island
Come to me, come to me

Someday you'll see me
Floating in the sunshine
My head sticking out from a low flying cloud
You'll hear me call you
Singing through the sunshine
Sweet and clear as can be

Bali Ha'i will whisper, "Here am I, come to me"
