[Future:]
Yeah I wanna just go to the club and vibe with you
Know what sayin'?
Woah she bad
She's a bad one

I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
Give me three percs and some codeine
I swear to you, I'm a get deep in that pussy
We toast it up, let the bar come to us
I'm a get deep in that pussy
You know what come with the fame
You know what come with these dames
You know what come with my name
You ask for everything
You ask for everything, I give you everything
Without these bright lights, we gon' shine for the both of us

Pourin' out, pourin' up
Keep that lean off in my cup, what's up, huh
Pourin' out, pourin' up
Keep that lean off in my cup, what's up, huh

I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
Give me three percs and some codeine
I swear to you, I'm a get deep in that pussy
We toast it up, let the bar come to us
I'm a get deep in that pussy

[Louie:]
I'm a get deep in that pussy
And I'm a just fuck with my jeweler
I'm a just dive like a scuba
She get every inch of my ruler
She call me a king like a ruler
Then she give me the head like Medusa
She squirt on my sheets
And then there she just bust like my shooters
She wanna fuck every way
And I'm a give everything (uh-huh)
You poppin' that purple
You sippin' on purple rain
And I'm a keep it real with you
I'm 'bout to get deep in that pussy
You callin' my name
You will not fuck with the same
Got you here bustin' the tool
Remember when I fucked you in the coupe?
Got you here starin' at the stars with no roof
Fuck her, fuck her like a cougar (cougar)
That pussy pussy like a Rubix
Fuck in the Jordans then I put on Pumas
Got you just sippin', sippin' on Actavis
Got you prayin', prayin' like a Catholic
Give me that pretty pussy, I'm a kill it
Fuck you reveal it, now you catchin' feelins
Fuck you reveal it, now you catchin' feelins
I'm a get deep in that pussy

[Future:]
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
Give me three percs and some codeine
I swear to you, I'm a get deep in that pussy
We toast it up, let the bar come to us
I'm a get deep in that pussy

Pourin' out, pourin' up
Keep that lean off in my cup, what's up, huh
Pourin' out, pourin' up
Keep that lean off in my cup, what's up, huh

[YCiti:]
That pussy is callin' my name
I act a dog off the chain
Hit every wall in that thing
She be bustin' back to back to back to back to back
Then dip like it's a drive-by
Pull up, beat that pussy, slide out
She be yellin', screamin', "Time out"
Bet her man don't ever find out
I'm a cuff her, let her bind out
It ain't no keepin' that pussy
I'm a go deep in that pussy
Mixin' codeine with like three different weeds
I hope I don't fall asleep
I got this money on me
I got this.40 on me
I've been up for 'bout a week
Trappin', I've been tryna make it happen
Look at me now, I done made it happen
And these diamonds shine for the both of us
We gon' kill 'em, girl you know what's up
All this drank, we gon' pour it up
All this loud, might as well smoke it up
Then fuck

[Future:]
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
I'm a get deep in that pussy
Give me three percs and some codeine
I swear to you, I'm a get deep in that pussy
We toast it up, let the bar come to us
I'm a get deep in that pussy

Pourin' out, pourin' up
Keep that lean off in my cup, what's up, huh
Pourin' out, pourin' up
Keep that lean off in my cup, what's up, huh
