Lyrics:


Girl, you said you love me loud
I'm listening, make me proud
Girl, make me bow
I want to feel all your love in my chest
Bang it out
So turn it up, shake the ground
'Til I can't walk, lock me down, knock me down
Your frequency screams at me
Wanna know how you soundin' surround

Break this heat up
Girl, you know how much I need ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wanna feel the walls just closin' in
Wanna feel the fire on the floor
Rattle my head and spin my world around

Turn it up, love me louder
Make me feel your heartbeat through the floor
Sound your alarm, sound your alarm
I need ya
Sound your alarm, sound your alarm
I need to hear it, scream it
Make me feel you crashing through my core
(Ah) sound your alarm (Ah), sound your alarm
I need ya
Sound your alarm, sound your alarm louder

Make my chest feel paper-thin, baby, let me in
Ricochet, let that ricochet right, right, h-hit me
Make my day, ain't time for delay
Girl, you hit me now, now, now, now

Break this heat up
Girl, you know how much I need ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wanna feel the walls just closin' in
Wanna feel the fire on the floor
Rattle my head and spin my world around

Turn it up, love me louder
Make me feel your heartbeat through the floor
Sound your alarm, sound your alarm
I need ya
Sound your alarm, sound your alarm
I need to hear it, scream it
Make me feel you crashing through my core
(Ah) sound your alarm (Ah), sound your alarm
I need ya
Sound your alarm, sound your alarm louder

Say my name, say my name
(You better scream my name)
Yeah, make me scream out
Shake it up, shake it up
I need to hear it now (Oh whoa)
Say my name, say my name (Yeah)
Yeah, baby, wear it out
Oh, oh
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
Now baby, scream out
Shake it up, shake it up
Just to tear it down
Feel me up, feel me up
Don't let me bow down, down, down
Love me loud (Yeah!)

Turn it up (Whoa), love me louder
Make me feel your heartbeat through the floor
Sound your alarm (Sound your alarm), sound your alarm
I need ya
Sound your alarm, sound your alarm (Sound)
I need to hear it (Yeah), scream it (Yeah)
Make me feel you crashing through my core
(Ah) sound your alarm (Ah), sound your alarm
I need ya
Sound your alarm, sound your alarm louder

You should do
