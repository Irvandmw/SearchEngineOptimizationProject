Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Way back yonder in the days of old,
The men was working but not saving any dough.
Then came a woman looking real cool.
She said to herself, "Now that's my fool."

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna ball tonight.
I'm gonna ball tonight.
Well, I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool.

Met a girl on the avenue,
She was shy and I was blue,
Like a teacher and a student in school,
Looked at me and said, "You're my fool."

[Chorus]

[Repeat First Verse]

[Chorus]

We're gonna ball tonight.
We're gonna ball tonight.
We're gonna ball tonight.
We're gonna ball tonight.
Well I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool.
