Lyrics:


Walking along beneath the lights of that miracle mile,
Me and Mary making our way into the night.
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides,
The pinball bells, and the skee ball slides,
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight.

There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the street.
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hand.
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet.

And in the morning I'm leaving
Making my way back to Cleveland.
So, tonight I hope that I will do just fine.
And I don't see
How you could ever be
Anything but mine.

There's a local band playing at the sea-side pavilion,
And I got just enough cash to get us in.
And as we are dancing, Mary's wrapping her arms around me,
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin.

In the midst of the music I tell her I love her,
We both laugh 'cause we know it isn't true.
Ah, but, Mary, there's a summer drawing to an end tonight,
And there's so much that I long to do to you.

But in the morning I'm leaving
Making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see
How you could ever be
Anything but mine.

And in the morning I'm leaving
Making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see
How you could ever be
Anything but mine.

Mary, I don't see
How you could ever be
Anything but mine.

And in the morning I'm leaving
Making my way back to Cleveland.
So, tonight I hope that I will do just fine.
Hey, I don't see
How you could ever be
Anything but mine.
