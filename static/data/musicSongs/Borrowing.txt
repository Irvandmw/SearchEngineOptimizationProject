Lyrics:


You're probably sitting at a bar
Fingers loosely cradling a glass
I'm miles from where you are
I can't remember when I saw you last

We both have so-called responsibilities
And others to answer to tomorrow
But, right now, I'm begging you to be my safety
The kind of love I can't return
But I'm going to borrow

Your eyes meet mine
The lights are playing shadows right down to your collar
Your love is calling
I'm praying you'll do anything to stall her

I'm sorry, darling
I know he's yours
I know you make him breakfast
And fit between his arms

Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing a broken love

I'm sorry, darling
I know he's yours
I know you wear his class ring
And I don't mean you any harm

Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing a broken love

Your laughing offers some honest conversation
Catch me in the cracks between your crooked smile
Your words are more like illustrations
Toss your head back
But I know you'll stay awhile

Your eyes meet mine
The lights are playing shadows right down to your collar

Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing a broken love

Your love is calling
I'm praying you'll do anything to stall her

Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing a broken love

Tell me, how can a heavy heart be so empty?
You left all your baggage on my step
When you went and left me

I'm sorry, darling
I know he's yours
I know you make him breakfast
And fit between his arms

Tonight I'm borrowing my perfect man
I'm borrowing your broken love

I'm sorry, darling
I know he's yours
I know you keep him close
And I don't mean you any harm

Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing a broken love
