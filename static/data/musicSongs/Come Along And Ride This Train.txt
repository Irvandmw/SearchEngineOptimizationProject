Lyrics:


I know a land where mountain streams are running free
I know a prairie where thereâs miles between each tree
I know where thereâs people you would like to get to know
Come along with me and go

Come along and ride this train
Come along and ride this train
Cross the mountains prairies reservations
Rivers levees plains
Come along and ride this train

I heard a story that Iâd like to share with you
And I know a valley that Iâd like to take you through
I will show you things that I am sure youâd like to see
Come along and go with me

Come along and ride this train
Come along and ride this train
Cross the mountains prairies reservations
Rivers levees plains
Come along and ride this train

I know a land where mountain streams are running free
I know a prairie where thereâs miles between each tree
I know where thereâs people you would like to get to know
Come along with me and go

Come along and ride this train
Come along and ride this train
Cross the mountains prairies reservations
Rivers levees plains
Come along and ride this train

I heard a story that Iâd like to share with you
And I know a valley that Iâd like to take you through
I will show you things that I am sure youâd like to see
Come along and go with me

Come along and ride this train
Come along and ride this train
Cross the mountains prairies reservations
Rivers levees plains
Come along and ride this train
