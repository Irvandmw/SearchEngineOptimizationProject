Lyrics:


[Verse 1:]
Uh, feeling like I gotta get it right now
Moving like a killer in the darkness outta sight now
On another level, so the devil wanna fight now
Growing up dirt broke, but it's looking bright now
Bitches on the pipe now, lick a dick right now
But I can't fade, taking shots with the sight down
Uh, yeah I coulda died that day
But I guess God don't ride that way
Chillin' in the club, getting high all day
With a couple bad bitches, I'm a do it my way
Trippin' by the way that I be livin'
Everything I got 'em giving
Why you think they can't do it like me

[Hook:]
I'm a get high yeah, yeah, yeah [x4]

[Verse 2:]
No, I don't smoke, but I'm feeling like
Maybe getting green'll get a brotha' feeling hella right (Uh)
Bitches on my dick, but I don't give a damn (Yeah)
Blowin' up my phone, trynna get the dinner plan
Back stage with the homies 'bout to get it, man
Fuck a fifteen minute man
Look young, but I been a man
All that ringtone rap, make a brotha' wanna kill a man
I am just a sinner, man
Keep it real, yeah, that been the plan
You know we always do it for the fans
I be sippin' low key like no ID
Always in the lab, yes, sir, that's me
Label that I'm reppin', that's VMG
From the womb to the tomb, we be keepin' it G (Logic)
What you know about me?
Everybody know that I be reppin' that 3-0-1
Fuck around again, son
West Deer Park, that's where I'm from

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Feeling like I gotta bring it back again
Always on another level, don't know how to act again
I be on that real (real), no I never back down
You don't wanna fuck around
Busting like a Mac, now
Started from the bottom, ain't no way I'm a go back down
Slack now, all the motherfucker, hell naw, never that now
Tell me that they love me, I don't give a fuck
Boy chillin' in the cut bad bitch, far from it, slut

[Hook]
