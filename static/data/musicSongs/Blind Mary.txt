Lyrics:


[Intro: Cee-Lo]
Whoahh-ohhhhhhh
YEAHHHHHHH!
I love, Mary! (I love Mary)
Blind Mary, marry me (marry me)
I love, Mary! (la lah lah)

[Cee-Lo]
She has never seen the sunshine (sunshine)
Yet she's getting along just fine (fine)
She's not staying, she's just passing through (through-ooh-ooeooh-ooh)
Hey, do you mind if I follow you?
Youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I love, Mary! (I love Mary)
Blind Mary, marry me (marry me)
I love, Mary! (la la lah)
Yeaaaahhhhhhhhhh

[Cee-Lo]
I heard a voice say catch me if you can
Before you know it I was holding her hand
It's harder to imagine than understand
How she knows exactly who I am
Yeaaaahhhhhhhhhh

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo]
She's my friend, she doesn't judge me
She has no idea I'm ugly
So I've absolutely nothing to hide
Because I'm so much prettier inside
Yeaaaahhhhhhhhhh

[Chorus]
