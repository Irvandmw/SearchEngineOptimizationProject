Lyrics:


In the field ballin' with the team (With the team)
In the field ballin' with the team
OCD 'cause I'm riding so clean
Old school whip seeing new things
Rollin' up, got a few flamed
New Prada shoes, no shoestrings
Closet full of kicks like Liu Kang
We was just dreamers
Broken leaders, on the low, rolling weed up
Now they see us in that drop top Bimmer
Feel like ODB, feeling OCD

Out this universe DC
Goin' so hard, make it look easy
With the squad, zone 3
We so cold, wrist on freeze
Roll it up, I'ma get high
If you feel me, put your hands to the sky
Break it down, roll it up, I'ma get high
Nothing else matters up until the day I die
Wanna move my loved ones out the Southside
If you look up, you might see us in the sky
If you look up, you might see us in the sky

Time is undefeated, in the end it beats us all
My daddy, my momma, myself, we all destined to fall
Currently, the most important thing within my life is balance
I ain't talking commas and zeroes, or monetary
Talking self worth, put your self first
Don't worry about the worst
But when you in this position
It's hard to make selfish decisions
Got enough bread, I'ma eat but what about the rest, my team
They good and all but I mean, if I disappear from the scene
Then what's gon' happen? What's gon' happen?
In the hotel writin' rhymes before I headline at a festival
But all that's runnin' through my mind is bottom lines and decimals
So focused on the brand, sometimes forget about the man
Reflecting in the mirror with this pen in his hand
Ninety-nine percent of these people will never understand
Supply and demand
'Cause I'm in the public eye
They think they know who I am

In the field ballin' with the team (With the team)
In the field ballin' with the team
OCD 'cause I'm riding so clean
Old school whip seeing new things
Rollin' up, got a few flamed
New Prada shoes, no shoestrings
Closet full of kicks like Liu Kang
We was just dreamers
Broken leaders, on the low rolling weed up
Now they see us in that drop top Bimmer
Feel like ODB, feeling OCD

Oh shit, it's Logic can I have a picture?
They don't give a damn
Soon as they see me, they clench the device that's in they hand
Don't even say hello, more like can I get one for the 'Gram
That's when I be like, "Fuck no, but you can shake my hand
Let's have a conversation, talk about life man to man
You disappointed, I can read your body language like a paragraph"
"Logic, yeah that's cool and all but I much prefer a photograph
I mean, can I have a photograph?"
Goddamn all these people now a days is so unusual
They rather snap a pick with you to get more likes than usual
Than have a conversation back in the basement with no placement
Couldn't never fathom talkin' to my favorite rapper that way
I'm just an entity, my DNA not my identity, finding serenity
Become a better man, I better be
For the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy
We get big bread tryna be the greatest, that shit been dead
I'm tryna be the happiest that I could be instead
I'm tryna get ahead like a fetus, money don't complete us
But defeat us, it could lead us to depression
Being rich is not a blessin'
Fame is not a blessin'
Wasn't till I was rich and famous I learned that lesson
What's the meaning of life? To live it what I'm guessing, yeah

In the field ballin' with the team (With the team)
In the field ballin' with the team
Oh, she thick 'cause I'm ridin' so clean
Old school whip seein' new things
Rollin' up, gotta few flamed
New prada shoes, no shoe strings
Closet full of kicks like Liu Kang
We were just dreamers
Broken leaders, on the low, rolling weed up
Now, they see us in the drop top Bimmer
Feel like OBD, feelin' OCD

Social media may cause depression
