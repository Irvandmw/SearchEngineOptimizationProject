Lyrics:


Madeleine
What's up with those tears in your eyes
What happened when you shut down,
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

[Chorus:]
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise and live again
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine

Remember when we used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And youâd put it in a movie, maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

Hold on, donât let go
Hold on and youâll know
Help is on its way

[Chorus]

Let the sunshine warm your heart today
So rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine

[Chorus]

Oh Madeleine
Oh Madeleine
