Lyrics:


Well, oh yeah
Oh baby, oh, oh baby
Yeah, make it pretty for me now
Do that for me

Half a love just won't do
Just ain't good enough, no, oh oh oh oh
Half a love it will not do (just won't do)
It just ain't good enough, no, it ain't baby

Don't turn me on just to turn me off
We got to work this sound together
No build me up just to bring me down, hey
Tell me you're not that kind of fellow

Because half a love it won't do (just won't do)
It just ain't good enough, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no
Half a love it just won't do (just won't do)
Just ain't good enough, no, no no

Don't squeeze me baby if you can't hold on
Oh yeah, I want a love that's true man
Now don't you make me weak when I feel so strong, yeah
Now that I got love all mine

There's why to start if we can't go all the way
Don't play with fire if you're afraid to get burn
Don't go to teach you if you're not willing to let
I want you to stop, look, listen to me
Hear my plea, yeah, hear my plea

Because half a love just won't do (just won't do)
It ain't good enough, not for me, no no no no no no no no no
Half a love it just won't do (just won't do)
It just ain't good enough

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Won't do, won't do, won't do, won't do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Won't do, won't do, won't do, won't do
