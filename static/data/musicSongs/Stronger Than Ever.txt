Lyrics:


What you gave me, I know you gave me
You remind me all the time
And how you hurt me and you donât see it
Again, I am the child
And though you tell me that you love me
I canât feel it and Iâm afraid to let you down
Itâs all or nothing, I fear that somethingâs wrong

Iâm tired of walking on eggshells, so terrified to fail
And in order to please you Iâve abandoned myself
And though it used to hurt me when you pushed me away
Iâm stronger than ever, you made me this way

How I wish you, you suffered less too
It tears us both apart
And itâs not pretty, the way you criticize me
And how it breaks my heart

And though you tell me that you love me
I canât feel it and Iâm afraid to let you down
Itâs all or nothing, I fear that somethingâs wrong

Iâm tired of walking on eggshells, so terrified to fail
And in order to please you Iâve abandoned myself
And though it used to hurt me when you pushed me away
Iâm stronger than ever, you made me this way

How I wish you knew, how much I need you
I feel like running but I canât abandon you
You avoid my gaze, withdraw from me these days
You punish me for trying to be all that you wanted
What more can I do?

Iâm tired of walking on eggshells, so terrified to fail
And in order to please you Iâve abandoned myself
And though it used to hurt me when you pushed me away
Iâm stronger than ever, you made me this way

Iâm tired of walking on eggshells, so terrified to fail
And in order to please you Iâve abandoned myself
And though it used to hurt me when you pushed me away
Iâm stronger than ever, you made me this way
