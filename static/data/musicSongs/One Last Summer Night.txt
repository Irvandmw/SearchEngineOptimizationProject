Lyrics:


In the sky I see the lights from aeroplanes
And I wonder why the good things always have to end
On the beach the moon is watching you and me
And in this magic minute we should make a wish

Can we turn back the time
Before the best is over
For one last summer night
For one last summer night
Can we turn back the time
Before the night is over
For one last summer night
One last summer night

You and I are so in love and dreaming of nothing else
And though the seasons change I just can't move on by myself

Can we turn back the time
Before the best is over
For one last summer night
For one last summer night
Can we turn back the time
Before the night is over
For one last summer night
One last summer night

Before all we have
Are faded photographs
Hold me near and close your eyes

Can we turn back the time
Before the best is over
One last summer night

Can we turn back the time
Before the best is over
For one last summer night
For one last summer night
Can we turn back the time
Before the night is over
For one last summer night
One last summer night
One last summer night
