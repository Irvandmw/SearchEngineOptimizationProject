Lyrics:


Another lonely night, on the telephone we talk
When will the lightening strike, the thundering roar
Pretending that you miss the touch of my caress
But our lips never met, cause one kiss could never last
Locked up inside your room
You play your lover's tunes
You dance all night, but you run out of moves
You're so close but out of reach
Your voice is haunting me

You've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep baby
You're talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep

You play so hard to get
I know you'll never change your ways
You make the minutes seem like hours
The hours seem like days
You know I'll come when you whisper
I'll run when you call
And when I'm calling out to you
Oh baby, I got no replies at all
This hide and seek were playing
Is such a vicious game
But it don't matter what you say
I love you anyway

Cause you've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep baby
You're talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep

You've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep

You've been talking in your sleep again
Talking in your sleep
You've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep baby
Talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep
You've been talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep baby
Talking in your sleep again
You talk in your sleep
