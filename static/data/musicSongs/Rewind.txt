Lyrics:


Picture this one, it's holding back (back) 
I'm just tryin' to remember 
The best night I ever had (had) 
I keep thinkin' all of the 
Touches, kisses, and screams (screams) 
Let me recreate it, 
Oh my God, we did some things (things) 

[Bridge] 
Holding onto you, it's so true 
Don't you, know that I got everything 
If I had to, Redo 
That oooh 
I would've Tivo'd everything 

[Chorus] 
I wish that I could rewind it 
Roll me on the bed 
Ooh touch me right there 
Grab me by my waist 

I wish that I could rewind it 
Lying next to me 
Loving me to sleep 
I can hardly wait 

I wish that I could rewind it 
Reminisce about the things we do (do) 
Ain't nobody that could handle me like you (you) 
Love so good, wish we could've tape that 
So we could replay that 
Wish that I could rewind that 
I wish that I could rewind it 

Just like the first time I saw your face 
I remembered how you were 
When you were in that place 
So all I'm sayin' 
Some memories can't be replaced 
That's why I can't let go of that night 
It's history 

[Bridge] 
I'll hold onto you, it's so true 
Don't you, know that I got everything 
If I had to, Redo 
That oooh 
I would've Tivo'd everything 

[Chorus] 
I wish that I could rewind it 
Roll me on the bed 
Ooh touch me right there 
Grab me by my waist 

I wish that I could rewind it 
Lying next to me 
Loving me to sleep 
I can hardly wait 

I wish that I could rewind it 
Reminisce about the things we do (do do) 
Ain't nobody that could handle me like you (you you) 
Love so good, wish we could've tape that 
So we could replay that 
Wish that I could rewind that 
I wish that I could rewind it 

Don't wanna lose this love 
That won't mislead us apart babe 
Never wanna re-create a baby 
So I'll just play it over and over again in my mind 
I know second time for this 
(I wanna rewind it) 
I just wanna re-live that one night (Rewind it) 
I don't wanna mess up if we try 
So I'm not gonna chance it 
Wanna replay it 
Wanna rewind it 

[Chorus] 
I wish that I could rewind it 
Roll me on the bed (yea..) 
ooh touch me right there (touch me) 
Grab me by my waist 

I wish that I could rewind it 
Lying next to me (ooh) 
Loving me to sleep (ooh) 
I can hardly wait 

I wish that I could rewind it 
Reminisce about the things we do (do..) 
Ain't nobody that could handle me like you 
(Nobody that could handle me like you ) 
Love so good, wish we could've tape that 
So we could replay that 
Wish that I could rewind that 
I wish that I could rewind it 

'Wind it ('wind it) 
Rewind it (Rewind it) 
Rewind it (Rewind it) 

'Wind it ('wind it) 
Rewind it (Rewind it) 
Rewind it (Rewind it) 
Rewind it
