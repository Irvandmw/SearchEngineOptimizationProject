Lyrics:


Miss Maggie was way too young to understand,
Why she got thrown into someone else's hands,
Why she woke up to strange men,
They tore her to pieces
And she couldn't comprehend,
Why she was locked up in a basement
Filled with men,
Should've gone to school,
Instead she did them.

Don't touch me,
I'm fragile,
I'm bitter in my heart.

Mama sold me
For candy,
And I was ruined from the start.

Why do you have to sell me to those mean old men?
They cut me up in places
I don't even understand,
It's normalcy to me, but how will my friends understand?
I'm five years old,
Sleepin' with a million men.

All grown up and her body has decayed,
All those promiscuous games she had to play,
Oh, she skipped the jungle-jungle-gym phase.

She's tryin' to look at things in a bright way,
Sees the light peekin' through the end of the hallway,
No, she's tryin', tryin', tryin' to escape...

I'm runnin'
Full force, dear
But it's harder when you're bones,
I'm weak-kneed
But I'm flyin'
Out of this hell hole.

Why do you have to sell me to those mean old men?
They cut me up in places,
I don't even understand,
It's normalcy to me, but how will my friends understand?
I'm ten years old,
Runnin' from a million men.
A million men.

Finally the light is comin' close,
No turning back,
Run full force,
Angels swoop down and grab me,
And now I'm safe away,
From the million men who raised me.

Why do you have to sell me to those mean old men?
They cut me up in places,
I don't even understand,
It's normalcy to me,
How will my boyfriend understand?
I'm seventeen
With a history
Of a million men.
Men.
A million men.

A million men,
A million men,
A million,
A million men.

A million men,
A million men,
A million,
A million men.

A million men...
