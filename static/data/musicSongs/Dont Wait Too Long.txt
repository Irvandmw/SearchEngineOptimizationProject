Lyrics:


You are the summer and I am the autumn
Don't wait too long
Your song's beginning while mine has been sung
Don't wait too long

Fall is a lovely time of the year
When the leaves turn to gold and brown
But soon fall is ending and winter is near
And the leaves start tumblin' down

Why must the moments go by in such haste?
Don't wait too long
Winter is coming, we've no time to waste
Don't wait too long

And while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me, don't wait too long

So while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me, don't wait too long
