Lyrics:


The autumn leaves are falling,
Like tears from her eyes,
There's no reason recalling,
The pain you felt inside, 
And I know you're feeling like, 
You should run away, run away,
And I know you're wondering, 
Oh why you should stay,
Why you should stay

Oh Sweet, sweet Isabel,
Just believe it will be alright,
Sweet, sweet Isabel,
No, you don't have to leave tonight

You feel that change is coming,
But you're so afraid inside,
I know your hearts been broken,
Oh way too many times, 
And i know you're feeling like,
You should run away, run away

Oh Sweet, sweet Isabel,
Just believe it will be alright,
Sweet, sweet Isabel,
No, you don't have to leave tonight,
You don't have to leave tonight,
No, you don't have to leave tonight,
No, you don't have to leave tonight,
No, you don't have to leave tonight,
Nooo, no you don't 

Oh Sweet, sweet Isabel,
Just believe it will be alright,
Sweet, sweet Isabel,
No, you don't have to leave tonight

The autumn leaves are falling,
Like tears from her eyes,
There's no reason recalling,
The pain you felt inside.
