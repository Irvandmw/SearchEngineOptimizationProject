Lyrics:


Yeah B, talk your shit
(partner let me upgrade you)
How you're gon' upgrade me
What's higher than number one
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block
(partner let me upgrade you)

I hear you be the block
But I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Noticed you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing
Believe me, believe me

Come harder this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself trust me you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for

You need a real woman in your life
That's a good look
Taking care, home is still fly
That's a good look
And I'mma help you build up your account
That's a good look
Better yet a hood look,
Believe me
Ladies that's a good look

When you're in them big meetings for the mills
That's a good look
You take me just to complement the deal
That's a good look
And anything you cop I'll split the bill
That's a good look
Better yet a hood look
Believe me
Ladies that's a good look

Partner let me upgrade you
Audemars-Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you
I can (up),
Can I (up)
Let me upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you

Partner let me upgrade you
Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things
And upgrade you
I can (up),
Can I (up),
Let me upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you

I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still play my part and let you take the lead role
Believe me

I'll follow this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me
I see your hustle with my hustle I can keep you
Focused on your focus I can feed you

You need a real woman in your life
That's a good look
Taking care home is still fly
That's a good look
I can help you build up your account
That's a good look
Better yet a hood look
Believe me
Ladies that's a good look

When you're in the big meetings for the mills
That's a good look
You take me just to complement the deal
That's a good look
Anything you cop I'll split the bill
That's a good look
Better yet a hood look
Believe me
Ladies that's a good look
I can upgrade you

Partner let me upgrade you
Audemars-Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Have you rocking purple labels
Upgrade you
I can (up),
Can I (up)
Let me upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you

Partner let me upgrade you
Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things
And upgrade you
I can (up),
Can I (up),
Let me upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you

[Jay-Z:]
I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the Jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling baby when I'm courting you

I'm talking spy bags
And fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg and rumors
You on the verge
Of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger is like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse

It's humorous to me they watching
And we just yachting island hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, oh baby you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars.
This is high level not eye level,
My bezel courtesy of Audemars

I order yours tomorrow now
Look at the time I saved you
Mama let me upgrade you

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets

But it's that little glimpse of light
That makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
But unless your flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

Partner let me upgrade you
Audemars-Piguet you
You switch your neckties to purple labels
Upgrade you
I can up
Can I up
Let me upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you

Partner let me upgrade you
Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things
And upgrade you
I can up
Can I up?
Let me upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you

Audemars Piguet watch
Dimples in your necktie
Hermes briefcase
Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers
Diamond-creamed facials
VVS cuff links
Six-star pent suites

Partner let me upgrade you grade you
Partner partner let me upgrade you grade you
Let me let me let me upgrade you grade you
Partner partner partner let me upgrade you
