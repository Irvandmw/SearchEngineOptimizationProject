Lyrics:


I was so insatiable
Till the lights came on
And the stories got old
Now there's no one here I know
And the city outside's
Not the same anymore

And I
I remember when we were young
We'd write our names in the sand, so carelessly
Then the rain came and yours was gone
And now mine, it stands alone

Nobody sees me
Now, I'm a one man show
I'll do this on my own
We knew it all then
Now, this is all I know
Guess I'm heading home now

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yes, I'm heading home now
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yes, I'm heading home now

And the music always played
With the sound of our lives
And the sweetest escape
And the neighbors would complain
We would turn it up louder
Who cares anyway?

'Cause we
We remember that we were young
Our lives were grains in the sand
That we made our castles and kingdoms of
Now the waves have torn them down

Nobody sees me
Now, I'm a one man show

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yes, I'm heading home now
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yes, I'm heading home now

You'll find me
I'll be here, oh
I can't see
I can't breathe anymore

But how could we have stayed?
You were high on love
I was drunk
Drunk on the pain

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (yes, I'm heading)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (I'm heading, I'm heading)
I'm heading home
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (mmh-hm)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yes, I'm heading home now
