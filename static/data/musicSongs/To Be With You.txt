Lyrics:


Hold on little girl
Show me what he's done to you
Stand up little girl
A broken heart can't be that bad
When it's through, it's through 
Fate will twist the both of you 
So come on baby, come on over 
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too (Feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (I've waited on a line)
Just to be the next to be with you

Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up, who cares about 
Little boys that talk too much
Well I seen it all go down 
Your game of love was all rained out
So come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to hold you

I'm the one who wants to be with you (Yes, I'm the one)
Deep inside I hope you feel it too (That you feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (Yeah, waited on a line)
Just to be the next to be with you

Why be alone when we can be together baby?
You can make my life worthwhile
And I can make you start to smile

When it's through, it's through 
Fate will twist the both of you 
So come on baby, come on over 
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too (I hope that you feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one, the one)
Deep inside I hope you feel it too (You feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (Waited on a line)
Just to be the next to be with you
Yeah, just to be the next to be with you
