Lyrics:


I remember yesterday
Like it wasnât far away
And you were by my side

Now itâs all a bitter haze
I donât recognize my face
And Iâm not thinkinâ right
I canât help myself

With you gone, I am nothing without you
Just a ghost chasing your memory
Shaking, fadingâ¦.a shadow where I used to be
Baby, look what youâve done to me

Well, you broke my heart to death
And now the only thing thatâs left
Are my emotional remains

I wish the silence would shut up
Cause Iâve really had quite enough
This slow burning pain
I canât even cry for help

With you gone, I am nothing without you
Just a ghost chasing your memory
Shaking, fadingâ¦.a shadow where I used to be
Baby, look what youâve done to me

How dare you make me love you
How dare you make me love you

With you gone, I am nothing without you
Just a ghost chasing your memory
Shaking, fadingâ¦.a shadow where I used to be
Baby, look what youâve done to me
