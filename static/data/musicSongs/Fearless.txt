Lyrics:


It's 3 AM, and I'm lying here next to you
What you gonna do?
Will you tell a story,
When he asks you where the hell
You've been
Or will you tell the truth?

Well, I ain't holdin' back 
I know where I stand
I just wanna be with you
You gotta face the fact 
Baby, I'm your man
I've gotta get it through to you
Yeah, I'm fearless

You don't have to hide 
You don't have to share half your life
With some other guy
Baby, we're so strong 
And it's been going on so long
It's time to make it right 
Want you to spend the night

But I ain't holding back 
I know where I stand
I just wanna be with you
You gotta face the fact 
Baby, I'm your man
I've gotta get it through to you
And I'm fearless
Yeah, I'm fearless

I just wannaâ
I just wanna be with you

I ain't holding back 
I know where I stand
I just wanna be with you
Gotta face the fact 
Baby, I'm your man
I've gotta get it through to you
Yeah I'm fearless

I ain't holding back 
I know where I stand
I just wanna be with you
You gotta face the fact 
Baby, I'm your man
I've gotta get it through to you
Yeah I'm fearless

I just wanna be with you
I've gotta get it through to you
That I'm fearless
