Lyrics:


Every minute every hour
My love grows in every way,
Every minute every hour
That's the way it goes everyday.

How I wish the days were longer
Every minute one more thrill,
Every hour it grows stronger
And it always will.

I live for tomorrow
For I know what's in store,
I can be sure that tomorrow
Will be sweeter than before.

I'll do all that's in my power
Just to keep the old ways new,
Every minute every hour
I'll spend loving you.

Every minute every hour
I'll spend loving you
