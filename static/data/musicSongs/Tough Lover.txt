Lyrics:


Ooh, oh yeah yeah
Oooh yeah yeah

I need a tough lover, yeah yeah yeah
I need a, a tough lover, woo
I need a, a tough lover, yeah yeah yeah
A tough lover, ooh yeah

When he kisses me, I get that thrill
When he does that wiggle I wonât keep still
I wanna a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (woo)
I need a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
Tough lover (hum, hum)

The seven sisters got nothing on him
Iâm talking about a lover whoâs fast as the wind
Everyone will talk about how he got me fixed
It ainât voodoo, itâs just that twist
He will be the greatest lover that ever come to pass
Don Juan ainât got the half the chance

Heâs a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (woo)
Heâs a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (oh oh)

Hey, hey, heyah
Heâll make me laugh, heâll make me cry
Heâll be so tough heâll make Venus come alive
Heâll do anything that he wants to do
Step on Jesse Jamesâs blue suede shoes, yeah

A tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (woo)
A tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (hey yeah, yeah yeah)
A tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (oh oh)
