Lyrics:


This is the time of year we can give it
Give it, give it, give it all
One through ten on your list you can get it
Get it, get it, get it now

Make your wish tonight
When you open your eyes
When the lights go bright girl
I'll be right there

Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night
Wanna put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies
When your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la

Baby I hear melodies
When your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
I know that it's Christmas time

You got on my favourite dress
You're looking, looking, looking good
Snow falling on your hair
And I don't, I don't wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky
Can't outshine your eyes
Wanna be your biggest gift

Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night
Wanna put my ear to your chest now
Baby I hear melodies
When your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la

Baby I hear melodies
When your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
I know that it's Christmas time

I'll deck your heart with bells of holly
Bells of holly
Fa la la la la la la, fa la la la la la la
Baby 'cause you're the reason to be jolly
Fa la la la la la la, la la la la la la la
Baby girl

I hear melodies
When your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la

Baby I hear melodies
When your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
I know that it's Christmas time

Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Like Christmas
I know that it's Christmas time
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la

Know that it's Christmas time
