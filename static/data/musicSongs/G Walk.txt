Lyrics:


Ayy Royce, you did it right here

Ran in that bitch wit' the Tec, uh-huh
Diamonds they drip from my neck, uh-huh
Hate me because I'm up next, uh-huh
Watch the G-Walk when I step, uh huh

Hop in the coupe goin' crazy (Skrrt, skrrt)
Your baby, she wan' have my baby (Wan' my baby)
She see me whip a Mercedes (Mercedes)
I count these bands on the daily (On the daily)

Run up in your crib, three deep, when you not home
Ran that bitch for the cheese, nigga, like it's Provologne
And I got a stick make you freeze, nigga, Frozone (Bop, bop)
Bandkids been the fucking movement, now we all on (The fuckin' movement)
Last year, I was dead broke, on some stain shit (On some stain shit)
New bitches switching up, they be on that same shit (Lil' bitch)
If you ain't talking money, then you don't speak my language
And free my brother GTAZRECKGLESS, nigga out them cages (Ah!)

Ran in that bitch wit' the Tec, uh-huh (Woo!)
Diamonds they drip from my neck, uh-huh (Bop!)
Hate me because I'm up next, uh-huh (Oh-oh-oh)
Watch the G-Walk when I step, uh huh

Hop in the coupe goin' crazy (Skrrt, skrrt)
Your baby, she wan' have my baby (Wan' my baby)
She see me whip a Mercedes (Mercedes)
I count these bands on the daily (On the daily)

I told my young nigga get it, tell the haters pipe down
I'm tryna fuck a hundred bitches in the hotel right now
My niggas came with the drums, we don't mean percussion
It go ba-dum-bum-bum-bum, ain't no repercussions
I get dollars, and dollars, no refunds
I got bad bitches asking for threesomes
I tell 'em giddy up (Huh), you know they came to have fun
And they ain't about nothin' unless my niggas get some
Had her going up and down like a see-saw
Hit it like I'm Swae Lee, bitch, I'm T'd off
A hunnid shots, bulletproof like I'm Young Dolph
Shotgun sawed off, pro-pro-problem solved, oh yeah

Ran in that bitch wit' the Tec, uh-huh (Woo!)
Diamonds they drip from my neck, uh-huh (Bop!)
Hate me because I'm up next, uh-huh (Oh-oh-oh)
Watch the G-Walk when I step, uh huh

Hop in the coupe goin' crazy (Skrrt, skrrt)
Your baby, she wan' have my baby (Wan' my baby)
She see me whip a Mercedes (Mercedes)
I count these bands on the daily (On the daily)

Wit' that Tec, uh-huh
Drip from my neck, uh-huh
W-W-Wit' that Tec, uh-huh
Drip from my neck, uh-huh
