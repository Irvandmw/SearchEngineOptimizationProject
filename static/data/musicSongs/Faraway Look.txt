Song Name: Faraway Look
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You lit the candles on the cake
And threw the match down on the floor
Wish I knew what you were wishing for
Handing out the paper plates
To all your friends that you adore
Are you haunted and wanting more?

That faraway look in your eyes
It's getting harder to disguise

Nobody moves the way you do
Walking 'round the grocery store
Only you know what you're looking for
And when your working day is through
You walk the darkness to your bed
To dream the dreams that live inside your head

That faraway look in your eyes
It's getting harder to disguise

That faraway look in your eyes
It's getting harder to disguise
