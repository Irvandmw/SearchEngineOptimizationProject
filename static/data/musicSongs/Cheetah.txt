Lyrics:


Should've been
Should've been, should've been honest, oh

How could you do this?
I didn't understand, wasn't in the plan
I wanted your love (Yeah)
It's all up in my head, laltely I forget
I only see you at the parties
Wasted, but you love it
My number blowin' up
You want me to be there for you

I don't feel no way about it
Bet you wake up alone in the morning
Tried to give you a look, oh yeah
But it wasn't enough, oh yeah
And I know that you want me to want it
Tryna get back where we started
I've given a lot, yeah, yeah
But it wasn't enough, yeah, yeah

Cheetah, cheetah
Should've been us (Facts)
But you was just here for the moment
Cheetah, cheetah
Gave you my heart, but you didn't care for it (No)
You're a cheetah
Way that I bounce
I made it a mess, the sleepin' around (Oh)
She want my sympathy (Oh)
It's not how she used to be
(Cheetah, cheetah)

Why you always gotta do me like that?
Ooh baby, I don't understand
I gave you all that you wanted (Oh-oh)
Even if I can lose myself
Haven't you noticed? (Oh-oh, ooh)
What it's like to be with you
Tell me you love me (Oh-oh)
But it was just a joke to you (For you, ooh, ooh)

I don't feel no way about it (Either way)
Bet you wake up alone in the morning
Tried to give you a look, oh yeah (No)
But it wasn't enough, oh yeah
And I know that you want me to want it (Ooh)
Tryna get back where we started
I've given a lot, yeah, yeah
But it wasn't enough, yeah

Cheetah, cheetah
Should've been us (Facts)
But you was just here for the moment
Cheetah, cheetah
Gave you my heart but you didn't care for it (No)
You're a cheetah
Way that I bounce
I made it a mess, the sleepin' around (Oh)
She want my sympathy (Oh)
It's now how she used to be
(Cheetah, cheetah)

Should've been
Should've been, should've been honest, oh-oh
Should've been
Should've been, should've been honest, oh-oh
