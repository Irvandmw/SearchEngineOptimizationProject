Hey, hey
Slim Hood made that
Yeah, yeah

Call my phone, I'm comin' over
Girl, you know I'ma do you right (Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring)
You know we put on a show, girl
You might as well keep on the lights (Might as well keep on the lights)
She do her thing, I be like, "Go, girl"
We can do this shit all night (Do your thing, do your thing)
I ain't to proud to let you know, girl
I'll sing this shit all night (I'll sing this shit all night)
She do her thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
I do my thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
Uh

Whatever she with, then I'm with it (Hey)
Chokin' her out with the pillow (Uh)
We playin' hide and go get it (Ayy)
I ain't had that thing in a minute (Ayy)
She told me, "Let's get on the floor" (The floor)
I told her, "You already know" (You know)
Chokin' her out by her throat
Around and around and she go (Hey)
She tryna give me the business (The business)
I'm tryna get in her kidneys (Her kidneys)
Pullin' out all her extensions (Come here)
That pussy so good, it gon' kill me (Woo)
You know, I'm tryna keep you a secret (Shh)
As long as you promise to keep it
I'm only in town for the weekend

Call my phone, I'm comin' over
Girl, you know I'ma do you right (Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring)
You know we put on a show, girl
You might as well keep on the lights (Might as well keep on the lights)
She do her thing, I be like, "Go, girl"
We can do this shit all night (Do your thing, do your thing)
I ain't to proud to let you know, girl
I'll sing this shit all night (I'll sing this shit all night)
She do her thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
I do my thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
Uh

Whenever I want it, she give it up (Hey)
So when she call my phone, I'ma pick it up (Hey)
I got a whole lot of women but (Yeah)
I fuck with her a little different 'cause (Yeah)
She keep it real, she won't switch it up (Oh yeah)
I keep it real, I don't give a fuck (Oh yeah)
I turned that girl to a savage (Ayy)
That's why she call me her daddy
Soon as I come in the room, take off my boxers, don't do no talking (Hey)
Hop in that thing and go crazy, that's my lil' baby, look how she walking (Muah)
And we keep this thing on a hush (Shh)
Stop thinking, you thinking too much
No reason to be in a rush (Know the number)

Call my phone, I'm comin' over
Girl, you know I'ma do you right (Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring)
You know we put on a show, girl
You might as well keep on the lights (Might as well keep on the lights)
She do her thing, I be like, "Go, girl"
We can do this shit all night (Do your thing, do your thing)
I ain't to proud to let you know, girl
I'll sing this shit all night (I'll sing this shit all night)
She do her thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
I do my thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
Uh, hey
