Lyrics:


To see you is to love you
And I see you everywhere
In the sunrise in the moon glow
Any place I look you're there

To see you is to want you
And I see you all the time
On a sidewalk, in a doorway
On a lonely stairs I climb

Someday let me show you
How happy endings start
You'll find how well I know you
'cause to know you at all is to know you by heart

To see you is to love you
And you're never out of sight
And I love you and I'll see you
In the same old dream tonight

To see you is to love you
And you're never out of sight
And I love you and I'll see you
In the same old dream tonight
