Lyrics:


I admit I don't do nothing fast,
I left town just to get off my ass
Then I learned that there's TV out here too
Same programs that I'm used to.

Made my mind on the temple Faust
Read a book just to go "How'd yourself"
Make the software is given me the keys
All the speakers are descending.

I've been waiting, also thinking,
Lots of planning never working!

Got a lot full of unfinished plans,
Devils always prefer I'm out of hands
Not to say that enjoy my dark side yet
I need all the help I can get!

Never mind what I do with my time
Bet the knuckles to pay off the dimes
People say you can do that to your death
Oh, thank God it's not my last breath!

I've been waiting, also thinking,
Lots of planning never working!

I've been waiting, also thinking,
Lots of planning never working!
Never working
Never working
Never working
Never working
