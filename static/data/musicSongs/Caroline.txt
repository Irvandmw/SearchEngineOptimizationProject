Ah yeah
Hey
Oh yeah
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby!

I had to start it out with some other shit (Ay)
Show these other rap niggas who they fuckin' with
I cut her off, I think it's time to get another bitch (Ay)
I fuck around and pull up on you in another whip (Skrrt)
Don't even need a car, I'm hoppin' out the Uber
Take me to the studio, I'm tryin' to make some music (Ay)
You probably get on Facebook and start another rumor (Huh)
That's another pussy nigga actin' hard on the computer
Goddamn I can't respect, every hater get neglected (Uh huh)
Probably saw his girlfriend takin' pictures in my section
Probably saw my name pop up in the phone, we were textin'
Probably saw me in the club, I ain't see him, I was flexin'
I don't really got the time to talk to you, leave a message
Keep a burner on me, run up, I'ma bless him
Bitch, I'm from Charlotte, RIP to Lil Donk
Every nigga with me a convicted felon with a weapon (Hey hey hey hey)
Baby Jesus or DaBaby baby baby baby
I'ma say it four times 'cause they love the way I say it
Song on the radio, everywhere I go they play it
Top 30 in the nation, that's where everybody hatin' (Top top top)
Chillin' in the condo, eatin' eggs with the bacon
'Bout to fly to Dade County just to pay on my probation (Ay ay)
Keepin' all this show money, I just stack it up and save it
Spendin' all your hoe money, 'bout to go on a vacation (Yeah)
Yeah, I got your baby writin' to me on the Snapchat
In a white tee actin' like she like me (Yeah yeah yeah)
I hit her DM, follow me on IG
She got a boyfriend, he know not to try me (Yeah yeah yeah)
Say you a fan if he ask you why you write me
Tell your homegirl don't worry 'bout who I be
'Cause I ain't with the runaround, it don't excite me
I ain't tryin' to be your man, I'll be your sidepiece

Hey
DaBaby DaBaby DaBaby DaBaby
Haha
Oh yeah
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby!
