Lyrics:


Six in the morning, can I hold you?
Are we done talking? Do we have to?

I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure

I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Got to know for sure
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)

Now I know what you want
But it's too late (Ayy, ayy, ah-ah)
Trying to bring the color of loving
But it won't take (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure

I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Got to know for sure
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)

I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure

I was thinking we were over
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Ahh!
I was thinking we were over
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
I was thinking we were over
Ahh!
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Ayy, ayy, ah-ah!)
I was thinking we were over
