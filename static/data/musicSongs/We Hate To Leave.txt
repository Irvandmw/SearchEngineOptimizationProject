Lyrics:


[Kelly:] We hate to leave.
[Frank:] We hate to leave.

[Both:] But when they give you leave, you gotta leave!
[Kelly:] Oh our hearts bleed for all you guys aboard,
[Frank:] But right now sympathy is a thing we can't afford.
[Kelly:] We hate to leave,
[Frank:] We hate to leave,

[Both:] Without you guys along, we'll even grieve,
[Frank:]
But we'll be back, yes, we'll be back,
Before we're even missed,
[Kelly:] And tell you guys about the countless Dames that we have kissed,
[Both:]
We'll even say, we'll even say,
We really hate to leave.

[Both:]
We hate to leave, we hate to leave,
But when they give you leave, you gotta leave.
[Frank:] No more pin-up gals that we so enjoy.
[Kelly:] Tonight, my boy, we get to meet the real McCoy.
[Both:]
We hate to leave, we hate to leave,
But we'll be back before the night is nigh.

[Frank:] 
We want to stay, we want to stay,
Our hearts are with the ship.
[Kelly:] 
But the Admiral made us take this leave
he beat us with a whip.
[Frank:] 
We'd rather stay,
[Kelly:] Ha, ha, ha, haaa.
[Frank:] we'd rather stay,
[Kelly:] Ha, ha, ha, haaa.
[Both:] we really... hate to leave!
