Lyrics:


Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And I'm trying to get back.

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest.
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.

Listen to the music of the moment,
People dance and sing, we're just one big family.
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved.

So I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait.
I'm sure.

There's no need to complicate.
Our time is short.
This is our fate.
I'm yours.

But don't you want to come on and scooch on over close, dear?
And I will nibble your ear.

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer.
But my breath fogged up the glass,
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.

I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait.
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours

So please don'tâpleaseâdon'tâplease don'tâ
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short.
This oâthis oâthis is our fate.
I'm yours.
