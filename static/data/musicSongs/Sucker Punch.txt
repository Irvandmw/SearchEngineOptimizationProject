Lyrics:


Push and pull me closer 
Habit forming, you should stay far away 

Colored caffeine, magic 
Lights my night up
I'm aware of my fate
It's too late 

After all is said and done
I am not the one
I am not the one

After all is said and done
You are still the one
You are still the one

(Oh) 

Perfect measured pieces
Fit together you and I
Hey bright eyes

Don't deny my weakness
You're the jet
And I'm the stream right behind you 
Behind you 

After all is said and done
I am not the one
I am not the one

After all is said and done
You are still the one
You are still the one

(Oh, ooh) 
(Whoa-a-a-a, oh, oh oh oh) 

After all is said and done
I am not the one
I am not the one

After all is said and done
You are still the one
You are still the one

(Oh, oh oh oh. ooh, ooh) 

(Oh, oh oh oh ooh, ooh)
