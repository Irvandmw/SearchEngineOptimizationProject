Lyrics:


I've cried all the tears tha I have
I don't wanna cry anymore
I'm too young to feel this bad
And too young to now know the score
You promised to love me for good
You did the best that you could
I cried all the tears that I had
So new ones won't do me no good

You better believe me I'm crying for you
If you ever leave me that's not what I'll do

My feelings are tangled like wire
My heart still burns with desire
I've cried all the tears that I had
I won't let them rain on my fire

I gave all the love that I have
I still have a lot more to give
It's better to love and to lose
Than decide that you don't wanna live
We live the best way that we could
But this way of living's no good
I cried for you every day
I can't go on living this way

You better believe me I'm crying for you
If you ever leave me that's not what I'll do

My feelings are tangled like wire
My heart still burns with desire
I've cried all the tears that I had
I won't let them rain on my fire
I won't let them rain on my fire
I won't let them put out my fire
