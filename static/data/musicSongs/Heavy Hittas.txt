Lyrics:


Da real killas
Gorillas
Wig splittas
Heavy hittas
Ya dig it?
Now trip

A lotta niggas like to say what they gon' do
A lotta niggas like to say what they gon' do
But I'ma fuck wid y'all good 'cause I want to
But I'ma fuck wid y'all good 'cause I want to
A lotta people say it's bad for my health
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I'ma mash for myself
I stay fuckin' wit' y'all

Niggas talkin' and perpin' nigga, I curb a nigga
I fuck wit' silent motherfuckers I ain't surpin' niggas
Fuck you actin' motherfuckers pull ya perp nigga
If you scared motherfucker go to church then, nigga
Bust your bubble if a nigga want trouble
Family and money I'm all about the hustle
Hit your chin watch your bitch ass buckle
Fire from the muzzle make a muhfucker grumble
Out the sheeps in the pack, it's the dick that you ride
This faggot muhfucker in the closet he reside
Catch ya outside hit you right between your eyes
Fuck a flesh wound, now he wastin' my time
I got a little money on a bitch in disguise
You know you cannot fuck with my kind
You meet my ass yo' ass gon' comply
'Less yo' bitch ass want yo' time to expire

Da real killas
Gorillas
Wig splittas
Heavy hittas
Ya dig it?
Now trip

A lotta niggas like to say what they gon' do
A lotta niggas like to say what they gon' do
But I'ma fuck wid y'all good 'cause I want to
But I'ma fuck wid y'all good 'cause I want to
A lotta people say it's bad for my health
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm a mash for myself
I stay fuckin' wit' y'all

Aye, I fuck with niggas who strugglin' with the shit
Hear you out over disrespect never a bitch
Industry high breed niggas know what it is
I been hangin' with gorillas and killas since I was ten
Some got good hushed but it's hard to make amends
A nigga apprehend, once you get in it then you in
Your fate, we done followed that
We wasn't feelin' the trend
I'm a Philmore lion and the whole city's a den
Get .40 on you homie the whole thirty within
And the killas' my family we no do the labels or friends
Gonna slide for myself first, before I let them
I pay myself to be my shooter and get it done quick
I got faith in all my niggas I ain't know no punch
Rather keep my niggas free don't want that on my conscience
Just me, a Janko and a couple cartridges
And if I Monday every Friday, then that's when I call 'em in

Da real killas
Gorillas
Wig splittas
Heavy hittas
Ya dig it?
Now trip

A lotta niggas like to say what they gon' do
A lotta niggas like to say what they gon' do
But I'ma fuck wid y'all good 'cause I want to
But I'ma fuck wid y'all good 'cause I want to
A lotta people say it's bad for my health
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm a mash for myself
I stay fuckin' wit' y'all (Fuckin' wit' y'all)
