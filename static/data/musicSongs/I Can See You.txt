Lyrics:


I can feel you
I can see you
See you swimming through the night
See you naked
Feel the water
Running round & round your inner thigh

Make love to me inside the darkness

Now we're walking by the river
Now we're strolling by the lake
Now we're walking to the ocean
I can see you wanna take my hand

Make love to me inside the darkness

I can see your clothes are soaked
By all of the rain that fell
Don't you wonder why it smells that way?
I gave you a rose that day
I took all its thorns away
Don't you wonder why it smells that way?
