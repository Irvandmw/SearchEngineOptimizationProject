Lyrics:


'Lysie, did I listen to that song "Ballin'" in your car, by, uh
I guess it's DJ Mustard and Roddy Ricch?
'Cause if I did I can not get that damn song out my head
And every time it comes on the radio
Iâ Iâ I start boppin' my head
You get on my nerves makin' me listen to this inappropriate music
