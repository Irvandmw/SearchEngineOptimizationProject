Lyrics:


When the whole world puts you down
And makes you feel like a clown
That's not it
You just can't quit

Don't feel sorry for things
'Cause can't you see
I'm still me
And I just can't quit

I can hear the things they're sayin'
You don't know the price I'm payin' now, mmmm
They all laugh and point at me
But I'm gonna laugh the last you see somehow

It's funny how your friends disappear
When troubles they find
But I don't mind
I just can't quit

I can hear the things they're sayin'
You don't know the price I'm payin' now, mmmm
They all laugh and point at me
But I'm gonna laugh the last you see somehow

It's funny how your friends disappear
When troubles they find
But I don't mind
I just can't quit

No, you just can't quit
