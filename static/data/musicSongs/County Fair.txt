Lyrics:


Twenty bucks buys ten coupons
Two ears of corn and one ride on
The tilt-a-whirl with your favorite girl
Keep on walking down the midway
Three-eyed goats and games to play
Step right up, Carney says try your luck
You can tell the sweet smell of summer in the air
Whole town shuts down, everybody's gonna be there

Down at the county fair
Big time, big top, big crowds, big hair 
There's nothing bigger all around
The country anywhere
Than the county fair

Judging pigs and judging pies
Fighting for the first place prize
And have you seen this year's queen
4-H Club and FFA working toward a better day
And a petting zoo, yeah, they got that too
And eight o'clock rolls around, everybody knows
The grandstands open up and it's time for the big show

Down at the county fair
Big time, big top, big crowds, big hair 
There's nothing bigger all around
This country anywhere
Than the county fair

Down at the county fair
Big time, big top, big crowds, big hair 
There's nothing bigger 
All around this country anywhere
Than the county fair

Down at the county fair
Big time, big top, big crowds, big hair 
There's nothing bigger 
In small towns everywhere
Than the county fair
County fair
Yeah, county fair
