Song Name: Breakaway
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


From the fire in your words
To the dagger in your eye
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
I pretend to be asleep
But I know you hear me cry
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down

But if I really want to change
Then I must admit
That I'm the one to blame

If I could breakaway
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty heartache
I could breakaway

Is it true what people say
That it's darkest before dawn?
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
Any hope we might have saved
Is too weak to let live on
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down

And if I really want to change
Then tonight I'm gonna need
All of my strength

If I could breakaway
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty heartache
I could breakaway

Oh, anything is better than this
I know
Anything is better

If I could breakaway
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty heartache
If I could breakaway

If I could turn the page
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty heartache
I could break away
