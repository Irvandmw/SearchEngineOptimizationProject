Lyrics:


Say you love me, say you do
And I'll spend my life loving you too
When today is just a memory
My heart will still belong to you
Say you love me too, say you do

You're my every dream come true
Let me share them all with you
I'll be yours my whole life through
Now and always, I love you

Say you love me, say you do
And I'll spend my life loving you too
When today is just a memory
My heart will still belong to you
Say you love me too, say you do
Say you love me too, say you do
