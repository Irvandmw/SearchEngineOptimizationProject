Lyrics:


Ayo, I never had a car, that's why I hate the fucking bus
Took the 61 to Germantown and hear them guns bust
Call it static, headphones on, it's Illmatic
On my Rosa Parks in the back writin' like B Rabbit
How I carry it, gimme the beat and then I'ma bury it
Producin' tracks for the underground like Harriet
Too alive like twins in the womb, come hither, consume
All of my memories from past and present like two identities
Logic fallin' off is an obscenity
Top five I bet I be, steadily listening
Goddamn, goddamnâconversations with people
Crazy how one day the legends forget that they equal
On this Under Pressure sequel we not takin' it back, we keepin' it pushin'
People scared of change, but you'll find me deep in a cushion
Readin' Nostradamus at 90 degrees, better believe
I turn a prophet with ease
Diacritical lifestyle, I'm always overseas
Hurricane Bobby in the studio blowin' trees
With the topic I drop it fuck around and leave 'em all concussed
When I bust no thrust, world we livin' in is fucked
Industry rule number 4,081
Your new shit ain't good as your old shit
'Til your new shit is your old shit, son
In this sun, let me get some
I wear this 24 karat solid gold rollie for my son as an heirloom
Not for lookin' dope as I rhyme
As a representation to give your family your time
Searchin' for love in the industry you'll be let down
They don't love you 'til you dead and then they call you profound
That's the truth
I'm close to the cliff, like Rick Dalton in the booth
Money ain't the key to happiness and this the proof
Modern day rappers like a golden era spoof
But a few of us resurging within a second, renaissance
And I know that my death give times
Keepin' a legacy goin' by flowin' so involuntarily seamless
Me and my team is finally reapin' what we been sowin' like a seamstress
Now listen up, check it
I said I live by the beat, I die by the beat, since 1990 ah
I live by the beat, I die by the beat, like MPC Akai
Who I name William after 'cause I get bills from these beats
Fuck the industry, know we keepin' it real up in these streets
Came up in a world that's off its axis
All that's promised, death and taxes
And a dope ass tour by L-O-G-I-C
Cordae and JID, but that shit ain't free, now check it
Yeah, and on that note I keep it G
Like track four, kick in the door by BIG
Don't believe me, look that shit up, I promise you'll find the key
To that punchline, I'm feelin' just fine
Let the abyss of my, my, my, my mind consume
Snap my fingers like I'm Thanos and Bobby Boy bringin' the doom
'Cause I'm 630, killin' shit, hands down and dirty
That white boy can't rap, he talk good and act nerdy
Feelin' good yeah, I'm feelin' lovely
Backyard sunset, sippin on that Bubly
Ice Cube in my nightcap, it was a good day
You heard what the hood say, Logic what you should play
Killin' shit like OJ, I'm rhymin' like old Jay
Hip-hop phenom, play arenas like I'm Coldplay
All day, we get it like that, we got it, got it, all day
Sinatra

Nothing but peace, love, and positivity to the whole wide world
RattPack, you already know what it is man
BobbyBoy Records, we out this bitch (Logic)
And I'm havin' a little baby
Surprise, it's a little baby boy
Fuck TMZ, they can't get the scoop on that shit
Welcome little Bobby to the world one time
Alright, I'm done
That's it, yeah
