Lyrics:


Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see?

A star a star dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear?

A song a song high up in the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepard boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm mighty king
Do you know what I know?

A child a child shivers in the cold
We must bring him silver and gold
We must bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say

A child a child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light
