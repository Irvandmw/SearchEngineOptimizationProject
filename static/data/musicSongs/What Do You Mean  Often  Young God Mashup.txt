Lyrics:


You're so indecisive, what I'm saying 
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart 
Don't know if you're happy or complaining 
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
You wanna argue all day, makin' love all night
First you're up them you're down then you're between
Oh I really wanna know what do you mean
When you nod your head yes but you wanna say no
What do you mean
When you don't want me to move but you tell me to go 
What do you-

Asked me if I do this everyday I said often
Asked how many times she rode the wave
Not so often
She down to do it either way
Often
Baby I can make that, make that rain
Often [x3]
Girl I do this often
Make that, make that poppin'
Do it how I want it
Often [x2]
Girl I do this often
Make that, make that poppin'
Do it how I want it

But you're overprotective when I'm leavin'
Tryna compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preachin'
You had me from the start, wont let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
You wanna argue all day makin' love all night
First you're up them you're down then youâre between
Oh I really wanna know what do you mean
When you nod your head yes but you wanna say no
What do you mean
When you don't want me to move but you tell me to go 
What do you mean

In my city I'm a young god, that kill be so vicious 
My god white he be my pocket
He got me redder than the devil till I go nauseous
Asked me if I do this everyday I said often
Asked how many times she rode the wave
Not so often
She down to do it either way
Often
Baby I can make that, make that rain
Often

In my city I'm a young god-god-god-god
but do you feel like a young god, you know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the street with the people underneath and they're runnin' runnin' runnin'
But do you feel like a young god, you know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the street with the people underneath and they're runnin' runnin' runnin'

What do you mean
What do you mean
Said we're runnin' out if time
What do you mean, oh oh oh
What do you mean
Better make up your mind
What do you mean

And we'll be runnin' runnin' runnin'
Again
Runnin' out of time
And we'll be runnin' runnin' runnin' again...
