Lyrics:


Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Ahhh, ahhh
Ahhh, ahhh

This is not religion, but common sense
It's time for you to get down, get down
Get off the fence
No son shall die, no mother shall cry
All in favor, say "aye" (Aye)
Because time's so hard to deal with
Deliverance is at hand, at hand, at hand

Oooh, oooh
Oooh (deliverance, hey, hey) oooh
Ahhh, ahhh
Ahhh, ahhh
(Understand)

Who are they (They)
That would turn a deaf ear to the peaceable ones who bring good news? (Good news?)
With time there will be no wars (Wars)
And the way in which to achieve it
Who got the blues? (Blues)
You can ease the pain of a few (pain) until God intervenes
Ain't nothin', nothin' man can do (can do)
'Cept 'cause each other injury
Somebody say (somebody say)
Katrina levies, oh, oh

Oooh, oooh (Ayy, [?])
Oooh, oooh
(You got to understand)
Ahhh, ahhh
That you'll never [?]
Ahhh, ahhh
[?]
Yeah, you...
Woo! Come on

Because time's so hard to deal with, now understand
Your deliverance is at hand
Because time's so hard to deal with, now understand
Your deliverance is at hand
Oh, oh Lord
