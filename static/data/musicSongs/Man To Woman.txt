Lyrics:


Girl, when the moon across the water starts to rise
I'll be looking for tomorrow and I'll see it in your eyes
Girl, though the strongest heart'll shatter in a storm
Now we got this love that we can run to
Tonight, I'll keep you warm

[CHORUS]
Man to Woman
When you're lying next to me
Man to woman
Girl you're everything I need
Hold on, we'll always be
Always you and me
Hold me close
You're the nearest thing to heaven
That I've known
I can feel the fire that burns inside you
Look how this love has grown

[CHORUS]

Man to woman (man to woman)
Man to woman (man to woman)
Just say we'll always be
Always you and me
I wanna hold you in the night
Can't you see
That I'm just livin' for your light
I want the world to know
I can't let you go

[CHORUS]

Man to woman (man to woman)
Man to woman (man to woman)
I want the world to see
Baby what you mean to me...
