Lyrics:


Aw, don't lose you that light in your eyes
Never to late to love
Never to late to try
When somebody needs you
Give them all you can give
When you live in the love
Your lovin' to live

Stay young keep your wheels in motion
You've got everything that you need
Stay young with your rock an' rollin'
All the best things in life are free

Aw, don't you feel like playin' the fool
Step out of line
Break all the rules
Don't let them tell you
It's not for you
Don't go growin' old
Before you're through

Stay young keep your wheels in motion
You've got everything that you need
Stay young with your rock an' rollin'
All the best things in life are free

Stay young keep your wheels in motion
You've got everything that you need
Stay young with your rock an' rollin'
All the best things in life are free

Stay young keep your wheels in motion
You've got everything that you need
Stay young with your rock an' rollin'
All the best things in life are free
