Ughh
Yeah, yeah

I was broke now a young nigga flexed up
In a foreign switchin' lanes you can't catch up
You was hatin' but you switched up cause I'm next up
I got lean and some forty in my red cup
Bitches changed and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin' money nigga that's my main focus
With 223 and you act like you don't know this
Bro popped a bean man my niggas always rollin'

Y'all tweaking
Me and KK wok we always geekin'
Leakin, yeah my fours leave yo body leaking
I be road runnin' every season
And I just count the bands, my neck is freezin'
DJ Dee, they was softin', we was thuggin'
Outside totin rachets, holdin' on the work we runnin'
Now we counting bands yeah my niggas always thumbin'
And we don't give a fuck cause my niggas always drummin'
I was watching steady plottin', pistol totin'
Mixing beans with my lean, that shit had me floating
I was broke now I'm eating, stomach feeling bloated
I been showed you how to flex
Young nigga wrote it (How to flex)

I was broke now a young nigga flexed up
In a foreign switchin' lanes you can't catch up
You was hatin' but you switched up cause I'm next up
I got lean and some forty in my red cup
Bitches changed and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin' money nigga that's my main focus
With 223 and you act like you don't know this
Bro popped a bean man my niggas always rollin'

I was just a young nigga waiting
But now we up, no worries, getting faded
Playing swear these bitches, they always playing
Saying I could give a fuck about what you saying
Grew up fifty avenue
Tweakers layed up next to dude
Need a bigger revenue
So I stayed tryna sell to you
Niggas always testing me
So I stay with that 32
You can't roll with bros and me
Cause we gon' blast that 22
Yeah, you knew
I said you knew yeah
I turn heads when I roll through yeah
You know I'm with the with the crew yeah
Circle small so it's just 2x2, yeah

I was broke now a young nigga flexed up
In a foreign switchin' lanes you can't catch up
You was hatin' but you switched up cause I'm next up
I got lean and some forty in my red cup
Bitches changed and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin' money nigga that's my main focus
With 223 and you act like you don't know this
Bro popped a bean man my niggas always rollin'
