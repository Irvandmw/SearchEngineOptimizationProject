Lyrics:


Who it is that you want me to be I can't be
I can only do me
I can only go where life takes me
Now who it is that you want me to be I can't be
I can only do me
I can only be how God made me, yeah

Yo
There's only one of me, incredibly uniquely designed
I keep my focus up ahead and leave my worries behind
I know that any goal I wanna reach starts in my mind
I'm kinda dope 'cause I'm one of a kind
I like to take my own path, never following the masses
I do my thing, taking risks, taking chances
I see no boundaries, no impasses
To living my realized dream, keeping music fresh

You do you and I'll do me
Together we'll make harmony
Together we'll make the world go 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round
You do you and I'll do me
Together we'll make harmony
Together we may dance differently but it's all good

I'm easily inspired by the people surrounding me
But still I take pride in my individuality
I might be different from the people in my family
But the truth is their roots keep grounding me
There ain't no mystery to my mastery
I just let myself act naturally
Whatever I dream may not be easy to achieve
But I still believe in equality, so

You do you and I'll do me
Together we make harmony
Together we make the world go 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round
You do you, I'll do me
Together we make harmony
Together we may dance differently but it's all good

I love the way you do you, no pretense
Heart open wide, no fear, no defense
You got your own style, you got your own reason
24/7 rock your own uniqueness
And you got me on my knees, you're my sweetness
You doing you is the ultimate realness
This me-you thing we got, let's keep this
Loving you is much deeper than a reflex
(Reflex, reflex, reflex, reflex, reflex)

Wait a minute, let me stand up for my girls
We never gonna quit till we truly rule the world
Popular thought says we should rule the world
So we gonna march it till our voices get heard
Who it is that you want me to be I can't be
All it is that I'm asking to be is just free
Free to make my choices and raise my voice up
Tell me where my sisters at and make some noise
Come on and sing it with us
She ready

Now you do you, I'll do me
Together we make harmony
Together we make the world go 'round
'Round, 'round

Yo, there's only one of me that ever will be
Never lonely by myself, so I keep doing me
Never phoney, I'm not trippin' on how things should be
I just go with the flow, carefree
Who it is that you want me to be I can't be
Who it is that you're hoping to see, that ain't me
We're just inquisitive kids on a mystic fringe
On a mission to deliver us a happier reality, so

You do you, I'll do me
Together we make harmony
Together we make the world go 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round
Now you do you, I'll do me
Together we make harmony
Together we make love and we'll make it loud
Loud, loud

You do you, I'll do me
Together we'll make harmony
Together we'll make the world go 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
You do you and I'll do me
Together we make harmony
Together we may dance differently but it's all good
(Don't it feel good when you do you?)
