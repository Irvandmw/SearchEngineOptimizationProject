Lyrics:


Nobody ever told me
The final chapter to the story
And if I win or lose
Don't know exactly where I am going
I just keep on rolling
You never know when your time is through

When you fall you gonna hit hard
When you love with your whole heart
Remember the hard times making you

That's when we'll show the world
They're not gonna break us

Hey!
We burn so bright
Making all the people come to life
Hey!
The darkest sky can't stop me and you tonight
(I say) hey!
We burn so bright
Dancing underneath the city lights
Hey!
From way up high
Shining down like stars tonight

When it's too far for me to reach it
I close my eyes and believe it
Ain't no other way to do
When you fall you gonna hit hard
When you love with your whole heart
Remember the hard times making you

That's when we'll show the world
They're not gonna break us

Hey!
We burn so bright
Making all the people come to life
Hey!
The darkest sky can't stop me and you tonight
(I say) hey!
We burn so bright
Dancing underneath the city lights
Hey!
From way up high
Shining down like stars tonight

When you fall you gonna hit hard
When you love with your whole heart
The hard times making you
When you fall you gonna hit hard
When you love with your whole heart
The hard times making you

They're not gonna break us

Hey!
Burn so bright
Making all the people come to life
Hey!
The darkest sky can't stop me and you tonight
(I say) hey!
We burn so bright
Dancing underneath the city lights
Hey!
From way up high
Shining down like stars tonight
