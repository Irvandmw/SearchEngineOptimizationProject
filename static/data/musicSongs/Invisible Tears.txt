Lyrics:


Invisible tears in my eyes incredible pain in my heart
Indestructible memories are passing in review
Impossible though things may get improbable I will forget
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you

You're back again so I'll let you in
Although I'm only seeing pictures from the past
Those arms are not real but somehow I feel
If I'd just close my eyes then maybe it'll last

Invisible tears in my eyes incredible pain in my heart...
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you
