Lyrics:


I love her madly
Need her badly
Don't you see
But I keep her guessing
Keep on pushing boundaries

She's so dramatic
Seems to panic
Ultimately
I want to show her
No need to go there
Honestly

She's a nice girl
No doubt about it
She shows me every day
She's a nice girl
Oh figure it out
Before she walks away

Maybe it's me
Who makes this
Harder than it needs to be
I don't like confrontation
Nothin' that makes me see
(The truth)

I like the path
Of least resistance
But it don't like me
I need to take a good look
At who's in the mirror
Staring back at me

Nice girl
Oh you better figure it out, boy
Nice girl
Nice girl
Don't you let her get away
Nice girl
