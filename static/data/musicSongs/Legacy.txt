Lyrics:


Go down to the sea
Put your ears to the ground
And open your heart to the waves
And the sounds that they make
As they break along the shore
Never more to pass this way again

Open your eyes to the cries of the plane
And look to the skies
For a life that you won't see again
As the silence cuts the glen
Never more to pass this way again

Never coming through here, oh no
My time is through here, that I know

And all that I leave I bequeth to my son
And beg his forgiveness, for all that I've done in his name
As the cycle comes to end
Never more to pass this way again

Never coming through here my friend
I know my road has reached the end

Never coming through here
Never coming through here my friend
Never more to pass this way again
