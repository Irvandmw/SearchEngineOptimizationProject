Lyrics:


There she goes
With the pieces from my heart
There she goes
And now my teardrop starts

And here I go, once again
Through these lonely
Heartaches and pain

That's all remain
All remain
Now I know
Love is a guessing game

And she goes
With the pieces from my heart
There she goes
And now my teardrop starts

Who's gonna put back
The pieces
To my broken heart

Once again, once again
Now I know
This could be the end

And she gone
With the pieces from my heart
There she goes
And now my teardrop start
And here I go once again
Through these lonely
Heartaches and pain
That's all remain
Now I know
This could be the end
And she gone...
