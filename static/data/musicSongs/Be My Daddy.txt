Lyrics:


What's up? [x6]

Lyin' on the beach and the hot sun (yeah hot)
Yeah, I want you
If you have forgotten how to have fun (c'mon)
Well, I'll show you

You rich and I'm wishin' um
You could be my mister, yum
Delicious to the maximum
Chew you up like bubble gum
You love me, He wants me
I think I want you too

You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
I'm neon phosphorescent
Open like a Christmas present, now
You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
If you're seeking heaven
Then you wanna come and get it, get it

You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
I'm neon phosphorescent
Open like a Christmas present, now
You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
If you're seeking heaven
Then you wanna come and get it alright
Be my daddy tonight

I see you shining bright with your gold chain on (so bright)
Drinking with your crew (yeah)
I give you one look and you now that it's on (it's on)
Yes you do

He's rich and I'm kissin' him, magical musician
How we drivin' through the cinema, taste like sugar cinnamon
Hey baby (wha?)
Come take me (wha?)
I'll go anywhere with you (yeah)

You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
I'm neon phosphorescent
Open like a Christmas present, now
You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
If you're seeking heaven
Then you wanna come and get it, get it

You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
I'm neon phosphorescent
Open like a Christmas present, now
You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
If you're seeking heaven
Then you wanna come and get it alright
Be my daddy tonight

What's up? [x8]

Sitting on your lap singing you my song
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Gotta lollipop
I could give you some
I'll fuck you...

You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
I'm neon phosphorescent
Open like a Christmas present, now
You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
If you're seeking heaven
Then you wanna come and get it, get it

You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
I'm neon phosphorescent
Open like a Christmas present, now
You can be my daddy tonight, night, night
If you're seeking heaven
Then you wanna come and get it alright
Be my daddy tonight

What's up? [x4]
Be my daddy [x3]
Be my, be my daddy tonight
