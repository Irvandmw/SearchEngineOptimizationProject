Lyrics:


Let's just enjoy this
Yeah baby we should
We should, we should
Nothing lasts forever
But I better we could
We could, we could

Even if you go before me
I make sure the world still hears your name (you'll live on & on)
I will sing your songs and tell your stories, and
Make sure that you never fade away (you'll live on & on)
No-oh

'Cause we can't live forever
But I'll cherish you until my dying day
Hey-yeah
Let me cherish you
We will always be together
'Cause I'll treasure every memory we make
Hey-yeah
Let me cherish you (you)
Hmm-mhm-hey

Even when we're older (Uh)
We gonna look so fine
So fine, so fine (baby)
Just remember what I told you
"We can take our time"
Let's take our time (take our time)
Uh-huh

Even if you go before me
I make sure the world still hears your name (you'll live on & on baby)
I will sing your songs and tell your stories, and
Make sure that you never fade away (you'll live on & on)
No-oh

'Cause we can't live forever
But I'll cherish you until my dying day
Hey-yeah
Let me cherish you
We will always be together
'Cause I'll treasure every memory we make
Hey-yeah
Let me cherish you (you)

Forever
And ever
I will cherish you always
(Yeah, aha)
Together
Forever
I treasure you, always (baby)

We can't live forever
But I'll cherish you until my dying day
Hey-yeah
Let me cherish you
We will always be together
'Cause I'll treasure every memory we make
Hey-yeah
Let me cherish you, no-no

We can't live forever
But I'll cherish you until my dying day
Hey-yeah
Let me cherish you
We will always be together
'Cause I'll treasure every memory we make
Hey-yeah
Let me cherish you (Let me cherish you)

Forever
And ever
I cherish you always (always)
We will always be together
(Together, forever, I'll treasure)
I cherish you always, oh oh
Let me cherish you
