Lyrics:


See me as I am on my own not trying to find you
No more crying lying next to you

[Chorus:]
Any way you can
Any way you can
Just take my hand
Take my hand
Big bossman

Winter summer fall passes us by both you and I
Out of fashion passion stars in the night

[Chorus x2]

Sitting in picture still all is calm all is bright
Sunshine kissing me watch it and see
You'll get it right

[Chorus]

Any way any way you any way you can... big bossman
Any way any way you any way you can
