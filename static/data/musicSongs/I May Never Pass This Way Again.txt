Song Name: I May Never Pass This Way Again
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I'll give my hand to those who cannot see, 
The sunshine or the fallin' rain. 

I'll sing my song to cheer the weary along, 
For I may never pass this way again! 

I'll share my faith with every troubled heart, 
So I shall not have lived in vain. 

I'll give my hand, I'll sing my song, 
I'll share my faith, because I know, 
That the time is now to fulfill each vow, 
For I may never pass this way again!
