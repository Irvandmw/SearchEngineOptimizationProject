Lyrics:


[Intro: (Kel usually opens the show with his line after Kenan comes up with one of his famous troublesome plans)]
Aww here it goes

[Verse: Coolio]
Everybody out there go run and tell
Your homeboys and home girls it's time for Kenan and Kel
They keep you laughing in the afternoon
So, don't touch that dial or leave the room
'Coz they're always into something
It's fun and you don't wanna miss it
It's double K, like 2 the good radius
Kenan and Kel or should I say Kel and Kenan
But you gotta watch Kenan 'coz
Kenan be scheming
With a plan or a plot
To make it to the top
But they kinda in the middle
'Coz they're always gettin' caught
This ain't the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew mystery
It's just Kenan and Kel in your vicinity
Like Seigfried and Roy, Abbott and Costello
Magic and Kareem, or Penn and Teller
Somebody's in trouble

[Outro: (Correspondence to The First Line, Kel also closes the show with this line after hearing another plan from Kenan, & A famous adlib for Nickelodeon T.V. Station Network)]
Aww here goes
On Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Nick
