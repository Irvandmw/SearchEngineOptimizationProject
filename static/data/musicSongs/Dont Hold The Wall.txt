Lyrics:


[Timbaland:]
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Dance, dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

[Justin Timberlake:]
Come on the floor with them legs,
Was getting down but I get up,
Cause I heard you tell your girlfriend that I deserve better,
Hmph well, I think you look better
But you're so far, I had to come get ya'

Take you to the light,
It's dark in the back
You started moving,
You put a arch in your back
Closer to me, closer to me
Sippin' your drink,
And you're getting closer to me
Dance in the light,
Starting to see,
You started moving,
You're getting closer to me
And now you won't even let me go

[Justin Timberlake & Timbaland:]
So baby hold up,
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Baby hold up,
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't hold the wall.

[T:]
Dance, (You really turn me on)
Dance, don't, don't, don't, hold the wall
Dance, dance, (You really turn me on)
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

[Timbaland:]
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Dance, dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

I think I heard what you said
He's not what you thought and you're fed up
I heard your girlfriend tell you, you could do better,
Well, hmph, I'm the best ever
But you're so far, I had to come get ya'

Take you to the light,
It's dark in the back
You started moving,
You put a arch in your back
Closer to me, closer to me
Sippin' your drink,
And you're getting closer to me
Dance in the light,
Starting to see,
You started moving,
You're getting closer to me
And now you won't even let me go

[Justin Timberlake & Timbaland:]
So baby hold up,
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Baby hold up,
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't hold the wall.

[Justin Timberlake:]
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't hold the wall

[Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
So baby hold up,
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Baby hold up,
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
Let go,
Dance, don't hold the wall.

[Justin Timberlake:]
C'mon and dance,
C'mon baby dance with me
Take my hand,
Get on the floor
C'mon baby dance with me
Please don't hold the wall
Please don't hold the wall tonight
We're gonna do it all,
So please don't hold the wall tonight

[Justin Timberlake:]
C'mon and dance,
C'mon baby dance with me
Take my hand,
Get on the floor
C'mon baby dance with me
Please don't hold the wall
Please don't hold the wall tonight
We're gonna do it all,
So please don't hold the wall tonight

[Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
[J:] Where you running to?
Where you running to?
[T:] Don't hold the wall
[J:] Hey, where you running to?
[T:] Dance, don't hold the wall

Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't hold the wall
