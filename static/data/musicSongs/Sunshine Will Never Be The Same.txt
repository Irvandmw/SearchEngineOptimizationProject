Lyrics:


Sunshine will never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing
Sunshine will never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing

He touched! No! My tears faded away
I'm singing "Oh Happy Day"
He found my heart struggling in the dark
Ad let me out

Sunshine will never be the fright
As a light he put in me
He set me free
And this all world no longer bothers me
My man is my strength and security yeah

Sunshine will never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing
Sunshine will never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing

He's a reason for the change in my behavior
He's been a savior yeah
He's the reason for good living loving and giving
God bless him! Lord!

And I'm back back on the right track
All because of his love sweet sweet love
My happiness not to show it
People see that I'm glowing
I've got my love I've got my love yeah

Sunshine will never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing
Sunshine will never never never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing

Sunshine will never never never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing
Sunshine will never never never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing

Sunshine will never never never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing
Sunshine will never never ever never be the same
I got a new thing I got a hot thing
