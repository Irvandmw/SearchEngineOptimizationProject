Lyrics:


I just sit here
Waiting for you to call
And then I wonder
If you're even calling at all

So many thoughts in my mind
Wishing you could be here all the time

'Cause I'm lost without you
And I can't just doubt you
And there's something about you
I just can't live without you

'Cause I'm lost without you
And I can't just doubt you
And there's something about you
I just can't live without you
