Lyrics:


Another manic Monday
Praying for the week to go by
While Jimmy's at the golf course
Smoking on a Cuban Delight
Now money, money, we all got to make it, yeah
But right now, I could use a vacation

I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
Sunday funday

Another torture Tuesday
I cannot seem to open my eyes
While Suzie's at the dayspa
Getting ready for Jimmy tonight
Now money, money, we all got to make it, yeah
But right now, I just need a vacation

I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
Sunday funday

We don't wanna work no more
Life is just too short
Now money, money, we all got to make it, yeah
But everyday should be a vacation

I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
Sunday funday
We don't wanna work no more
Life is just too short
