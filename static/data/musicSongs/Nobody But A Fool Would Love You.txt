Lyrics:


Nobody but a fool would love you after the way you've done me.
Broke every vow you made me broke every rule.
Who'd lie awake all night crying till you were out of sight.
Loving you with all of his might nobody but a fool.

I don't know what it was that made me trust you like I did.
Stars got in my eyes or either rocks got in my head.
All I knew was your two lips kissed me heavenly.
Till yestreday those tender lips kissed goodbye to me.

Well nobody but a fool would love you after the way you've done me.
Broke every vow you made me broke every rule.
Who'd lie awake all night crying till you were out of sight.
Loving you with all of his might nobody but a fool.

People tried to tell me how you'd hurt me I suppose.
But I was blind as any bat deaf as any post.
You clawed me like a tiger I loved you like a lamb.
And knowing I still do just shows me up for what I am.

Well nobody but a fool would love you after the way you've done me.
Broke every vow you made me broke every rule.
Who'd lie awake all night crying till you were out of sight.
Loving you with all of his might nobody but a fool.Nobody but a fool
