Lyrics:


The ferris wheel it turns 360
my appetite for love is drifting
you sorta of caught my eye baby 
just aint take my ticket ooh you just so tempting 
it's been sweet like love it's crazy
I'm standing here in line just waiting
for you to notice me
I hope you give me achance,
baby you must underastand
It's like my eye is on apriza I lost myself     
with her tonight for alittle bit fun, 
alot of bit of buzz
Her kiss was like some cotton candy love
she got me spinnin' round and round  
I'm lost inside of her fun house 
somehow she gained my trust I know just what 
it was her kiss was like some cotton candy love
like candy apple dipped in chocolate
she wore me out,I'm so exhasted she
emptied out my heart my wallet
And now I'mbeggin' baby please stop this,
I'm locked inside this silent movie and 
I can't speak no words
Oh no you didn't, oh
you no you did it 
you took the shot but I payed the cost
It's like my eye is on apriza I lost myself
with her tonight for alittle bit of fun,
alot of bit of buzz
Her kiss like some cotton candy love
she got me spinnin' round and round I'm lost
inside of her fun house
somehow she gained my trust Iknow just 
what it was her kiss was like some
cotton candy looove
love..love..love..love
love..love..love..love
you took the dice and you rolled and 
now you takin' control you got me 
sweatin' heavy makin' me so crazy you know
And now you're ready to leave don't 
tell me you're just tease
I'm nearly crying,
beggin', pleading for 
you to stay with me (stay with me)
It's like my eye is on aprize (on aprize)
I lost myself with her tonight (I lost myself)
for alittle bit of fun, alot of bit of buzz
her kiss was like some cotton cundy love
(just like some cotton candy love)
she got me spinnin' round ana round (spinnin' round)
I'm lost inside of her fun house (oh no, oh no)
somehow she gained my trust
I know just what it was (I no just what it was) her kiss was
like some cotton candy love
(just like some cotton candy love)
