Get 'em

Living life on the east coast
Way back in the day trying to beat most
Anybody that wanna do what I do
Well let me keep it one hunna with you
It ainât about that
Ainât about Hip Hop
Ainât about Rap
Think a minute, hold up, use your cap
Chicago, know Iâmma snap
Gotta say, no basic rapping

So they wonder who am I, so high
I said they wonder who am I, so high

Back again, never outside so Iâm acting in
I laugh again when they donât understand what I mean, bias
Everybody seen by us
Everybody wanna live a life like this
Man fuck that, do whatâs good for your family
Make music like thereâs no Grammy
For that last line they might ban me
I donât give a fuck though
Cause I am me
From Beijing to Miami
Iâmma just do what I do with my crew
Ainât no telling what Iâm finna do
But I promise that Iâmma keep writing for you
And I know what to do
Everything right here for you
Only for you, depending on what you gonna do

Itâs all for you
Itâs all for you
Who am I, so high
I said they wonder who am I, so high

Let me take the time to find the rhyme
And let you know that Iâm the only one
To find the one the time is done
Beyond the sky, beyond the sun
There is no one besides the only one
And you know I gotta let âem know
If you love it, let it go
At an all time low and all I know is, all I know
I do what I love
Came from below when there was no one above
Created a world no one has been to
Everything that Iâm into
Everything that Iâve been through
Bring it back like, let it shine like a bad light
Reminisce ainât know that night
Gotta take flight
Everybody probably wonder what Iâm living like
In the middle of the night I might write
Despite what they say is right and wrong
Despite they wonder (wonder)

Who am I, so high
I said they wonder who am I, so high

Weâd like to be painters, weâd like to be poets.
Weâd like to be writers, but as everybody knows we canât earn any money that way.
What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do,
I will say to him you do that.. and uhm, forget the money.
If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time

Youâll be doing things you donât like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you donât like doing, which is stupid!
It is absolutely stupid!
Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way.
And after all, if you do really like what youâre doing, it doesnât matter what it is â
somebody is interested in everything, anything you can be interested in, you will find others will

But itâs absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you donât like, and to teach our children to follow in the same track.
See what we are doing, is weâre bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lives we are living.
In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing,
so itâs all retch, and no vomit it never gets there. Therefore, itâs so important to consider this question: What do I desire?
