Lyrics:


I wanna build you up (Brick by brick)
I wanna break you down (Brick by brick)
I'm gonna reconstruct (Brick by Brick)
I wanna feel your love

Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)

I wanna steal your soul (Brick by brick)
I wanna rock and roll (Brick by Brick)
I wanna rock and roll (Brick by brick)
I wanna rock and roll

Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)

I want a brick by brick (Brick by brick)
I want a blow by blow (Brick by brick)
I want an episode (Brick by brick)
I want a brick by brick, by brick, by

Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
