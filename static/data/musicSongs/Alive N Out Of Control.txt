Lyrics:
Lyrics:


For crying out loud I'm running from a comedown
God forbid I know I've been a letdown
Reaching for the sky while laying in a gutter
Kicking and screaming I am singing bloody murder

[chorus:]
I'm alive when I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control, I'm losing my soul
I'm alive when I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control, I'm losing my soul

I can't be your angel when I'm living like a devil
Can't be your lover when I'm living like a rebel
Don't want your pity and I don't want your help
Don't try and save me go take care of yourself
Go take care of youself
you better take care of yourself

[chorus]

I'm alive! Sick of the pain I'm sick of the sorrow
Sick of today I'm sick of tomorrow
I'm addicted to the misery in my head
I better stop before I end up dead

So I climb to the top just to fall to the bottom
And I climb to the top just to fall to the bottom
come on, come on, come on!

[chorus]

I can't be your angel when I'm living like a devil
Can't be your lover when I'm living like a rebel
Don't want your pity and I don't want your help
Don't try and save me go take care of yourself
