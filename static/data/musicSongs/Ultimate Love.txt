Lyrics:


Ain't no winners when you're dropping bombs
Why can't we all just get along?
I say yeah
We can make it happen, we can make it better
There's just one world we gotta live together
I say yeah

If I know one thing
We're all searching for something
We're all looking for love
The ultimate love

Too many people livin' on the street
Can't make the rent, can't make ends meet
I say yeah
Everybody wants a quick solution
Step right up and make a contribution
I say yeah

If I know one thing
We're all searching for something
We're all looking for love
The ultimate love
Now here's the main thing
We all want the same thing
We're all looking for love
The ultimate love

Flip a coin, peace or war
Seems the free world ain't so free no more
I say yeah
Just imagine how bad it could be
If you ain't scared, I think you should be
I say yeah

If I know one thing
We're all searching for something
We're all looking for love
The ultimate love
Now here's the main thing
We all want the same thing
We're all looking for love
The ultimate love

Looking for love, ultimate love
Looking for love, ultimate love
Ultimate love
