Lyrics:


Hey now
Hey now

Hey now
Hey now

Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
When I see you smiling, I go
Oh oh oh
I would never want to miss this
'Cause in my heart I know what this is

Hey now
Hey now
This is what dreams are made of
Hey now
Hey now
This is what dreams are made of
I've got somewhere I belong
I've got somebody to love
This is what dreams are made of
(Hey now...)

This is what dreams are made of

Have you ever wondered what life is about?
You could search the world and never figure it out
You don't have to sail the oceans
No no no
Happiness is no mystery it's
Here now it's you and me

Hey now
Hey now
This is what dreams are made of
Hey now
Hey now
This is what dreams are made of
I've got somewhere I belong
I've got somebody to love
This is what dreams are made of
(Hey now...)

Open your eyes
(This is what dreams are made of)
Shout to the sky
(This is what dreams are made of)

Then I see you smiling, I go
Oh oh oh
Yesterday my life was duller
Now everything's Technicolor

(Hey now)
(Hey now)
Hey now
This is what dreams
This is what dreams are made of
Hey now
Hey now
This is what dreams are made of
I've got somewhere I belong
I've got somebody to love
This is what dreams are made of
(Hey now)
(Hey now)
Hey now
This is what dreams
This is what dreams are made of
