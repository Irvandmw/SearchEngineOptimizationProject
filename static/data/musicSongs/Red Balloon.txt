Lyrics:


Got myself a red balloon
Got a blue surprise
Gettin' in the red balloon
Pinnin' up my eyes
Take a love light from my eyes
Blue, blue surprise

Played with toys for children
As a a child I got
Haven't any time for children
Although I got a lot
I took a love light from my eyes
Blue, blue surprise
We met as friends
And you were so easy to get to know
We'll see each other again
Oh my, I hope so

Played with toys for children
As a a child I got
Haven't any time for children
Although I got a lot
I took a love light from my eyes
Blue, blue surprise
Got myself a red balloon
Got a blue surprise
Everything's a red balloon
Fillin' up my eyes
