Lyrics:


You are everything to me
And I, I would die for you
There've been times when I'm up all night
Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on
I've heard I've got words like a knife
That I don't always choose just so wisely
But I see trees and the colored leaves
When I think about all that we could be

And when you're gone, time moves so slow
And like the grass, I've watched us grow
I heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I never let you know?

But you are everything to me
You're sweeter than candy cane, better than any childhood dream
I am yours, and you are mine
I have your heart, I don't even need your ring
I'd give up all I have in exchange for who I love more than anything

When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I ever let you go?

You, you are everything to me
And I, I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you

When you're gone, time moves so slow (I would die)
Like the grass, I've watched us grow (I would die)
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow (I would die)
How could I never let you know? (I would die for you)
