Lyrics:


(Uh)
The Versace Experience
(Mmm)
The Versace Experience
(Mmm, oh)
The Versace Experience
The Versace Experience

Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down

In the daytime, ha, I think not!
I'd rather do you after school like some homework
Ah... am I getting you hot?
(Hot)
In my bedroom (No!) 'cause then we'd have to stop
(Please don't stop)
I'd rather wait until everyone's fast asleep
Then do it in the kitchen on the table top, oh!
We gotta break it on down (down, down, down)
Can you hear me girl?

Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down

Are you listening, baby?
Ah hear me baby, hear me baby
(We gotta break it on down, down, down)
You making me want to ... oh!
Uh (Uh)
There it is
Uh (Uh)
Oh yeah
All night long
Are You diggin' this, baby? (Oh)
Down, down, down, down

(Shhh - break it down)
(Shhh - break it down)
(Shhh - break it down)
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Sex is not all I think about
It's just all I think about you
