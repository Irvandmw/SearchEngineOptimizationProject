Lyrics:


The doors are open and you're on your way
The eyes of the world are on you to day
Fire is deep in your heart
Desire burning from the start
Your feeling like a winner deep inside 

[Chorus:]
Dreaming of gold body of steel
driving you on making you feel
Second to none united again
You carry the eternal flame 

Breaking the records for power and speed
Your faith in yourself now is all that you need
Tears when chances are gone
Joy for the lucky ones
and then we celebrate a world who join as one 

[Chorus:]
Dreaming of gold body of steel
driving you on making you feel
Second to none united again
You carry the eternal flame
