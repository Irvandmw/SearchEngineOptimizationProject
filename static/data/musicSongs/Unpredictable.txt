Lyrics:


She sits at home with the lights out
Seeing life in different colours
I think itâs time that we wake up
So let me take you away

We can run down the street
With the stars in our eyes
We can tear down this town
In the dark of the night
Just open the door
Weâve got time on our side
We can make it out alive

Hey weâre taking on the world
Iâll take you where you wanna go
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you
Break the plans we had before
Letâs be unpredictable
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you

It took so long to convince you
I knew I had to show my colours
You never wanted to be rescued
But now weâre drifting away

We can run down the street
With the stars in our eyes
We can tear down this town
In the dark of the night
Just open the door
Weâve got time on our side
We can make it out alive

Hey weâre taking on the world
Iâll take you where you wanna go
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you
Break the plans we had before
Letâs be unpredictable
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you

Earthquakes wonât wait for another day
Donât say I know I never said it
I never said it, oh
One day we can make it out alive

Hey weâre taking on the world
Iâll take you where you wanna go
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you
Break the plans we had before
Letâs be unpredictable
Pick you up if you fall to pieces
Let me be the one to save you

So let go!
Tillâ we've lost control
And weâll stumble through it all
Letâs do something new and unpredictable
