Lyrics:


[Justin Bieber:]
You asked me to come over (over)
You said that you would be alone (alone)
And when I got there for you
Someone was in your room
You gotta play these games with me
And all I could do is slam the door
Can't stand you anymore (you're breaking me down, down)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, woah

You know exactly what to do to hurt me (hurt me)
It's working (it's working)
It's working
You know exactly what to do to hurt me (hurt me)
It's working (it's working)
It's working

But was it worth it? (woah)
To lose me forever
Did I deserve it? (Maybe, maybe)
I guess it's making me better, making me better
[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, woah

[Euro:]
Euro
Let's play, I trust you and you trust me (okay, go)
Anything you wanna say to me
Any song you wanna play for me, play slow
I take my time to listen, don't waste your time and listen
'Cause they say love will kill you, let me say my dying wishes
Ain't this world is so called riskers?
Girl it's your call to risk it
You called I had to pick up to make up for all my misses
But when we're together, you act like a different artist
So I painted this to show you I'm better at being heartless, you know

[Justin Bieber:]
You know exactly what to do to hurt me
It's working, it's working
You know exactly what to do to hurt me, yeah (oh yeah, yeah)

Oh yeah, yeah...
You know exactly how to hurt me
It's working, it's working
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah, woah
