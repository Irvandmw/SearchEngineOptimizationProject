Song Name: I'll String Along With You
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You may not be an angel
'Cause angels are so few
But until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

I'm looking for an angel
To sing my love song to
And until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

For every little fault that you have
Say I have three or four
The human little fault that you do have
Just make me love you more

You may not be angel
But still I'm sure you'll do
So until that day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

For every little fault that you have
Say I have three or four
The human little fault that you do have
Just make me love you more

You may not be angel
But still I'm sure you'll do
So until that day that one comes along
I'll string along with you
