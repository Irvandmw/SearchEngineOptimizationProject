Lyrics:


(I'll make it up to you)
(I'll make it up to you)
(I'll make it up to you)

I wanna make it up to you
(Yes, I do)
For all the things I put you through
(Yes, I do)
Please forgive me for the lies
(Tear stained eyes)
I sincerely apologize

Darling, realize
It's too much to let go now
If I wasn't sure, believe me this I know now
You're the only one
Come back, my morning sun
(All I wanna do)
Is I wanna make it up to you, boy

I wanna love you in the night, yeah
(Do it right)
Let's do this thing, girl, do it right
(Give it time)
Let's put the pieces back in place
Put 'em there, baby (no time to waste), yeah
No one will ever share your space
I've gotten over you (yes, yes)
Everything about you now (pretty baby)
But still I reminisce (and I'm free)
Yes, I really doubt you now
Restore my trust and faith
Come back, don't hesitate
(All I wanna do)
I wanna make it up to you girl/boy, yeah

You know if we could try, just one more time
Hey baby, I promise you
That my star will shine, oh yeah
And if you should ever reach for the moon
And fall among the stars
Just let me be, well
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Oh darling, ooh darling
Oh darling, oh darling
Sweet baby, sweet baby

Gotten over you, gotten over you
And everything about you now, everything about you now
Still I reminisce, still I reminisce
Yes, yes, and I really doubt you now, really doubt you now
Restore my trust and faith, do it, do it, do it, girl
Come back, don't hesitate
'Cause all I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is I wanna make it up to you, boy/girl
I wanna make it up to you, boy/girl
Yeah, I wanna make it up to you, boy/girl
Umm, baby
I wanna make it up to you, boy/girl

(Make it up to you, girl)
Make it up, make it up, make it up
Your big brown sexy eyes, baby
(I wanna make it up to you, boy) (make it up to your, girl)
I'm so glad, so glad I realized (hey, wanna make it up to you, girl)
I love everything about you, girl
Do you really? Tell me about it
Yes, I do
Tell me now
All night long
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Those brown shoes are gonna rip and fall apart
Pretty red dress, you say you need it
I'll find a way somehow
Well, well
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you handle yourself
And I love it when you love me, girl
In a room full of other men, you rise and you stand above everybody else
I can see the envy of their eyes
Oh, baby
When you and I walk off, ey girl
Sweet thing
Sweet baby
Sweet, sweet thing
Sweet thing
Aw, won't you do it again now
One more, one more, one more
Ey, one more time
One more, one more, one more
Make it up to me, baby
Do the best I can
Make it up to me, baby
Do the best I can
Love ya, love ya, love ya
Be the kind of man
