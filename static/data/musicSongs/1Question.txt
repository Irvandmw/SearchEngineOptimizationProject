Lyrics:


Hear me knockin, Iâll be knockin on your door
Hear me knockin, Iâll be knockin on your door

I just got one question to ask, do you love me? (do you love me?) [x4]

I just got one question to ask, do you love me? love me
You said you do but Iâm not sure if you love me, love me
I just got to know right now do you really love me? do you really love me?

I just got one question to ask, do you love me? (do you love me?) [x4]

Insecurity, be askin heavy questions, heavy questions
Donât know why I feel this deep expression, expression
Itâs so heavy heavy on my face and my mind
I keep letting it spoil my grind
Just got to go, itâs that time

I just got one question to ask, do you love me? (do you love me?) [x4]

L-O-V-E
Do-you-love-me?
L-O-V-E
Do-you-love-me?

I just wanna know, do you really really care?
Just wanna know will you always be there?
Will you always be there?
Or is this a con to get what you want
Cus you really donât care

I just need you near me
Hear me, feel me homie, love me only
And if you can do that for me
Hold me back like you owe me
Click clock, hip-hop
Ready or not?

Ready or not not not not not not here
Ready or not not not, that means ready or not
Ready or not not not not not not here
Ready or not not not, that means ready or not

Not not not not not not here
Not not not, that means ready or not
Not not not not not not here
Not not not, Iâll make love to you girl

I just got one question to ask, do you love me? (do you love me?) [x4]
