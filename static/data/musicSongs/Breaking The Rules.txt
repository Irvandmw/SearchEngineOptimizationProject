Lyrics:


On the street you are listening to every beat of your heart
Want to know if it's working and you're still alive
On your feet you are walking around with your clothes torn apart
In a nightmare where the question is how to survive 

In this dangerous land 
I'm trying the best that I can
To be a respectable man 
So won't you listen won't you listen to me 

[Chorus:]
I'm breaking the law if you don't give me more than public attention
I'm breaking the rules gonna act like a fool 

On the street you are looking so hard for a place for the night
All you want is understanding of your basic rights 

In this dangerous land 
I'm trying the best that I can
To be a respectable man 
So won't you listen won't you listen to me 

[Chorus:]
I'm breaking the law if you don't give me more than public attention
I'm breaking the rules gonna act like a fool
I'm crossing the line if you don't give me time on your television
I've got something to say don't push me away
