Lyrics:


Sing a mean tune, kid
Sock 'em in the gut, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing a mean tune, kid, oh yeah
Sock 'em in the gut, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you ever let your mama catch you cryin'
Woo ooh yeah

Play the bad song, kid
Everyone's the blues, yeah, yeah, yeah
Play the bad song, kid
Everyone's the blues, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the people never know you're only lyin'
Woo hoo, sing a mean tune

What a scary song, kid
Never heard before, yeah, yeah, yeah
What a scary song, kid
Never heard before, yeah, yeah, yeah
Soon the groupies will start rollin' by your door
Look out
Oh yeah

Burn the groove to death, kid
Nail 'em to the cross, yeah, yeah, yeah
Burn the groove to death, kid, oh yeah
Nail 'em to the cross, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Til you're not a super pop star any more, yeah
Ooh hoo, sing a mean tune
Oh yeah
