Lyrics:


Oh, people, won't you leave my dog alone
People, won't you leave my dog alone
All he ever did was wag his tail
People why did you have to throw my dog in jail
Oh, people, won't you leave my dog alone

Hey, people, won't you leave my cat alone
People, won't you leave my cat alone
He never said a bad word, no, not him
Why to throw him in the river, people, he can't swim
Oh, people, won't you leave my cat alone

Now, people, won't you leave this girl alone
I said, people, won't you leave this girl alone
I know exactly where it's at for me
Just let me be the way I wanna be, yeah
People, won't you leave this girl alone
