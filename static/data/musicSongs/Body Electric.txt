Lyrics:


Elvis is my daddy, Marilynâs my mother,
Jesus is my bestest friend.
We donât need nobody
'Cause we got each other,
Or at least I pretend.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancinâ and grindinâ in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, we're feelinâ alright,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.
(I said don't worry about it)

[Chorus:]
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
Iâm on fire,
Sing that body electric.

Whitman is my daddy, Monacoâs my mother,
Diamonds are my bestest friend.
Heaven is my baby, suicideâs her father,
Opulence is the end.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancinâ and grindinâ in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, we're feelinâ alright,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.
(I said don't worry about it)

[Chorus:]
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
Iâm on fire,
Sing that body electric.

My clothes still smell like you,
And all the photographs say youâre still young.
I pretend Iâm not hurt
And go about the world like Iâm havinâ fun.

We get crazy every Friday night,
Drop it like itâs hot in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, feelin' all right
Mary's swayinâ softly to her heart's delight.

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
Iâm on fire,
Sing that body electric.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.
