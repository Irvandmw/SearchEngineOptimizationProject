Lyrics:


(I got 20 on my beat)
Everybody know my name ringing bells, ringing bells like the hallway
I ain't gotta cap in no muhfuckin' rap, I'll whip out and air it out broad day
I got in with that stick and I'm with that
Break a nigga in half like a kit-kat
I've been tryna be positive, mama
They ain't fucking with Jonathan, mama (Nope)
Who you know put they muhfuckin' self on the map and now they don't owe nobody shit? (Me)
I send one of my lil' niggas come take you off, you get laid on the floor by a jit
Got pulled over with 55K in my pocket, the police, they know I'm legit
The police they know I got sticks, they be worried about me
They know I'm a clique
These niggas they know I'm a dog, I ain't worried about em'
I know he a bitch
The next nigga that come play with me, I'ma send him to go ask Tupac for a pic (Bitch)
They say I'm the hottest new nigga, go check the thermometer, that nigga sick (Hot)
Nigga must have a fever or something
Heard he was born up in Cleveland or something
Let me give you a history lesson, we moved back to Charlotte 1999 (Okay)
I ain't saying that none of that matters
'Cause if somebody touch me then somebody dying (No cap)
Why he talking so calm when he say that?
How he make em' rewind and replay that?
Who you know get a fade once a week and they tryna get waves
Fuck a muhfuckin' wave cap
Every time that the DJ play 'Suge' niggas throw up they arms like a muhfuckin' race track
Every time that my baby girl see me, she run and say daddy
I love when she say that
Every time I hit one of my moves all the bitches go crazy
They like how I do that
I keep one in the head
If I don't let off first, I'ma dive to the side when I shoot back
Yeah I'm coming like Blade in this bitch
Fuck around and walk down in a trench coat
They gon' have to put me with the greats
Wanna fuck with me? She gotta wait (Bitch)

One the yacht with me, me, and the kid (It's four of us)
We on the sea eating steak (Yup)
I won't go back and forth with a shrimp
You going out sad about a hoe, I'm a pimp
He keep bumping his muhfuckin' gums
We gone put his ass up like a muhfuckin' blimp (Bitch)
Like to talk on the pillow with hoes, that's gone get em' exposed
He a muhfuckin' simp
You know he got that thang on em' baby
Quit asking him why that boy walk with a limp
I don't care bout this muhfuckin' chain
But I still buss yo muhfuckin' brain
Just got head on a muhfuckin' plane
Ain't no cap in my rap, I'm the truth
End up fucking this hoe from the back
I knew her for a day, she on go, she the swoop
And these niggas ain't living like that
Why he talking so gangsta?
Yo bro, he a fluke
They know Baby gone blow, he a flute
They know Baby gone blow, he the bomb
They know Baby was just in Miami, now he in LA
Nigga think he Lebron

They know Baby go Baby on Baby
But five years ago, nigga say he was Jon
I touched down at the front of the plane
And the driver come pick up my Louis Vuitton (Dumb fast)
While he drive me around I be blowing out pressure
I'm chilling back seat with the iron
Bitch
