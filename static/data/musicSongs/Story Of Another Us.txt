Lyrics:


Replay the scene over again
Before the credits rolling in
Inside my head
I don't recall a single word,
You hit me faster than I heard
Inside my head

And now I'm shaking, wearing thin
I always wonder where you'd been
Tell me if you wanted it at all

I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us

Memories are pay-per-view,
It costs too much to think of you
I'm hanging by a thread
An epilogue before we're done,
A sequel to what we've begun
I'm hanging by a thread

And now before our hope is lost
My heart is here, it's such a cause
Tell me if you wanted it at all

I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us

Draw me, beside you
Where I'll be to remind you
We're still first in line for
The front row of last resorts

One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on

I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us
