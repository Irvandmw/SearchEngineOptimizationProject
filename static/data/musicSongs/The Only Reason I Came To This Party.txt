Lyrics:


I'm stuck inside this room
Tryna play it cool
While I'm looking for you
Tryna play it cool
While I'm looking for you
I didn't wanna go
But I had to let you know
That I'm falling for you
I need to let you know
That I'm falling for you

People everywhere
I'm pushing through this crowd
I'm sober, I don't even care
I hope when I walk upstairs
That I won't be let down
I just wanna see you standing there

You're the only reason I came to this party
So I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody
Everybody's wasted on their phones
I wanna find a place we can be alone
Cause you're the only reason I came to this party
I came to this party

So, are you making moves
And what you been up to
It's killing me slowly
When all I wanna do is get a second with you
The music's too loud
Just wanna hear the sound of you saying softly
"We can leave now, we got nothing to lose"

People everywhere
We're pushing through this crowd
Until we walk right outta here

You're the only reason I came to this party
So I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody
Everybody's wasted on their phones
I wanna find a place we can be alone
Cause you're the only reason I came to this party
I came to this party
I came to this party yeah

You're the only reason I came to this party
So I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody
Cause everybody's wasted on their phones
I wanna find a place we can be alone
You're the only reason I came to this party
I came to this party yeah
I came to this party
I came to this party
Cause you're the only reason I came to this party
I came to this party
