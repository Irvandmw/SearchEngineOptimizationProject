Fuckin' a rich nigga daughter, yeah (Water)
Water, water, water, water, water

I'm fuckin' a rich nigga daughter (Oh yeah)
She suckin' my dick, I record her (Ayy, ayy)
My swag it be drippin' just bought her
Got a model bitch livin' in Florida (For real)
Got a bitch from the hood out in Georgia (Hey)
And my other lil' bitch a New Yorker
That's that water
Water, water, water, water (Drip)
Water, water, water, water (Drip)
Water, water, water, water (Oh yeah)
I'm fuckin' a rich nigga daughter (Oh yeah)
She suckin' my dick, I record her (Ayy)
Swag it be drippin', it's water (Drip)
Swag it be drippin', it's water (Turn up, turn up)
Water

I got that shit by the gallon (Oh yeah)
I walked in that bitch with' a stallion (Drip)
They think my bitch from an island (Woo)
I saw your bitch, she was smilin' (Ha)
My nigga said "get her," I got her (Got her)
I just got a new broad in Atlanta (Hey)
I pulled up on the rock in designer (Grr, yeah)
Got the black and white bitch like a panda
They both sit on my dick, I'll be Santa (Oh yeah)
I'm in love with my bitch up in Brooklyn (New York)
But my baddest bitch down in Miami (Florida)
And don't none of my bitches drink soda (No)
So you won't her sippin' no Fanta (Drip)
I jump in that shit like the ocean (Whoosh)
When I swim in that pussy, I'm dancin' (Ayy, ayy)
Man that's that

Water
Water, water, water, water (Ayy)
I'm fuckin' a rich nigga daughter (Oh yeah)
She suckin' my dick, I record her (Ayy, ayy)
My swag it be drippin', just bought her
Got a model bitch livin' in Florida (For real)
Got a bitch from the hood out in Georgia (Hey)
And my other lil' bitch a New Yorker
That's that water
Water, water, water, water (Drip)
Water, water, water, water (Drip)
Water, water, water, water (Oh yeah)
I'm fuckin' a rich nigga daughter (Oh yeah)
She suckin' my dick, I record her (Ayy)

I need to get me fountain (Ayy)
Got a yellow bitch in Arizona (For real)
She live way up in the mountains (Turn up)
Got a plug that live in California (Ayy)
He just sent over 32 ounces (Oh yeah)
Had to drop of some bread for my lawyer
'Cause I can't keep my ass out the county
I don't want no bitch niggas around me (Who is he)
Who is he? Get him from 'round me (Who)
I'm the one hit your boy with that.40 (Boo)
So you better go ask him about me (Ha)
You see did these hoes used to ignore me (Oh yeah)
Now when I hit the club they surround me (Oh yeah)
In the VIP standing on couches (Hey)
And tonight, please don't bring me no bottle (Turn up, turn up)
I'm drinkin'

Water
Water, water, water, water (Ayy)
I'm fuckin' a rich nigga daughter (Oh yeah)
She suckin' my dick, I record her (Ayy, ayy)
My swag it be drippin', just bought her

Got a bitch from the hood out in Georgia (Hey)
And my other lil' bitch a New Yorker
That's that water
Water, water, water, water (Drip)
Water, water, water, water (Drip)
Water, water, water, water (Oh yeah)
I'm fuckin' a rich nigga daughter (Oh yeah)
