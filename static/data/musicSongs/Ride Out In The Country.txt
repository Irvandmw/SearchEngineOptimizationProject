Lyrics:


I take a ride out in the country
Get some wind in my hair
Let it all go like I ain't got a care

I take a ride out in the country
In the soft summer breeze
Forgetting about you
Forgetting about me

Falling out of love with you
Is not an easy thing to do
But you don't care about me, baby
Running here is all I know
The country satisfies my soul
When I think I'm goin' crazy

I take a ride out in the country, it's all I can do
Where the whipper well sings a song so blue

Falling out of love with you
Is not an easy thing to do
But you don't care about me, baby
Running here is all I know
The country satisfies my soul
When I think I'm goin' crazy

I take a ride out in the country
In the soft summer breeze
Forgetting about you
Forgetting about me
