Lyrics:


It's a party on the weekend, know you been working hard all day
Now it's time to turn up, yeah I know you feel the same
Baby you just wanna go out, just to do little dancing
It's a shame you brought yo man with you, know you feeling kinda antsy

Let me show I got everything paid for
If he got a problem I got way more
She fucking with a boss, I make a name for
And I'mma give her everything she came for

'Til the morning
I'mma do my thing, girl I ain't lying we gon' do this
'Til the morning
Cause you're all I need, I don't need no sleep tonight
'Til the morning
Gon' and tell your friends that I don't get tired
We gon' do this 'til the morning
Oh yeah babe, oh yeah babe, we gon' do it 'til the morning

Party, party and put your glass in the air
If you in love make a toast, take your clothes off, put yo ass in the air
This is the party, party and I know you don't really do this all the time
Got your body on mine and your man over there looking mad as hell

Everything paid for
If he got a problem I got way more
She fucking with a boss, I make a name for
And I'mma give her everything she came for

'Til the morning
I'mma do my thing, girl I ain't lying we gon' do this
'Til the morning
Cause you're all I need, I don't need no sleep tonight
'Til the morning
Gon' and tell your friends that I don't get tired
We gon' do this 'til the morning
Oh yeah babe, oh yeah babe, we gon' do it 'til the morning

Okay, I got your nigga grilling me the hardest
I'mma eat the pussy girl regardless
I stay down South like I'm from New-Orleans
Spray up on them walls and them drawers like an artist
I got that long dick, nigga legendary
Where you get that ass from? Bet that it's hereditary
Pussy numb, speaking in tongues, changing your vocabulary
Calling me her Valentine, it ain't even February
I got the antidote
I leave the condoms on the bed so her man'll know
I know he mad cause I'm busting on your cantaloupes
It's horses on the 'Rari but I'm checking camel toe
Look, no sleep baby we gon' pull an all-nighter
I got the weed and the liquor, girl just bring a lighter
You gon' sing baby I'mma have you moaning
It's just a warning, I'm performing

'Til the morning
I'mma do my thing, girl I ain't lying we gon' do this
'Til the morning
Cause you're all I need, I don't need no sleep tonight
'Til the morning
Gon' and tell your friends that I don't get tired
We gon' do this 'til the morning
Oh yeah babe, oh yeah babe, we gon' do it 'til the morning
