Lyrics:


I'm coming home I've done my time,
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine,
If you receive my letter tellin' you I'd soon be free,
Then you'll know just what to do, if you still want me, if you still want me.
Tie a yellow ribbon `round the ole oak tree,
It's been three long years, do ya still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon ,round the ole oak tree,
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a ribbon `round the ole oak tree.
Bus driver, please look for me `cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see,
I'm really still in prison, and my love, she holds the key,
Simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free.
I wrote and told her please tie a yellow ribbon `round the ole oak tree,
It's been three long years, do ya still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon `round the ole oak tree,
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me,
If I don't see a ribbon `round the ole oak tree.
Now the whole damn bus is cheering and I can't believe I see
A hundred yellow ribbons `round the ole oak tree.
