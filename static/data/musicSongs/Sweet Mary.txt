Lyrics:


Hey sweet Mary, where ya goin' today
Could you take it with you, do you know the way, yeah
Hey sweet Mary, watcha got on your mind
Here's your ticket to your heart, don't leave it behind, no

It doesn't mean what you think it does
It never did, 'cause it never was
Sweet Mary, I hope you find what you're lookin' for today

Hey sweet Mary, what your tryin' to say
Doesn't mean a thing to me, 'cause you're leavin' today, yeah
Hey sweet Mary, whatcha tryin' to find
Can you get it together, and make up your mind, yeah

It doesn't mean what you think it does
It never did, 'cause it never was
Sweet Mary, I hope you find what you're lookin' for today

Hey sweet Mary, where ya goin' today
Will you take it with you, do you know the way, yeah
Hey sweet Mary, watcha got on your mind
Here's your ticket to your heart, don't leave it behind, no

It doesn't mean what you think it does
It never did, 'cause it never was
Sweet Mary, I hope you find what you're lookin' for today
