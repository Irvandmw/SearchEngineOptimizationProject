Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Fell in love with a poet
And the songs he sang made life so warm and fine
Loving him was all I did
And he filled my soul with sweet songs all the time

He sang of places where we'd been
Of truth, and love, and me
Then one day he wrote a song
That talked of being free

And he was gone
But the songs he sang for me made love live on
And he was gone
But the songs he sang for me made love live on

Never sure what made him go
Guess the poet has a restless kind of mind
Searching all around the sun
For a peace and truth that many never find

He sang of places where we'd been
Of truth, and love, and me
Then one day he wrote a song
That talked of being free

And he was gone
But the songs he sang for me made love live on
And he was gone
But the songs he sang for me made love live on

And he was gone
