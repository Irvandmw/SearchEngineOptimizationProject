Lyrics:


[Babyface:]
I can't believe all my dreams were answered
Girl I've never been so much inlove
I can't believe this is really happening
'Cause this is what dreams are made of'

[Toni:]
I can't believe you feel the way that I do
There's nothing in the world I want more
Cause being by your side feels my heart with so much joy
I wanna thank you boy, cause my life is all I adore

[Chorus]
[Toni:]
Cause when I look into your eyes I see my future
I've been waiting for this moment all my life

[Babyface:]
Well one day your day will come
When you will take my hand and we will breath as one

[Both:]
Cause when look into your eyes I see my future

[Toni:]
Cause I've been waiting for this moment all my life

Well finally our day has come and you will take my hand and we will breath as one

We will live and breath as one...
