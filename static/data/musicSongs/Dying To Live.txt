Lyrics:


Tell me this, would you miss it
Trying on another face again to see if it's you?
And wondering where you've been
And where you're gonna find yourself before the night is through

I know the way you go, 'cause I've been the same for too long
Like I'm fearful that my choices are all wrong
I know the way you go, 'cause I've lived your life of make believe
Dying to live, dying to live, dying to live

Tell me this, is it lonely
In the shadows of a masquerade for life you hide behind?
What's the deal with your reasons
To run away and let your feelings leave you undefined?

I know the way you go, 'cause I've been the same for too long
Like I'm fearful that my choices are all wrong
I know the way you go, 'cause I've lived your live of make believe
Dying to live, oh

I know the way you go, 'cause I've been the same for too long
Like I'm fearful that my choices are all wrong
I know the way you go, 'cause I've lived your life of make believe
Dying to live, dying to live, dying to live

Behind me now the winding road they sing of
I've come to stand before a silent wall
Finally a chance to find a question
To point out the right answer after all this time

So rid us of the plight
The plight of self affliction
Generations choice
The drug of self deception

I know the way you go, 'cause I've been the same for too long
Like I'm fearful that my choices are all wrong
I know the way you go, 'cause I've lived your life of make believe
Dying to live, oh

I know the way you go, 'cause I've been the same for too long
Like I'm fearful that my choices are all wrong
I know the way you go, 'cause I've lived your life of make believe
Dying to live, dying to live, dying to live
