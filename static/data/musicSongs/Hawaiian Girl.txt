Lyrics:


Way out in the Pacific
Up in Hawi Town
I got lost in your eyes
And your skin of golden brown
Dancin' by the ocean
In your grass skirt and your lei
My Hawaiian Girl
Aloha Wau Ia Oe

My Hawaiian girl, my Hawaiian girl
You're the sunshine of my day
You always bring a smile to my face
I'm happy in every way
My Hawaiian girl, a Polynesian pearl
All I wanna say
Is I love you
Aloha Wau Ia Oe

When I dream late at night
I don't go very far
I'm walking with you, hand in hand
On the beach at Kauna'oa
Everything is perfect
Hangin' loose as the palm trees sway
My Hawaiian girl
Aloha Wau Ia Oe

My Hawaiian girl, my Hawaiian girl
You're the sunshine of my day
You always bring a smile to my face
I'm happy in every way
My Hawaiian girl, a Polynesian pearl
All I wanna say
Is I love you
Aloha Wau Ia Oe

When I came to Hawaii
I took a stroll down by the sea
I found a Polynesian pearl
That's my Hawaiian girl

My Hawaiian girl, my Hawaiian girl
You're the sunshine of my day
You always bring a smile to my face
I'm happy in every way
My Hawaiian girl, a Polynesian pearl
All I wanna say
Is I love you
Aloha Wau Ia Oe
My Hawaiian girl
Aloha Wau Ia Oe
