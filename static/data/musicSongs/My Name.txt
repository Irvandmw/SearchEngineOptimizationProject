Lyrics:


A [?] in love isn't always howl
I wanted to be but I'm here right now
You got to believe that I'm here to stay
If you want me to go, I'll leave this way

Feeling me up while I'm sinking down
It's better this way, you can watch me drown
Here in my voice where there's no sound
Stuck in your head
But you don't know what's going down

I'll be like I am alive, open arms, open eyes
I'll hear your voice through the crowd
I can hear you screaming out my name
My name, my name, my name

Dreaming in love isn't always howl
And you wanted to be but you can't be now
You're in it, for good and you cannot wait
She showed you what taste that your mind can't take

Feeling me up while I'm sinking down
It's better this way, you can watch me drown
Here in my voice where there's no sound
I'm stuck in your head
But you don't know what's going down

I'll be like I am alive, open arms, open eyes
I'll hear your voice through the crowd
I can hear you screaming out my name
My name, my name, my name

I'll be like I am alive, open arms, open eyes
I'll hear your voice through the crowd
I can hear you screaming out my name
My name, my name, my name
(It's out now...)
