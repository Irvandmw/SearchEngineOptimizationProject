Lyrics:


Look out now here she comes, without a glimpse or warnin'
Look out now here she comes, Suzanne on a Sunday morning
Suzanne on a Sunday morning, don't you look just fine
Suzanne on a Sunday morning, can't get her outta my mind

If you like a Monday girl, or Tuesday just the same
You can take your weekday girls, to me they look so plain
Ah, but when the weekend rolls around
Someone ya gotta see, that's

Suzanne on a Sunday morning, don't you look just fine
Suzanne on a Sunday morning, can't get her outta my mind

Well the weekdays, aw the weekdays, Suzy likes to play
If you saw her Sunday you would wish it was everyday
'Cause Suzy is a Sunday child, sure you will agree, yeah

Suzanne on a Sunday morning, don't you look just fine
Suzanne on a Sunday morning, can't get her outta my mind

Look out now here she comes, without a glimpse or warnin'
Look out now here she comes, Suzanne on a Sunday morning
Look out now here she comes, without a glimpse or warnin'
Look out now here she comes, Suzanne on a Sunday morning
Look out now here she comes, without a glimpse or warnin'
Look out now here she comes, Suzanne on a Sunday morning
Look out now here she comes, without a glimpse or warnin'
Look out now here she comes, Suzanne on a Sunday morning
