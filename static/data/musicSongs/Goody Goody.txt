Lyrics:


(Hey, Got Yourself A Good Thing, It's A Good Thing
It's A Good Thing, Got Yourself A Good Thing
I Won't Let You Go.)

So You Met Someone Who Set You Back On Your Heels,
Goody Goody!
So You Met Someone And Now You Know How It Feels,
Goody Goody!
So You Gave Him Your Heart Too, Just As I Gave Mine To You.
And He Broke It In Little Pieces, Now How Do You Do?

So You Lie Awake Just Singin' The Blues All Night,
Goody Goody!
So You Think That Love's A Barrel Of Dynamite.
Hooray And Hallelujah!
You Had It Comin' To Ya.
Goody Goody For Him, Goody Goody For Me,
And I Hope You're Satisfied, You Rascal You.

(Good Thing, Got Yourself A Good Thing
It's A Good Thing, Got Yourself A Good Thing
I Won't Let You Go.)

So You Met Someone Who Set You Back On Your Heels,
Goody Goody!
So You Met Somebody And Now You Know How It Feels,
Goody Goody!
So You Gave Him Your Heart Too Just As I Gave Mine To You.
And He Stuck It In His Collection, Section Ninety-Two.

So You Lie Awake Just Singin' The Blues All Night,
So You Think That Love's A Barrel Of Dynamite.
Hooray And Hallelujah!
You Had It Comin' To Ya.
Goody Goody For Him, Goody Goody For Me,
And I Hope You're Satisfied, You Rascal You.
