Lyrics:
Lyrics:


A man finds a bottle on the bottom shelf
Forgotten and covered in dust
The label is already half worn off
Still, open it up he must.

As the corkscrew into the cork it goes
He hears the weird refrain,
âDo you what you like, but never uncork
Uncork what you canât contain
Do what you like but never uncork
Uncork what you canât contain.â

Pandora had a pretty little box,
Wisely she kept it hid
Until one day she couldnât resist
Playing around with the lid
As the demons flew and the shadows grew
This song went around her brain:

âYou can do what you like but never uncork
Uncork what you canât contain,
You can do what you like but never uncork
Uncork what you canât contain.â

As the demons flew and the shadows grew
This song went around her brain:
âYou can do what you like but never uncork
Uncork what you canât contain.â

Macklemore went to the thrift shop
Looking to pop some tags
Found an ancient oil lamp
Hidden among the rags
So he picked it up and he rubbed it down
Thought heâd gone insane

Cause a genie flew out, singing âNever uncork
Uncork what you canât containâ
Genie flew out, singing âNever uncork
Uncork what you canât containâ

He picked it up and he rubbed it down
Thought heâd gone insane
Cause the genie flew out singing âNever uncork
Uncork what you canât contain.â
But sometimes though you have to
Let out what youâre keeping inside
If you keep it all in, your head will spin
And your mouth is all tongue tied

Youâve got to find the way to say what you say
And get it down on the page
Or the stage
Itâs the cage for that tiger rage that you canât contain

Yes the page and the stage is the cage for that tiger rage
That you canât contain, for real
The page and the stage is the cage
For that tiger rage, what it is that you feel
So, do what you like but you better uncork
Uncork what you canât contain
Do what you like but you better uncork
Uncork what you canât contain

Cause the page and the stage is the cage
For that tiger rage thatâll cause you pain
Do what you like but you better uncork
Uncork what you canât contain
