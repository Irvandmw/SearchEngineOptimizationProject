Lyrics:


It's time to hit the trail
(It's time to hit the trail and and and...)
It's time to hit the lofty trail
(It's time to hit the lofty trail)
(Bum bum bum bum bum bum...)
I never liked to travel by automobile or bike
The only way to travel along is travel along the way you like and as for me I like I like-a to hike
(He likes to hike he likes to hike he hates to pedal a bike)

It's time to climb the peak
(It's time to climb the peak)
The dawn breaks through the sky
Again you'll hear the cry
(Again you hear again you hear from the man you hear a cry)

I've climbed a lot of mountain peaks including the peak of Pike
The peak of Pike was a heck of a hike but I'll never never never rest until I conquer Everest
(Ever-Ever-Ever-Everest until we conquer Ever-Ever-Everest)
(We like to hike)
(We like to hike)
(We like to hike)
(We like to hike)

We like to hike
