Lyrics:


Shot, shot
Gun
Shot, shot
Gun
Gun

You wouldn't mind taking time out
You got good energy like a 5-Hour
Tell me what you like, I'ma tie it down
I bring you in, never steer you out

Baby pop somethin'
Baby they can't stop nothin'
You wanna ride with me, shotgun
You wanna slide with me, shotgun
Baby, pop somethin'
Go up and down like you dropped somethin'
You wanna ride with me, shotgun
Shotgun

Rainin' hunnids like they all ones
Your purse too full, girl you dropped somethin' (Gun)
You off that pink molly girl, pop somethin'
Ridin' sideways like we gon' chop somethin'
Got a crystal pool, got a MAC 11
Got a chef that's whippin' up lobster spaghetti
Shouldn't of said,"Pop it, pop it girl" they got all jealous
I aint talkin' to your girl, I'm makin' that a promise

Baby pop somethin'
Baby they can't stop nothin'
You wanna ride with me, shotgun
You wanna slide with me, shotgun

Baby pop somethin' (Wanna pop somethin')
Go up and down like you dropped somethin'
You wanna ride with me, shotgun
Shotgun

Rainin' hunnids like they all ones
Your purse so full you dropped somethin'
'Bout to go to the dealer, and cop somethin'
New wheels on the 'Rari with your top down
Ten thousand feet up we get wifi
Swap the diamonds out like a montage
We land the chopper on front of the yacht
The white g-strings show ass shots
My brother Detail live like Ashton
We in the matrix we gon' rewind time
Thirty foot ceilings in my glass house
You coulda quit but you ain't give up on me, you stayed down

Baby pop somethin'
Baby they can't stop nothin'
You wanna ride with me, shotgun
You wanna slide with me, shotgun

Baby pop somethin
Go up and down like you dropped somethin'
You wanna ride with me, shotgun
Shotgun

I'ma pop up, tell me where the fuck you at
You get upset you do some shit you gon' regret
It was dark, it was late, you were gone
Don't leave me alone in the dark thinkin' 'bout you

Ridin' shotgun, under the AC blow through your hair
I secured this bag, already ain't got no care
Tell the bitches get off your dick, girl it ain't fair
Let's go flawless shopping, girl this shit is rare

Baby pop somethin'
Baby they can't stop nothin'
You wanna ride with me, shotgun
You wanna slide with me, shotgun
Baby pop somethin'
Go up and down like you dropped somethin'
You wanna ride with me, shotgun
Shotgun, shotgun
