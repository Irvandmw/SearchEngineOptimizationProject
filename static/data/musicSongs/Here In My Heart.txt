Lyrics:


I keep on thinking I should be free 
This time just sleepin' alone 
With 17 reasons not to believe 
Nothing goes everybody knows 
Like you always wanted to be

But here in my heart there's a dream that's unbroken 
And it gets in my way, but it won't be denied 
Here in my heart the door is still open 
Waiting for you to walk into my life

What I've been feeling I can't explain 
Lost in the blues of your eyes 
And I'm falling so hard just like the rain
Comes a time when you cross the line 
And you know you got to believe

'Cause here in my heart there's a dream that's unbroken 
And it gets in my way but it won't be denied 
Here in my heart the door is still open 
Waiting for you to walk into my life

I know I may never sleep again 
Till I see you oh baby I know 
I know life is too short and I can't pretend 
It's not about you can't do without you 
(Not about you)

But here in my heart there's a dream that's unbroken 
And it gets in my way but it won't be denied 
(Gets in my way) 
Here in my heart the door is still open 
(Here in my heart)
Waiting for you to walk into my life

There's a dream that's unbroken 
It gets in my way but it won't be denied 
Here in my heart the door is still open 
(Here in my heart) 
Waiting for you to walk into my life

In my life
(In my life) 
In my life 
(In my life).
