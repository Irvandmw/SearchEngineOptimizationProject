Lyrics:


Ooh, this is a story 'bout Mary and Joe
Two young lovers from long ago
Just a small-town romance that you might know
Joe and Mary, Mary and Joe

A rumor got started, or so they say
That Joe got Mary in a family way
Neighbors started talkin', the word got around
Joe said, "Mary, gotta blow this town"

Oh, Joe and Mary, Mary and Joe
In a beat up Buick on the open road
Chuck Berry playin' on the radio
Joe and Mary, Mary and Joe

Joe said, "Mary, just a few more miles
You can make it, baby, just gimme a smile
I can see Bethlehem up ahead
They got a buffet breakfast and a motel bed"

Yeah, Joe and Mary, Mary and Joe
Lookin' for a place where they can go
The heater went out, it was twenty below
Joe and Mary, Mary and Joe

Well, they're all filled up at the Motel 6
Joe said, "Man, we're in a hell of a fix
But don't you worry, baby, it'll be alright
There's angels up in heaven lookin' down tonight"
That's right

Oh, Joe and Mary, Mary and Joe
And a pretty little baby in swaddlin' clothes
Star in the east cast a heavenly glow
Over Joe and Mary, Mary and Joe

Yeah, wouldn't be long before the world would know
About Joe and Mary, Mary and Joe
Oh, yeah

Joe and Mary
Joe and Mary
Joe and Mary
Joe and Mary
Oh, Mary and Joe

Joe and Mary
Joe and Mary
Joe and Mary
Joe and Mary
Oh, Mary and Joe

It wouldn't be long before the world would know
