Lyrics:


Tell me, tell me, tell me where to go go go
Tell me, tell me...

Tell me where to go, 'cause I'm lost and I can't find my way
Tell me how to act with all the hate you see today
I gotta know, how can I fix this mess, yeah, the mess that I made?
To turn it all around tell me is there a way?

How can I just leave? Yeah, I'm a fool to believe
That everything would turn out right for me so please
Please, tell me...

Tell me where to go, yes, I gotta know, help me escape this night
Tell me where to go, help me find my home, this feeling don't feel right
Tell me, tell me, tell me where to go go go
Tell me, tell me, I gotta find home...

Now I admit everything I've done so can you forgive can you be the one
To help me find my way back home? And teach me everything you know
Can you hear my words or even the metronome?

How can I just leave? I was a fool to believe
That everything will turn out right for me so please
Please tell me, oh woah

Tell me where to go, yes, I gotta know, help me escape this night
Tell me where to go, help me find my home, this feeling don't feel right
Tell me, tell me, tell me where to go go go
Tell me, tell me, cause I gotta find home

Can you help me, can you help me, can you help me find my home?
Can you help me, can you help me, can you help me find my home?
Can you help me, can you help me, can you help me find my home?

Tell me where to go, yes, I gotta know, help me escape this night
Tell me where to go, help me find my home...
Tell me where to go, yes, I gotta know, help me escape this night
Tell me where to go, help me find my home, this feeling don't feel right
Tell me, tell me, tell me where to go go go
Tell me, tell me, cause I gotta find home
