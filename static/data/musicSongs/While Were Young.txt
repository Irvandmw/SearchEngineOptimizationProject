Lyrics:


Songs were made to sing, 
While we're young! 
Every day is Spring, 
While we're young! 

None can refuse, 
Time flies so fast! 
Too dear to lose, 
An' too sweet to last! 

Though it may be just... 
For today! 
Share our love we must... 
While we may! 

So blue the skies, 
All sweet surprise, 
Shines before our eyes, 
While we're young! 

(None can refuse, 
Time flies so fast! 
Too dear to lose, 
An' too sweet to last!) 

Though it may be just... 
For today! 
Share our love we must... 
While we may! 

So blue the skies, 
All sweet surprise, 
Shines before our eyes, 
While we're young!
