Lyrics:


So take me way back â back in the day
My father was a fuck up â absolutely insane 
He walked out the door â straight out of my life
He stole my innocence â like a thief in the night
I had a handful of cards â stacked against me 
Mama's blacked out â I couldn't tell if she loved me 
I gave up cause I didn't have a family
I fell hard with nobody there to catch me
Somebody catch me 

Fear â I'm hopeless
Hate â I'm helpless
Love â I'm powerless
I gotta get out of this
Fear â No choice in
Hate â This crisis
Love â It's heartless
I'm so sick of this 
Why did you abandon me? 
How could you just walk away?
Fear â I'm hopeless
Hate â I'm helpless
Love â I'm powerless
I gotta get out of this

Now I'm out here â walking the streets
I'm a fatherless child â I'm a social disease
There's no love living in a broken home
I never ever thought I'd have to live it alone
Then I talked to God â said I was empty
How could anybody ever possibly love me?
I know that it hurts at the minute
It'll drag you to hell if you let it 
Drag you to hell if you let it 

Fear â I'm hopeless
Hate â I'm helpless
Love â I'm powerless
I gotta get out of this
Fear â No choice in
Hate â This crisis
Love â It's heartless
I'm so sick of this 
Why did you abandon me ? 
How could you just walk away ?
Fear â I'm hopeless
Hate â I'm helpless
Love â I'm powerless
I gotta get out of this

I've lost my innocence
You've tried to take my hope
You've tried to take me down
I found myself again
No you can't take my heart 
No you can't take me down
Cause karma comes around 

Fear â I'm hopeless
Hate â I'm helpless
Love â I'm powerless
I gotta get out of this
Fear â No choice in
Hate â This crisis
Love â It's heartless
I'm so sick of this 
Why did you abandon me ? 
How could you just walk away ?
Fear â I'm hopeless
Hate â I'm helpless
Love â I'm powerless
I gotta get out of this

Fear 
Hate 
Love
