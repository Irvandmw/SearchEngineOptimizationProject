Lyrics:


Yeah...
Bitch you know I keep them Ks with me
And I ain't pussy boy don't play with me
She give me head like wavy grease
While I pull up in a Jeep like a ATV
Feelin' like Kevin Gates, I got six [?]
Bitch I whip it till my motherfuckin' wrist tired
I only have a deuce it make me lean back
Young nigga flexin' hunnids they ain't seen that
Young niggas talkin' money I ain't seen that
Livin' lavish while these other niggas dream that
You talkin' bitch but I don't need your feedback
Bitch, I ain't tryna marry, get my ring back
Bitch get back I don't play shit
Big rack stash in the basement
I'm tryna do the dash, get out the way bitch
Nigga talk shit, get a face lift

I gotta put a Magnum on when I hit it
She hit me on the track phone, bitch quit it
I text her back like I ain't seen that pussy in a minute
So please don't call my phone if it ain't about them digits
(Baby don't call my phone, bitch, I don't wanna talk to you)
Why? 'Cause
I just want the money, money, money, money, money, money, money nigga
I just want the money, money, money, money, money, money, money nigga
I just want the money, money, money, money, money, money, money nigga
I just want the money, money, money, money, money, money, money nigga

Don't make me throw these hunnids in your face nigga
Have him singing to his lady like he Drake nigga
'Cause I always keep the forty on my waist nigga
And the Roley got the bullets in the face nigga
I was off now I'm on nigga
I was off and now I'm on motherfucker
Yeah, so don't mistake me for the wrong nigga
Put a Percy in the Sprite, they make me lean, yeah
My niggas always keep the 30 with the bean, yeah
We rich bitch so she goin' for the team, yeah
'Cause these bitches showed the pinky for the green yeah
Young niggas ain't even touch the racks out here doing these bitches
Young niggas and he touch the racks out here doing these bitches
Young niggas and he touch the racks out here doing these bitches
You better watch what you say nigga
I go from Compton to the D to the A nigga

I gotta put a Magnum on when I hit it
She hit me on the track phone, bitch quit it
I text her back like I ain't seen that pussy in a minute
So please don't call my phone if it ain't about them digits
(Baby don't call my phone, bitch, I don't wanna talk to you)
