Lyrics:


Standin' on the rooftop
Just out of earshot
Lookin' at this gangster guy

Thinkin' he's a hot shot
Pourin me a big shot
Tryin' to get me drunk and high

He wishes to be seen with me in his limousine
And he says, "We'll have a real good time"
Well, xxo, but I want you to know

Every single night, in the lights I'll be sparklin' bright
I'm just a party girl, tryin' to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright, let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warnin' you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on this play
Bringin' New York down to St Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partyin' all night, I'm gonna make it pop

Kissin' on your white yacht
Show me what you got got
Play a little rock n' roll
On an island hop stop, maybe we should dot dot dot
(lose control)

Do you think it's really mean that I'm only on the scene
'Cause I want a little danger boy?
Well, xxo, but I told you so

Every single night, in the lights I'll be sparklin' bright
I'm just a party girl, tryin' to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright, let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warnin' you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on this play
Bringin' New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partyin' all night, I'm gonna make it pop

It's not about us, just forget about us
Tonight
Put your cigarette down, baby, light up the town
Beside me

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on this play
Bringin' New York down to St Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partyin' all night, I'm gonna make it pop
