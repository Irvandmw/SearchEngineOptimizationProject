[Hook:]
And I can't go nowhere without you...
You make me so dizzy
Spinning feelings inside
Shining heart is spinning for you
When I see you you know I get dizzy

Damn, you be making me hot though
Spin this little nigga tryna touch legato
Tryna make cheese like Louise is natural
Nigga making my ass go into my cargo
Your lame main chick is a thot tho
I'm kinda Busch or I'm kinda Picasso
Picking up the fruit bitch gimme the box yo
I'm a smooth little kitty if you really did not know
And I'm under the influence
Shaking your business
Swaying my hips to this
Ya, I'm getting it in (it in)
Breaking their neck like they go to gym (the gym)
It's you that I'm going but I really ain't into him
What the fuck is your Instagram?
I don't fuck with your image ,man
Baby Boy is you listening? (What?)

[Hook]

And it feels alright
Don't leave me off your side
Can't even question why
Something I just won't fight
So lose yourself in the groove~
Yeah, I'll make your wishes come true~
When we move, I don't really know how you make me do what I do
One shot and I'm so blue
Baby I'm stuck to you

[Hook]
