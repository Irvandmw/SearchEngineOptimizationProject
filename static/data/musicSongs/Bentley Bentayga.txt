Lyrics:


I was broke before don't give a fuck now (guess what?)
I got all this Alianci bust down now
Now I make 100 on a bad day, yeah
Now I make 100 on a bad day, yeah
Now I see these niggas tryna ride waves, yeah
Now I see these bitches and they sad faced, yes
But they used to never write me back, ayy-yeah
Run up on me get hit with the tech, ayy

Skeleton, AP me and my bros, thatâs a bust down
I don't like new niggas on the road, I'm from up town
Everywhere I go they be like goals, Iâma icon
Twistin' on my feet and my new shoes I'm like Mike, ahh
Now which one of these weapons should I choose with the spikes on?
I watch all of my diamonds glitter blue when the lights off
I might go cop another watch and then go shit on my haters
They don't wanna take it 'cause they know shit could get dangerous
[?] lost like 50K before I even been to Vegas
I go 180 on the freeway
I'm in the Bentley with Bentayga

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo
Yeah, yeah

If one of my niggas get then go get that nigga
Don't you bring your ass to Highbridge until you get that nigga
I don't wanna promote violence, but go kill that nigga
I donât wanna promote violence, but go kill that nigga
The Effen go right through you, you donât wanna be next to that nigga
Dressed in [?] I might be the freshest in it nigga
They love how I switch my damn flows on pianos
They think they can fuckin' send shots, they need ammo
I feel like a fuckinâ rockstar, I don't dance though
I don't wanna play with Glocks nah, let's go rambo
I ainât worried about no cop car, you're too damn slow
I ain't worried about no opp nah, let his man's know

Now I got a Bentayga
Ah, ah, ah, ah, [?] thousand Bentayga
Ah, ah, ah, ah, Bentley Bentayga
Ah, ah, ah, ah, the fuck is they saying
Ah, ah, ah, ah, the fuck is they saying
Ah, ah, ah, ah, the fuck is they saying
Ah, ah, ooh, yeah
Ah, ah, ooh, yeah
Ah, ah, ooh, yeah
Ah, ah, ooh, yeah
Ah, ah, the fuck is they saying
Ay, the fuck is they saying, yeah, yeah
