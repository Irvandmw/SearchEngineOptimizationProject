[6ix9ine:]
Front line, back line, side to side
You want it? You can get it, we can do this all night
We can do this, Rosa, don't tell your mani
You know I'm Gotti, with the Mulignane
I'm on yo' body, don't tell nobody
Bitch, don't be cocky, I'm on your body
I got this Henny in my cup, I just wanna make love
Don't tell your boyfriend (nah), he don't know nothing

Baby, I don't really wanna fight right now
I just really want you on top right now
Why you really wanna run your mouth right now?
I just really want top right now, yeah

So move it closer (Move it closer)
Let me control 'ya (Let me control 'ya)
Just let me hold 'ya (Just let me hold 'ya)
'Till this beat gets over ('Til the beat gets over)

[Lil AK:]
I been sippin' Henny all night
And it got me feeling alright
Henny real nice, got it on ice
Beat the pussy pretty, all night
Fuck around and make you my wife
Change your life, I can really change your life
Put you in a brand new ride, heels real high
Girl, them Hollywood hills high
Put you on a private flight (Aye!)
I could put you in the sky
I could get ya real high
Put you on a private flight
No more Spirit Airlines
I like the way you move your hips
Down to the way you bite your lips
I got the Henny in my cup, you know I don't give a fuck
Don't tell your boyfriend that I'm still fuckin'

[6ix9ine:]
Baby, I don't really wanna fight right now
I just really want you on top right now
Why you really wanna run your mouth right now?
I just really want top right now, yeah

So move it closer (Move it closer)
Let me control 'ya (Let me control 'ya)
Just let me hold 'ya (Just let me hold 'ya)
'Till this beat gets over ('Til the beat gets over)
