Lyrics:


I can see clearly now the rain has gone.
I can see all obstacles in my way.
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind.
It's gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day.
It's gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day.

I think I can make it now the pain is gone.
All of the bad feelings have disappeared.
You are the rainbow I've been waiting for.
You make it a bright bright sunshiny day.
It's gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day.

Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies.
Just look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies.

I can see clearly now the rain is gone.
I can see all obstacles in my way.
And you are the rainbow I've been waiting for.
You make it a bright bright sunshiny day.
It's gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day.
