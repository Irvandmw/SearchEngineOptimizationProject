[Chorus:]
Shawty Iâmma only tell you this once, girl I need it (toniiight) 
When I do it to you, Iâmma do you right please believe it 
All night long (Baby, right now) 
Will you lay in my arms? 
Cause it ainât nothinâ like 
Your love (Girl I want your love) 
Your love (Girl I need your love) 
Your love, your love 
Itâs your lo-o-o-o-o-oooove 
And when you give me a kiss, I give it right back 
Lickinâ your lips, do it like that (Baby) 

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, five five, lookinâ real fine 
Got me like the sun, girl look at me rise 
Hot lilâ thang, up in my ride 
Iâm hard as hell, I ainât gonâ lie (ainât gonâ lie) 
Shawty bad, know she a keeper 
But shawty did some things I ainât even seen before 
And shawty turned me into a believer 
I can do whatever, long as I donât mess her weave up 
What my name is? Go on, scream it, when Iâm all in that thang shawty 
Cause we been playinâ this game all day 
And Iâm ready to go all the way 
And Iâmma do it like aw, sookie sookie nah 
And we can roll play, girl give it to me now 
Iâm giving you a massage, your booty like Nicki Minaj (Oh gosh) 

[Chorus:]
Shawty Iâmma only tell you this once, girl I need it (toniiight) 
When I do it to you, Iâmma do you right please believe it 
All night long (Baby, right now) 
Will you lay in my arms? 
Cause it ainât nothinâ like 
Your love (Girl I want your love) 
Your love (Girl I need your love) 
Your love, your love 
Itâs your lo-o-o-o-o-oooove (Yeaaaah, yeah) 
And when you give me a kiss, I give it right back 
Lickinâ your lips, do it like that (Baby) 

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, let me step up to the plate now 
Big kidâs in the room, no playground 
I wanna kiss everything from the waist down 
Keep your ass up, and your face down 
Oh girl, lovinâ the way you do it 
Freakinâ me to the music, keep a hat on like Iâm Jewish 
HA! They be like âChris you foolishâ 
Uh uh, what you take me for, a groupie? 
Nah. Just wanna get you to my sex room 
And do my sh*t, and I donât mean restroom 
First class, takinâ bubble baths 
Tell her throw it in the bag like she takinâ out the trash 
Yeah, now let me see what you about now 
If you official with this sh*t, Iâmma bow down 
Iâmma eat it up, yeah, Iâmma chow down 
Sayinâ all type of sh*t like WOW! DAMN! 

[Chorus:]
Shawty Iâmma only tell you this once, girl I need it (toniiight) 
When I do it to you, Iâmma do you right please believe it 
All night long (Baby, right now) 
Will you lay in my arms? 
Cause it ainât nothinâ like 
Your love (Girl I want your love) 
Your love (Girl I need your love) 
Your love, your love 
Itâs your lo-o-o-o-o-oooove (Yeaaaah, yeah) 
And when you give me a kiss, I give it right back 
Lickinâ your lips, do it like that (Baby) 
Shawty, youâre the illest (ooohhhh) 
Yeah, oh ohh 
Your love, your love
