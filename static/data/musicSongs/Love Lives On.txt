Lyrics:


On a snowy windy morning in a plane crash in the mountains 
You and seven other soldiers said goodbyeâ¨
We shared five years together and that wasn't long enough 
But I swear they were the best years of my life
And on the days your memory is tearing at my heart 
You always find a way to let me know we're not apart

Love lives on - every day every nightâ¨
In our hearts in our minds like and old classic song 
Love lives on - where we work where we liveâ¨
In the eyes of our kids and every picture on the wall 
I can still feel you with me even though you are gone 
Love lives on, love lives on

They were Fathers they were mothers, some were sisters and brothers 
Wife's, husbands daughters and sons
â¨Different towns different stories different faces different namesâ¨
But the bond we share will never come undone

We're there for each other through the tears and the pain 
And though the grief we share together never goes away

Love lives on - every day every night
â¨In our hearts in our minds like and old classic song 
Love lives on - where we work where we live
â¨In the eyes of our kids and every picture on the wall 
I can still feel you with me even though you are gone 
Love lives on, Love lives on

Through your sacrifice 
In all you left behind 
You give us strength to carry on

Love lives on - every day every night
â¨In our hearts in our minds like and old classic song 
Love lives on - where we work where we live
â¨In the eyes of our kids and every picture on the wall 
Love lives on - where we work where we live
â¨In the eyes of our kids and every picture on the wall 

Through your sacrifice 
In all you left behind 
You give us strength to carry on

Love lives on
