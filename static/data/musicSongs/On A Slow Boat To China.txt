Song Name: On A Slow Boat To China
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Well there's no verse to this song
'Cause I don't want to wait a moment too long
To say that I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China
All myself alone
To get you to keep you in my arms evermore
Leave all your lovers weeping on the far-away shore

Well out on the briny with a moon big and shiny
Melting your heart of stone
Well I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China
All to myself alone

Well I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China
All to myself alone
On a real slow boat
On a slow slow boat to China

On An Evening In Roma (Sott'er Celo De Roma)
Como e` bella ce` la luna brille e` strette
strette como e` tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma

Though there's grining and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and that's one too few
On an evening in Roma

Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evening in Roma

Como e` bella ce` la luna brille e` strette
strette como e` tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma
Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evening in Roma
Sott'er celo de Roma
On an evening in Roma
