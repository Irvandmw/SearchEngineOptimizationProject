Song Name: Inside Of Me
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The point on the water, there's a change in the air,
A vibe in the darkness but there's nobody there.
I look for the reason but there's nothing to see,
Just a hole in my memory where my mind used to be.

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
Can I find no relief in my heart.
I reside
In a world that has fallen apart.
Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby,
Show me a way to get back on time, please.
Where do we go, baby, how will I know?
Who holds the key, is it hidden inside of me?

But why should I worry and why do I care
When this road that I walk on is going nowhere.
I stand and I study every face in the crowd,
See the fear in their eyes, they must be thinking out loud.

[Chorus]

Scratching the surface, it all looks the same;
A world full of anger with no one to blame.
But who can I turn to? Who holds the key?
And who has the answer? I think it's inside of me.

[Chorus 2x]
