Lyrics:


I know I'll do it again
I know we're gonna collide
I know we'll call it the end
It's always always a lie
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I wear my blood on my tie
But it's only love underneath, this disguise

Oh you left, a hole in me
But I don't cut, easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
I think it's time to open up, I don't mean bleed
So turn it on, we can go wild
If it's what you want, fire at me

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night, than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go

Why don't you do it again?
Go wrecking something of mine
Like you deserve the revenge
Like I got something to hide
I keep on playing with you, yeah
You keep on calling me names
Sure I can take the abuse
It's just a game

Oh you left, a hole in me
But I don't cut, easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
I think it's time to open up, I don't mean bleed
So turn it on, we can go wild
If it's what you want, fire at me

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night, than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go

All I know is I love it when our shit blows
We keep turning red
Hot, stone cold, sweet burn inside
Deals get broke we fall in and fall out, we're too close
It's dead love until curtains close
We come alive

I can't bear to let you go, no
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night, than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let, no

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night, than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go
