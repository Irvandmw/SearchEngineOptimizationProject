Lyrics:


For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words
A cage for your own bird?
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving, fuckery of the world?
Why would you offer a name
To the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothin'
And honey, if nothin's gained?

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me
'Cause if secrets were like seeds
Keep my body from the fire
Hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me
And if secrets were like seeds
When I'm lying under marble
Marvel at flowers you'll have made

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the song
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't have hoped to know, but here I stand

There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
