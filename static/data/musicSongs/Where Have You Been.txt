Lyrics:


Yeah
Whenever you sleep
I'm in your dreams

I'm sitting at your front door, wondering where you've been
I'm sitting at your front door where I've been
I've been moving forward
I've been moving forward

I'm sitting at your front door, wondering where you've been
I'm sitting at your front door where I've been
I've been moving forward
I've been moving forward

Where have you been?
Haven't seen you in a bit
Where did you sleep?
I've been, I've been the secrets you keep
So night as two
