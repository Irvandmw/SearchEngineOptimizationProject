Lyrics:


You know the reason you act the way you do
And so do I, and so do I babe
I've seen the little things
You've never shown me to
Why should I cry babe

Had you only heard me calling
From the rainbows nimbo of now
Where you never let me take you
Halfway to some strange power

You can tell the hour that comes
Bringing all that we can borrow
So close your eyes to the hands
Upon the clock
There is no time, no such thing as time babe

You sit so closely to the door
Counting on the knock
There are no signs babe

If you could only see the thousands
Of the days I'm standing in between
All because you hold my hand so tightly
As we both walk and we laugh

We talk all about tomorrow
We laughed about it, tomorrow
We talked about it, tomorrow
We laughed about it, tomorrow
We talked about it, tomorrow
