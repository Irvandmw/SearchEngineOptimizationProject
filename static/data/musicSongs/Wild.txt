Lyrics:


She got a pair of pink and purple high-heel shoes
And a baby doll t-shirt that says "I got issues"
She got holes in her jeans in all the right places
Let's just say she's downright curvaceous

[Chorus]
She's wild...wild...wild as my wildest dreams
Yeah she's wild...if you know what I mean
She's wild as the wild wild west
But here's the part I love the best
That girl only gets wild with me

She loves to drop the top on her red VW
And the truckers looking down they love it too
She blows 'em a kiss just to get their air horns blowin'
Any more than that they'd never get to where they're going

[Repeat Chorus]

Sunday picnic, summer afternoon
Red hot sun, spicy barbeque
Working up a sweat by the riverside
She says let's get wet, it's skinny-dipping time

[Repeat Chorus]

That girl only gets wild with me
