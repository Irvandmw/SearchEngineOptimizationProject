Lyrics:


An old cow poke went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Yippee-i-ay yippee-i-o
The ghost herd in the sky

As the riders looped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on the range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

Yippee-i-a yippee-i-o
The ghost herd in the sky
The ghost herd in the sky
Yippee-i-o
The ghost riders in the sky
