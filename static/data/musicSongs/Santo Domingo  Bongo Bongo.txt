The castinets they get a play
Castinets make you sway
The bongo bingo [JL] Ay-yi bingo
And you'll be king-o [JL] Ay-yi bingo
In San Domingo [JL] Oh bongo bingo
If you know how to sway
You can learn how to play
Just the way that they play in San Domingo
If you beat when you hum
Just repeat it on a drum
And they'll know that you've come to San Domingo

Go where the gang go [JL&CM] .. noise ..
And learn the lingo [JL&CM] .. noise ..
And you fandango [JL&CM] .. noise ..
In San Domingo [JL&CM] .. noise ..
Just bingo bongo [JL&CM] .. noise ..
Just bongo bingo [JL&CM] .. noise ..
And we go king-o [JL&CM] .. noise ..
In San Domingo [CM] Bango
