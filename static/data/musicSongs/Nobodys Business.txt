Lyrics:


[Rihanna:]
You'll always be mine, sing it to the world
Always be my boy, I'll always be your girl
Nobody's business, ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
Mine and my baby
But mine and my baby
But mine and my baby, ooh

[Chris Brown:]
I love to love to love you baby
I love to love to love you baby
Me and you, get it?
Ain't nobody's business
Said it ain't nobody's business

[Rihanna:]
Your love is perfection
Please point me in the right direction
I'mma give you all my affection
Every touch becomes infectious
Let's make out in this Lexus
There's no other love just like this
A life with you I wonder can we become love's persona

You'll always be the one that I wanna come home to
Boy let me love you and show you how special you are
I wanna be your baby, you'll always be my baby
Tell me what you want now

Let's sing it to the world
Baby, give me some
I'mma be your girl
I wanna make you mine
And it ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
Just mine and my baby

[Chris Brown:]
Your love is perfection
Please point me in the right direction
I'mma give you all my affection
Every touch becomes infectious
Let's make out in this Lexus
There's no other love just like this
A life with you I wonder can we become love's persona

You'll always be the one that I wanna come home to
Girl let me love you and show you how special you are
I wanna be your baby, you'll always be my baby
Tell me what you want

Sing it to the world
Baby, give me some
You gon' be my girl
I wanna make you mine
And it ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
Just mine and my baby

Ain't nobody's business
Said it ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
Said it ain't nobody's business

[Rihanna and Chris Brown:]
You'll always be mine, sing it to the world
Always be my boy, you'll always be my girl
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Nobody's business
But mine and my baby
