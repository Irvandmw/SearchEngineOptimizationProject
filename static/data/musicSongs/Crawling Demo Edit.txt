Lyrics:


[Chester Bennington:]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface (beneath the surface)
Consuming (consuming), confusing (confusing)
This lack of self control I find so overwhelming (so overwhelming)
Controlling (controlling), I can't seem

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
To find the strength within
My walls are closing in
(without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

[Chester Bennington:]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has made itself upon me (itself upon me)
Distracting (distracting), reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection (my own reflection)
It's haunting (it's haunting), how I can't seem

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
To find the strength within
My walls are closing in
(without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
To find the strength within
My walls are closing in
I've felt this way before
So insecure

[Chester Bennington:]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
