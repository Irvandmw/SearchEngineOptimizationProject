Lyrics:


You say you'll get over
It
But I know you better
Your feelings have been hurt a bit
And you just can't forget her
You'll want her back by tomorrow
But she won't remember your name
You better

Get lost in the rhythm
Get lost in the rhythm of life
Get lost in the rhythm
Get lost in the rhythm of life

You can't seem to step around

Life's cracks in the sidewalk
You wanna live in the fast lane
But you won't be the driver
You could be waiting a lifetime
Before you make up your mind
You gotta

Get lost in the rhythm
Get lost in the rhythm of life
Get lost in the rhythm
Get lost in the rhythm of life

You say that my soul is lost
And that you're my savior
You'll do anything at any cost
To reform my behavior
Didn't I make it this far
By making up my own mind
You gotta

Get lost in the rhythm
Get lost in the rhythm of life
Get lost in the rhythm
Get lost in the rhythm of life
