Lyrics:


Kiss a little harder, hold me a little tighter
Before we get a little older
Pull me a little closer, take me
A little bit higher, make me

Feel the rush and bloat to my head
Stay up all night, not go to bed
Drive me down the highway
All night long

Before the light changes ohh
Before we, before we grow up
Before we turn into people we don't recognize

Baby let's run the red, like we never did
Show me what all I've been missing
Hold me a little closer, take me
A little bit higher, make me

Feel the rush and bloat to my head
Wanna hear things you never said
Drive me down the highway
All night long

Before the light changes ohh
Before we, before we grow up
Before we turn into people we don't recognize

Before there's nothing left to tell and the mystery is gone
Our hearts can't help to move on
Slow everything down, cuz it's moving too fast
Lie to me, say the feeling's gonna last
I'm looking at you, you're looking at me
The sun is rising, bittersweet
But we can't stop it
Hold on to me now
Hold on to me

Before the light changes ohh
Before we, before we grow up
Before we turn into people we don't recognize
