Lyrics:


The other woman
Has time to manicure her nails
The other woman
Is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls
In her hair
Anywhere

The other woman
Enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman
Keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered
Everywhere

And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine

But

The other woman
Will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman
Will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by
The other woman
Will spend
Her life alone
Alone
Alone
