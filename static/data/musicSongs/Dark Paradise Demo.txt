Lyrics:


I got the ice
You got the fire
I've got the stuff
To take you higher

Ahhh, that's how you played it

I got the brains
You got the money
This is a race
Let's go fast honey

Ahhh, that's how you played it

Come on pretty baby
I'll be takin' you down
They say you got crazy
Like, all over town

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

I got the brains
You got the money
This is a race
Let's go fast honey

Ahhh, that's how you played it

Come on pretty baby
I'll be takin' you down
They say you got crazy
Like, all over town

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight

There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight

Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight
