Lyrics:


How do people find their love?
Love as it was meant to be
We wonder is it fate or gods above?
A crowd of people stand and stare
Oblivious, we come together

The whiplash of this city street
A million people happen by
Graffiti swirling pretty, swirling sweet
Now our world is not the same
But I remember every moment
Ever, ever

Long ago and faraway
Eyes so deep, we kiss goodnight
The subway trains, violao gago
A christmas moon in black and white
The sting of tears, a scarlet sky
I'm watching all the colors in my head

Sitting in the dark we see
Images to stun, to cry
The fury of the sound, a samba beat
How do we embrace the past?
I will remember every moment
Ever, ever
