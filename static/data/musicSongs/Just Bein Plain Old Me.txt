Lyrics:


I like it here where I am
Leaving everyone be
Doing the things that I do
Just being plain old me

Here in my own little nest
I find contentment and rest
Happy as I can be
Just being plain old me

You never hear me crying
Cause I can't reach the sun
You never see me trying
To change places with anyone

Cause I like it here where I am
Leaving everyone be
Loving the one I love
Just being plain old me

Yeah, Billy

You're never hear me crying
Because I can't reach the sun
You'll never see me trying
To change places with anyone

Cause I like it here where I am
Minding my own business and leaving everyone be
Loving the one I love
Just being plain old me
