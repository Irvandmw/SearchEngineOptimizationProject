Lyrics:


Yo, check it out
First verse, drop it

Lord knows I'm gonna make it.
To brighter days I'm on my way.
I dreamed before and saw the way that I was misbehaving.
Now I'm standing face to face.

To my reflection I can't see it.
My vision's blinded by the pain.
('Cause that's how I feel)

My mirror's broken.
I've been cursed with seven years of bad luck.
Will the sorrow ever change.

[Chorus]
So now my soul's in debt.
I must regret.
I die and live another lonely day.
Tell me how a man's supposed to change.

So now my souls in debt.
I must regret.
I die and live another lonely day.
Tell me how a man's supposed to change.
How's a man supposed to change?
Tell me

My fear is growing old unhappy.
Without my loved ones next to me.
Ink on my skin has nearly faded.
Incarcerated for my sins.

To my reflection I can't see it.
My vision's blinded by the pain. (by the pain y'all)

My mirror's broken.
I've been cursed with seven years of bad luck.
Will the sorrow ever change.
That's right, by the pain

[Chorus]
So now my soul's in debt.
I must regret.
I die and live another lonely day.
Tell me how a man's supposed to change.

So now my soul's in debt (soul's in debt)
I must regret.
I die and live another lonely day.
Tell me how a man's supposed to change

Blue, sing

How a man's supposed to change

How am I supposed to change

Blue

So now my souls in debt.
I must regret.
I die and live another lonely day.
Tell me how a man's supposed to change

So now my soul's in debt.
I must regret.
I die and live another lonely day.
Tell me how a man's supposed to change

How's a man supposed to change y'all?

Tell me how a man's supposed to change
Tell me how a man's supposed to change
Tell me how a man's supposed to change

So now my soul's in debt.
I must regret.
I die and live another lonely day.
Tel me how a man's supposed to change
So now my soul's in debt.
I must regret.
I die and live another lonely day.
