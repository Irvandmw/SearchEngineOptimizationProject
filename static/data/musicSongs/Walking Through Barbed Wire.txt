Lyrics:


Wish I could see you for one last time 
Wish I could say goodbye to you 
It's hard to deal with you dying 
It's time to say goodbye to you 

Bloody-faced 
Kissing death 
Walking through barbed wire 
I'll let you go 
Let me go digging thru myself 

I would die for you 
I'd walk right thru barbed wire 

Good luck in your next life 
Walk as tall as the trees 
Be gentle as spring winds 
And have the warmth of summer sun 

I would die die for you 
I'd walk right through barbed wire 
I blame myself for your death 
It's tearing me apart 

I would die die for you 
Yes I would 
Let you go 
Let me go digging through myself 

Bloody-faced 
Kissing death 
Walking through barbed wire
