Lyrics:


No one's gonna love you like I do
No one's gonna care like I do
And I can feel it in the way that you breathe
I know you dream of her while you sleep next to me

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you, I ain't the same
So, pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever (woah)
So, pour a shot in my glass, 'cause it makes everything better (woah)

(Woah)
(Woah)
I can't stop...
(Woah)
(Woah)
I can't stop drinking about you

Darling, tell me what more can I do?
Don't you know that I was meant for you?

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you, I ain't the same
So, pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever (woah)
So, pour a shot in my glass, 'cause it makes everything better (woah)

I can't stop...
(Woah)
(Woah)
