Lyrics:


When I'm here in your arms
I feel love in my heart
I can breathe
Not even pinching myself
I don't care
I'm with you, you're with me

I never wished on the star
When the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in the dreams

When I close my eyes
I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me, oh

Let me know if this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (without you, babe) oh
Let me know if this is a dream
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe, about you, babe

So, I'd rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
If it's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please

I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I supposed to be

When I close my eyes
I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me
Oh

Let me know if this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (without you, babe), oh
Let me know if this is my dream
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe, about you, babe

So, I'd rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
If that's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh

It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you, baby
And now that I'm here with you I'm gonna take it in, breathe you in
And if I am dreaming let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you than be living life without me and you, you

[2x]
Let me know if this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (without you, babe), oh
Let me know if this is my dream
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe, about you, babe
So, I'd rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
If that's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
