Lyrics:


Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful Truth
Don't leave because I can't see you.
Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful Truth
Don't leave because I can't see you.

You know the hours that I passed without you
Every heartbeat that I chose to flout you
And how I felt no shame
I know this problem is of my own making
I know you're giving here and I'm not taking
But please don't leave this place

Beautiful...

Don't let me complicate what you made simple
By looking fancy or sounding boastful
Please bring me down

And now that I have said what's on my mind
And its obvious that I am blind
Please say you'll stay

Beautiful...

Spin me round
Bring me down
Be my sound
But don't leave.
