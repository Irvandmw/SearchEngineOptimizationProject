Lyrics:


Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo-hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, it's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song in a wintry wonderland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending to a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! pop! pop!
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful thing are the things we remember all through our lives

Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together
Lovely weather for a sleigh ride together, ooh, together with you
Lovely weather, for a sleigh ride
Come on, baby, lovely weather for a sleigh ride
Oh, yeah
