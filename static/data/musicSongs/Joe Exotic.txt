Lyrics:


[Tonya Brewer:]
Joe Exotic, breeds tigers and lions, chaotic
His obsession with Carol, psychotic (He's got a point)
Turns people gay 'cause he's got it (He's got the meth)
It's hypnotic (He's got the meth)
Joe Exotic

[Sia:]
Big explosion
Competing with others, it's nasty (he so nasty)
Tight jeans on and his brace goes on lastly (Wobble, wobble)
Dropping songs about carol is ghastly
Did you say ghastly? (Did you say ghastly?)

[Maddie Ziegler:]
Tiger lover
Breeds cubs for money, we discovered
Petting zoos, he ran for governor
Prince Albert to please his two husbands? (Got infected)
What's up with him?
Carol

[Carol Baskin:]
Hey, all you cool cats and kittens

[Tonya Brewer:]
Joe Exotic, breeds tigers and lions, chaotic
His obsession with Carol, psychotic (He's got a point)
Turns people gay 'cause he's got it (He's got the meth)
It's hypnotic (He's got the meth)
Joe Exotic
