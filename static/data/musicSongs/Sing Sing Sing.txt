Lyrics:


Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing
Everybody's Got To Sing
Stick With Us We'll Have A Ball.

Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing
Everybody's Got To Sing
Stick Around We'll Have It All.

Music Brightens Up The Day
Now, If You Like It We Will Stay.

Sing, Sing, Sing, Sing
Everybody's Got To Sing
Stick Around, Shake It Down.
