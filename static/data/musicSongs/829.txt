Lyrics:


I am scared [x8]

Pray, I said pray [x4]
Pray, pray, pray, pray!

I will push away from a love that is close to me, I'll go away [x2]

Pray, pray

Because I, I think I'm scared of myself
My problems and faults, they lay upon a shelf
Bring it out with the shroom, I'm paranoid, laying crouched in a room
I will push away from a love that is close to me, I'll go away
I will push away from a love that is close to me, I'll go away

Pray, pray

Because I, I need to be stable like my buddy with grey bell
Called up my mom, cause I knew she was strong
Talking about my Jesus, my daddy, and bongs
Talking about my Jesus, my daddy, and bongs

Called up my mom, cause i know she was strong
Talking about my Jesus, my daddy, and bongs
[x4]

Because I, I think I'm scared of myself
My problems and faults, they lay upon a shelf
Bring it out with the shroom, I'm paranoid, laying crouched in a room
Aside from the world that I know, people and what-not, and girls that do blow
Brought back to childhood, not close to feeling good

I will push away from a love that is close to me, I'll go away
I will push away from a love that is close to me, I'll go away, away

I am scared [x8]

Go! [x4]

Go away

Go aaaaway [x3]

Go away!
