Lyrics:


These unguarded moments
When you move across the floor
And look in my direction
As I look back in yours
A questions asked a pledge is made
With fire in your eyes
The unguarded moments remind me

Of a picture drawn upon my heart
Before I was 16
And though I'd never met you
It felt real inside the dream
We fought and loved
And fought again
Till all the pain was gone
But these unguarded moments lived on

You take a chance and love someone
There's nothing left to lose
Just let go and give in
Then you'll win, then you'll win

You take a chance and love someone
There's nothing left to lose
Just let go and give in
Then you'll win, then you'll win

These unguarded moments
As you move across the floor
