Lyrics:


[(Bbno$ & Y2K), Carly Rae Jepsen, & {Both}:]
Did I really just forget that melody?
(Naw, na, na, banananananana) Dada, yeah
(Alright), {dada dadadada}

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
When I popped off, then they all call me, maybe later, I can't talk now
Carly so cold, she from the north, she from the Canada
Forty-five dates, I'm on the road
And you know I always sell out the show
[Bbno$:]
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
Let's give it a vibe

[Bbno$:]
Cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
CÃ³mo se mueve mi mucha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Ay, mami, cuando tÃº te agacha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
CÃ³mo lo mueve mi mucha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
How I stride like that

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
I'm not really looking for a ring
I'm pretty but I'll never send a pic
Modest with my jewels, but check the bank
Got money, but I still want him to pay

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
When I popped off, then they all call me, maybe later, I can't talk now
Carly so cold, she from the north, she from the Canada
Forty-five dates, I'm on the road
And you know I always sell out the show
[Bbno$, (Carly Rae Jepsen & bbno$):]
I shine my wrist, it go like (shashasha, shashasha)
I got your bitch singing like (lalala, lalala)
I shine my wrist, it go like (shashasha, shashasha)
I got your bitch singing like (lalala, lalala)
(How I stride like that)

[Bbno$, with (Carly Rae Jepsen):]
Amex, no cap, eight hundred score
They wonder how, (how I guap like that)
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how, (how I stride like that)

[Enrique Iglesias:]
Vamo' a darle al cuerpo mÃ¡s de ritmo
Pa' que no sea mÃ¡s de lo mismo
Te voy diciendo cosas al oÃ­do
TÃº sabe' que lo nuestro es divertido (Yeah)
Va-va-vamo' a pedirno' otra ronda
Un poco 'e reggaetÃ³n pa' entrar en onda
Es un aviÃ³n que prende la turbinas
Que vuela y chupa mucha gasolina (Ey)

[Bbno$, with (Carly Rae Jepsen):]
When I popped off, then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like (shashasha, shashasha)
I got your bitch singing like (lalala, lalala)
I shine my wrist, it go like (shashasha, shashasha)
I got your bitch singing like (lalala, lalala)
(How I stride like that)
