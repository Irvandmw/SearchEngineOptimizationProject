Lyrics:


Two loves have I
And they tear me apart
Two loves have I
Both are in my heart

One is a flower
And the other a flame
Two loves have I
But they're not the same

When I'm in a gay mood
Tis then my light love I crave
Then again at times
My other love can make me a slave

I can't deny
That to both I am true
Two loves have I
Both of them are you

I can't deny
That to both I am true
Two loves have I
Both of them are you
Two loves have I
Both of them are you
