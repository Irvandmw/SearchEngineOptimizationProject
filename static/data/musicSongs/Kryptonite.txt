Why when you come around girl you weaken me so
You weaken me so
It's like your body take over, you have control
Ain't nothing I can't do, more than I can handle
Lick me into my doom, 'nything you want tomorrow
And I love it
Way it takes over me

Every Superman has his kryptonite
Yeah, kryptonite

I have all of the power in the world
Money, fame, blessings in my life
But I'm steady controlled by this one girl
When too many women want to be my wife
The prettiest attitude, love what you gotta do
Kiss me more when I'm mad at you
Uh whoa
So we can [?] when you in my space

Every Superman has his kryptonite
Yeah, kryptonite
Every Superman has his kryptonite
Oh, kryptonite
You might krypto krypto krypto krypto-nite
You might krypto krypto krypto krypto-nite
You might krypto krypto krypto krypto-nite
