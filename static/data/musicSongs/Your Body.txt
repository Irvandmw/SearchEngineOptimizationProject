Lyrics:


I came here tonight
To get shit out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find
So open the box
Don't need no key I'm unlocked
And I won't tell you to stop

Hey boy!
I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
Hey boy!
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walking

All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night
I know you want it

All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night
I know you want it

It's true what you heard
I am a freak, I'm disturbed
So come on and give me your worst
We're moving faster then slow
If you don't know where to go
I'll finish off on my own

Hey boy!
I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
Hey boy!
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walking

Say say hey

All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night
I know you want it

All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night
I know you want it

I think you already know my name
I think you already know my name

Hey hey, ha! Alright, say

I think you already know my name

All I wanna do is love your body
(Hey, hey,say)
Tonight's your lucky night
I know you want it

All I wanna do is love your body
(Say, say, hey)
Tonight's your lucky night
I know you want it
