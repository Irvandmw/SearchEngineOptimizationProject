Lyrics:


She's everything 
a married man 
should look for in a girl
She's married too
but not to you
and that's part of the thrill
She's the one who makes you feel alright
Her alibi's your alibi - it's watertight

She's old enough
to know of love
and know that this is not
But young enough
to not be willing
to settle for what she's got
She's the one who makes you feel alright
Her alibi's your alibi - it's watertight

And if you get caught
you're going to hell
but it's heaven right now

She's the one who makes you feel alright
Her alibi's your alibi - it's watertight

She's everything 
a married man 
should look for in a girl
She's married too
but not to you
and that's part of the thrill
She's the one who makes you feel alright
Her alibi's your alibi - it's watertight

She's the one who makes you feel alright
Her alibi's your alibi - it's watertight

Oh, and you're going to hell
but it's heaven right now
