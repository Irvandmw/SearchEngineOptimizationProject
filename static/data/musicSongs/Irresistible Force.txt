Lyrics:


In the name of love and life
Turn your face to the lonely night
But you're not alone when she calls you home
And this your world is on the edge
As good as lost but you know the way
Through this faceless town and she pulls me down
I know the place and the time (of our lives)
So long ago, and all through the years (never dies)
All things must pass
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow
Invisible fingers and indescribable pleasure
I get to find my personal god
I get to find my personal god
God of love, God of gold
Ring of fire in the days of old
It's what I'm living for
And love's the only law
So answer mayday SOS
Search me north south east or west
It's all I miss, just the one last kiss
This is goodbye to the days (of our lives)
My fair-weather friend
I feel your sorrow and tears (they are mine)
I share to the end
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and
Human animal magic, how far can you go
The rolling of thunder and you decide what your after
I get to find my personal god
I get to find my personal god
I surrender all or nothing
You must spread your wings and fly
I know the place and the time (of our lives)
My fair-weather friend
I feel your sorrow and tears (they are mine)
I share to the end
When an irresistible force meets an immovable object
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow
There's bound to be a heartbreak
You make it the hard way
I surrender all or nothing
You must spread your wings and fly
