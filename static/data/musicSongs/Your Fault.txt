Lyrics:


You had your chance
There's no reason to cry about it now
You changed your plans
Hope that's still more important to you now
No, I don't wanna talk

You better know that this is all your fault
I hope you know that this is all your fault

You can't look back
All that shit doesn't matter anymore
You're way off track

You better know that this is all your fault
I hope you know that this is all your fault
You better know that this is all your fault
I hope you know that this is all your fault

Why do you think about it?
Why do you sing about it?
Why do you care at all?
Man, I don't know what I can say
It's like she can't appreciate me
And it makes me feel so goddamn small
I try to tell you, but I've got no voice
And you won't listen, so I have no choice
It's time for you to move on without me
Just don't forget that this is all
All your fault
All your fault

You can't come back
Things could never be the same as before
Can't have me anymore
You say I'm going nowhere
And that's what makes me keep dreaming
You wish I would just shut up
And that's what makes me keep screaming
You tell me to watch my step
Instead, I'm falling out of love
I thought you were all that I had
But without you I've got it all

It's all your fault
All your fault
You better know that this is all your fault
I hope you know that this is all your fault

Why do you think about it?
Why do you sing about it?
Why do you care at all?
Man, I don't know what else to say
It's like she can't appreciate the things
She knows will make her feel so tall
I try to tell you, but I've got no voice
And you won't listen, so I have no choice
It's time for you to move on without me
Just don't forget that this is all your fault
(All your fault)
(All your fault)
(All your fault) Yeah yeah yeah!
(All your fault)
