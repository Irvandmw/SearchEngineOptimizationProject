Lyrics:


This magic moment
So different and so new
But like any other
Until I kissed you

And then it happened
It took me by surprise 
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment 
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever 
Forever till the end of time

Magic moment...
