Lyrics:


We are Siamese if you please
We are Siamese if you don't please
We are from a residence of Siam
There is no finer cat than I am

Do you see that thing swimming round and round
Maybe we can reach on in and make it drown
If we sneaking up upon it carefully
There will be head for you and a tail for me

We are Siamese if you please
We are Siamese if you don't please
Now we're looking over our new domisile
If we like we stay for maybe quite a while

Meow.......here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty

Do you hear what I hear a baby cry
Where we finding baby there's milk near by
And if we look in baby buggy there could be 
Plenty of milk for you and also some for me

We are Siamese if you please
We are Siamese if you don't please
Now we're looking over our new domisile
If we like we stay for maybe quite a while

We are Siamese if you please
We are Siamese if you don't please
We are from a residence of Siam
There is no finer cat than I am

There is no finer cat than I am 

There are no finer cats than we am
