Song Name: Trying To Reason With Hurricane Season
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Squalls out on the gulf stream
Big storms coming soon
I passed out in my hammock
God, I slept a way past noon
Stood up and tried to focus
I hoped I wouldn't have to look far
I knew I could use a Bloody Mary
So I stumbled next door to the bar

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes, it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out and then I can go on

There's something about this Sunday
It's a most peculiar gray
Strolling down the avenue
That's known as A1A
Feeling tired, then I got inspired
I knew that it wouldn't last long
So all alone I walked back home
Sat on the beach and then I made up this song

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes, it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out and then I can go on

Well, the wind is blowin' harder now
Fifty knots of there abouts
There's white caps on the ocean
And I'm watching for water spouts
It's time to close the shutters
It's time to go inside
In a week I'll be in ol' Paris
Yeah that's a mighty long airplane ride

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes, it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out and then I can go on
Yes, it cleans me out and then I can go on
Yes, it cleans me out and then I can go on
