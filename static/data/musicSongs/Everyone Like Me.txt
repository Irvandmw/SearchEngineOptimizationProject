Lyrics:


I've got a lot going on inside
Don't know if I can work things out this time
Need a little space to clear my mind
But I'll be fine

Don't slip, it's not always this cold
I'm tired of acting like I know
Am I searching for the answers?
No one knows

And I must confess
Before I take another step that

This song's for everyone like me
Everyone not afraid to stand alone and lonely
Can you identify with me?
This song's for everyone like you
Come and ride with me
We will not back down

Wait, it might not be too late
To avoid the tension we create
How about I turn and walk away?
No matter what you say

It's not a combination
I've tried to figure you out
I'm looking for the confirmation
So I can turn this around

And I must confess
Before I take another step that

This song's for everyone like me
Everyone not afraid to stand alone and lonely
Can you identify with me?
This song's for everyone like you
Come and ride with me
We will not back down

Every time I turn around
You're looking for attention
You've taken all the things I've said and
Throw them away, drank them away
Every time you show up late
You're looking for forgiveness

I must confess
Before I take another step that

This song's for anyone who ever took a chance
Who started at the bottom to get to the top
And no matter what you face in this life
You gotta know what you're up against
In order to fight back

This song's for everyone like me
Everyone not afraid to stand alone and lonely
Can you identify with me?
This song's for everyone like you
Come and ride with me
We will not back down

This song's for everyone like me
Everyone not afraid to stand alone
And lonely and lonely
