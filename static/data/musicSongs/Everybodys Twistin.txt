Lyrics:


Weeell, they have to have something new,
A dance to do for recreation so someone started twistin',
A cat who was really hep, puts down a step
To new gyration soon, all the kids were twistin',
It didn't take long before the grown-ups were trying it,
Who's who was buying it all over town,
You see them, a-squirming and a-worming and a-twistin' around,
It spread like a fire, its place became a craze
That rocks the nation now, everybody's twistin'.

[musical interlude]

Well oh well oh well oh well, they had to have something new,
A dance to do for recreation so someone started twistin',
And a cat who was really hep, he puts down a step
To new gyration soon, all the kids were twistin',
No, it didn't take long before the grown-ups were trying it,
Who's who was buying it all over town,
You see them, a-squirming and a-worming and a-twisting around
It spread like a fire, its place became a craze
That rocks the nation now, everybody's twistin'.
Here's a-hopping, and a stopping, and a poppin',
Sacro really, ax a bopping, everybody's twistin'.  Bop!
