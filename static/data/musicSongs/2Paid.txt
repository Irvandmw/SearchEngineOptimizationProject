Lyrics:


2paid, 2paid, need a new K
New babe, new fade, nigga new wave
New way, this way, if you want cake (bling)
Don't play, don't play, I'm just 2 paid (bloaw)

2paid, 2paid, need a new K
New babe, new fade, nigga new wave
New way, this way, if you want cake (bling)
Don't play, don't play, I'm just 2 paid (bloaw)

And you know just how we rockin' (you know)
You ain't really on the block and (nah)
You ain't never finna pop one (bow)
I be makin' hoes go dumb
Shit ain't really what it seem no more
Niggas turnin' into fiend for doe
I be only 'bout my team, you know
I been mosey since a minute ago (back then)
Ask yo hoe these bitches know now (yes they know)
That's why I seen them at the shows, now
Imma put on for my home town
If you frontin', you get knocked down

2paid, 2paid, need a new K
New babe, new fade, nigga new wave
New way, this way, if you want cake (bling)
Don't play, don't play, I'm just 2 paid (bloaw)

Imma get fresh today
Wit' niggas I swear they gon' spray
Not free yes you gon' have to pay
So save dat for another day, ay
I do what these niggas lyin' bout
Get yo money up, I'm askin' niggas what they cryin' bout (cryin' bout what)
Walk up in the mall and you know I had to buy it out
Faced another wood now I'm really, really, flyin' out (ay, ay)
A nigga bout his bucks (hell ya)
A nigga really blowin' up, yuh
Yes, you know what's up
When I pop out the cut, ay

2paid, 2paid, need a new K
New babe, new fade, nigga new wave
New way, this way, if you want cake (bling)
Don't play, don't play, I'm just 2 paid (bloaw)
