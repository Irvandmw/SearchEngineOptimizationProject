Lyrics:


Woke up and I feel like shit 
I don't remember last night, I'm getting sick of this 
I hit the bottle when I got off stage 
And got piss drunk stupid and went in a rage 
I think I mighta got into a fight 
Because my knuckles were bloody and I don't feel alright 
I hit the bottom and I don't even care 
Some say I'm going to hell but I'm already there

[Pre-Chorus:]
Sick and tired of being sick and tired 

[Chorus:]
I wanna be free from this ball and chain and 
Be free from this life of pain and 
Be free from this ball and chain 
I wanna be free from you 

Now I'm full of guilt and shame 
I can't point a finger cause theres no one to blame 
So I say I'll never do it again 
But when the sun goes down, you are my only friend 
I'm thinking I am starting to see 
I have become everything I never wanted to be 
I'm really getting sick of myself 
Cause when I look into the mirror, I see somebody else 

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus x2]

Sick and tired of being sick and tired 
So sick and tired of being sick and tired 
Sick and tired of being sick and tired 
So sick and tired of being sick and tired 

[Chorus x2]
