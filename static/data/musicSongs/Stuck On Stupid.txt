Lyrics:


Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
Just a little too into you
That's for sure
(Ooh babe)
What your beauty does to me
Makes me forget about your faults
You do no wrong
Ooh woah ooh oh hoh oh

They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I've got to
I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you
No lie
And girl I lose it every time

There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help
Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid
I'm Stuck on stupid for you
Look what you do to me

It's confusing
How you do it
It's like you take my heart and glue it to your soul
Yeah baby
And I'd do anything for you
Ooh you know that much it's true
Girl I'm so in love
I'm stupid

They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I've got to
I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you
No lie
And girl I lose it every time

There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help,
Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid,
I'm stuck on stupid for you
Ooh ooh ooh
Look what you do to me

If you told me to go rock climbing
To prove my love to you
You know I would've died trying
Got everything to lose
I'm not tryna play it cool
The stupid things I do
I do it for you

There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help
Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid
I'm stuck on stupid for you
Look what you do to me
