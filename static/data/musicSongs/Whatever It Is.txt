Lyrics:


Whatever it is, it's only the beginning
Whatever it takes, it's everything you're giving
No one but you could ever let me see
This woman inside of me was never really free

And if I cry, understand my reasons
You take my hand and touching is believing
When I was sure that I had loved before
You came into my life and brought me so much, so much more

Whatever it is
I hope that we can love this way forever
Darling, it just gets better
Whenever we kiss
The magic of the moment keeps returning
Darling, I keep learning
Whatever it is, it's all I'll ever need

Lost in a dream that paints a perfect picture
You know my heart has gone from rags to riches
You give so much that words could never measure
And time could not erase this feeling that I treasure

Oh, whatever it is
I hope that we can love this way forever
Darling, it just gets better
Whenever we kiss
The magic of the moment keeps returning
Yes, yes, yes, and I keep learning
Whatever it is, it's all I'll ever need
Whatever it is, ooh, ooh, ooh, it's all I'll ever need
