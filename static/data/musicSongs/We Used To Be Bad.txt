Lyrics:


Tall grass is where my tribe is hiding out
Can we pretend that it flew
Straight enough to land on the fairway
And it won't hurt now

We used to be bad like that
But it felt right burning through our daddys' cash
And our nana's cigarettes
We used to be bad like that
In the good old days oh if we only knew back then
That's the best it's gonna get

It's been years
Since we have gotten high enough
Starting to feel like I am drying up
So let's drink the whole thing before I turn to stone

We used to be bad like that
But it felt right burning through our daddy's cash
And our nana's cigarettes
We used to be bad like that
In the good old days oh if we only knew back then
That's the best it's gonna get

How can you live if you just gonna stand around
It's all I've tried
Life is too short to feel constricted
And all we do is that

Tall grass
I'm just so tired of playing by
The rules
