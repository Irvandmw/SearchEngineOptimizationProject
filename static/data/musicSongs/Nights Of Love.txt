Lyrics:


The wicked game that you play so good.
I'm falling hard just like you knew I would.
This won't last, it's too good.
I can't stop but I know I should.

[Chorus:]
Days of war into nights of love.
Heaven's on fire and I'm on the run.
Dancing with the devil in the midnight sun.
I'm falling in love
I'm coming undone

And I'm coming undone
(coming undone)

Out of my head in a memory of you.
I'll never forget what you put me through.
It wasn't right, what you did.
But I was just as wrong as you.

[Chorus x2]

I'm on the outside looking in
I turned my back on myself again
I'm on the ledge, I'm calling out
Somebody better come and talk me down
I said I'll never do it again
But then I keep on giving in
I gotta turn my world around
Because it keeps on knocking me down
Knocking me down.

I fell hard, It felt good
This won't last, I wish it would
It wasn't right what you did
but I was just as wrong as you

[Chorus]

Days of war into nights of love
Heaven's on fire and I'm on the run
Dancing with the devil in the midnight sun
I'm out of my head
I'm coming undone

I'm on the outside looking in
I turned my back on myself again
I'm on the ledge, I'm calling out
Somebody better come and talk me down
I said I'll never do it again
But then I keep on giving in
I gotta turn my world around
Because it keeps on knocking me down
Knocking me down
Knocking me down
Yeah
