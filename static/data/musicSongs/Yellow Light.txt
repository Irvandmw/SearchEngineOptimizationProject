Lyrics:


The yellow light shining down
The yellow light shining down
The yellow light shining down
The yellow light shining

1, 2, 1, 2...
Everybody, everybody...
Let's go, let's go...
Oh, hey!

Everyone's overdosing the blue light use
United States of Anxiety continues
Brat is in his tower singing the flag burning blues
But we feel like the nuts 'cause we feel the screws
We don't care 'bout no fit
We don't care 'bout no trouble
We just wanna get in
Let's make out like we're lovers

So much for taking it slow
Now everybody knows
Here we go!

The yellow light shining down (congratulations)
The yellow light shining down (whoopi do)
The yellow light shining down (you control the world now)
The yellow light shining down (look at you)
The yellow light shining down (I said, "Hey!")
The yellow light shining down (there's a higher power)
The yellow light shining down (like a yellow light)
The yellow light shining down

When the stupid gets injected
The sunlight's the best disinfectant
Oh, just let the sun dry
It be like that sometimes

We don't care 'bout no fit
We don't care 'bout no trouble
We just wanna get in
Let's make out like we're lovers

So much for taking it slow
Now everybody knows
Here we go!

The yellow light shining down (congratulations)
The yellow light shining down (whoopi do)
The yellow light shining down (you control the world now)
The yellow light shining down (look at you)
The yellow light shining down (I said, "Hey!")
The yellow light shining down (there's a higher power)
The yellow light shining down (like a yellow light)
The yellow light shining down

Kill whatever you want
And undo what was done
But one thing you can't kill is the fun
(Fun, fun, fun, fun...)

The yellow light shining down (congratulations)
The yellow light shining down (whoopi do)
The yellow light shining down (you control the world now)
The yellow light shining down (look at you)
The yellow light shining down (I said, "Hey!")
The yellow light shining down (there's a higher power)
The yellow light shining down (like a yellow light)
The yellow light shining down

So much for taking it slow
Now everybody knows
Here we go!
Here we go!

So much for taking it slow
Now everybody knows
Here we go!

The yellow light shining down (congratulations)
The yellow light shining down (whoopi do)
The yellow light shining down (you control the world now)
The yellow light shining down (look at you)
The yellow light shining down (I said, "Hey!")
The yellow light shining down (there's a higher power)
The yellow light shining down (like a yellow light)
The yellow light shining down
