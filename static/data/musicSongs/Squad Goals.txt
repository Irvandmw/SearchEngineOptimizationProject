Lyrics:


Squad, squad
My squad, squad

Squad goals, squad goals (Squad goals)
The only thing that keeps me sane is my woes (my woes)
Squad goals, squad goals (Squad goals)
My team put up big, five thousand on hoes
Squad goals, squad goals (Squad)
We couldn't fake niggas off, that's how it goes
Squad goals, squad goals (Squad goals)
My team put up big, five thousand on hoes

And my squad goes
I promise I never let a nigga come and change, and we did
And I just left five at the airport, it feel like it came from the crib
See, these niggas be using our names
'Cause they tryna make people love them
But no these niggas are not the same
'Cause my niggas came from the struggle
Don't believe me, then go ask my mama
She can tell you how it happened
Back when you were living with no problems
We was sleeping on the mattress
And no you will not be like my niggas
You're not even be like my bitches
'Cause we all do this shit for our family
But you do this shit for attention
And I just left Port of Miami
And they tryna send me to prison
And ain't nobody care about my niggas
My families, my fans and my bitches
Damn, I guess this how it goes
I'm just gon' charge it to the game and focus on my

Squad goals, squad goals (Squad goals)
The only thing that keeps me sane is my woes (my woes)
Squad goals, squad goals
A team put up five thousand, my hoes
Squad goals, squad goals (Squad)
We couldn't fake niggas off, that's how it goes
Squad goals, squad goals (Squad goals)
My team put up big, five thousand on hoes
And my squad goes
