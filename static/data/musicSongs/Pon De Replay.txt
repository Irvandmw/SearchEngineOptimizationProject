Come Mr. DJ song pon de replay
Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up
All the gyal pon the dancefloor wanting some more what
Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up

It goes 1 by 1 even 2 by 2
Everybody on the floor let me show you how we do
Let's go dip it low then you bring it up slow
Wind it up 1 time wind it back once more

Come, run, run, run, run
Everybody move run
Let me see you move and
Rock it 'til the grooves done
Shake it 'til the moon becomes the sun (sun)
Everybody in the club give me a run (run)

If you ready to move say yeah, yeah
One time for your mind say yeah, yeah

Come let me show ya
You want to groove
