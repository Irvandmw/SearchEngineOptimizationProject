Lyrics:


Now, I've been accused of going Hollywood
Chasing some cinematic schemes
But I'll give you Panavision pictures
If you give me Technicolour dreams

I never thought in terms of growing old
Nothing is ever as it seems
But I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cause you give me Technicolour dreams

Up there, walking on air
I'd like to show you how
I loved you way back then
As much as I need you now

Some people like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
And I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cause you give me Technicolour dreams

Oh wow, look at us now
All of our dreams fulfill
I would implore you still
From under your windowsill

Sometimes, I'd like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
So I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cause you give me Technicolour dreams
Technicolour dreams

I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cause you give me Technicolour dreams

Go far, follow your star
I'll help you climb that hill
I would adore you still
From under your windowsill

Sometimes, I'd like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
So I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cause you give me Technicolour dreams
Technicolour dreams
