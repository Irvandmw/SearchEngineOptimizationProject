Lyrics:


How long before the train goes by
It never seems to get here
How long before the train goes by
Will I just sit here forever
How long

Time and time I've tried to speak
But no one seems to listen
And life's too short to carry on
So I guess I'll just sit here and listen
How long

Time goes so slowly when you want to go
And you can't find a reason to leave
I think you know what it's doing to me
And that's fine, if that's what you wanna see

How long before the train goes by
It never seems to get here
How long before the train goes by
Will I just sit here forever
How long
How long
