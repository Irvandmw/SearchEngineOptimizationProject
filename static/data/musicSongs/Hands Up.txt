Lyrics:


Pull up with no awning, sex
Early in the morning
Girl, I came to give you something
And I know you're gonna love it, huh
Hold up a lighter to put down my fire
Unless she lettin' me drown in the water
She the only one that make me feel like this
That girl I love, oh

Ooh yeah, every time I'm with you
Come and let me kiss you
Baby, what's the issue?
Save up yet I'm with you baby

You right girl, do what the fuck you like girl
Get crazy, I'ma let it ride, ride, ride
She don't care, I'ma live it for the night
Hands up high
You right girl, do what the fuck you like girl
Get crazy, I'ma let it ride, ride, ride
She don't care, I'ma live it for the night
Hands up high

I'm drivin', I'ma follow your directions
Just sit back and ride, ride, ride
Oh, ride, ride, ride

Pull up with no awning, sex
Early in the morning
Girl, I came to give you something
And I know you're gonna love it

Ooh yeah, every time I'm with you
Come and let me kiss you
Baby, what's the issue?
Save up yet I'm with you baby

You right girl, do what the fuck you like girl
Get crazy, I'ma let it ride, ride, ride
She don't care, I'ma live it for the night
Hands up high
You right girl, do what the fuck you like girl
Get crazy, I'ma let it ride, ride, ride
She don't care, I'ma live it for the night
Hands up high

You right girl
Hands up high
Get crazy, I'ma let it ride, ride, ride
Don't care, I'ma live it for the night
Hands up high
Hands up high
Hands up high
Hands up high
Hands up high
Hands up high
Hands up high

You right girl, do what the fuck you like girl
Get crazy, I'ma let it ride, ride, ride
She don't care, I'ma live it for the night
Hands up high
You right girl, do what the fuck you like girl
Get crazy, I'ma let it ride, ride, ride
She don't care, I'ma live it for the night
Hands up high
