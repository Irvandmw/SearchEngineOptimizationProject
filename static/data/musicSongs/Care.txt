Lyrics:


I remember when told me back when we were young
You and me could be forever, you and me were strong
Somehow we got caught up in losing sight of everything
I remember when you told me

But you didn't have to tell me, I'll be honest
You're a nightmare at times
No, I didn't even notice you were stressed out
When you lashed out that night
No, it doesn't even matter, I'll be with you
For the rest of our lives

'Cause I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care

If we sit and talk it over we don't have to fight
Sometimes we still have our moments and our sleepless nights
Let's see what tomorrow brings, we can take on anything
If we sit and talk it over

But you didn't have to tell me, I'll be honest
You're a nightmare at times
No, I didn't even notice you were stressed out
When you lashed out that night
No, it doesn't even matter, I'll be with you
For the rest of our lives

'Cause I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care

I know, yeah, I know that you care

But you didn't have to tell me, I'll be honest
You're a nightmare at times
No, I didn't even notice you were stressed out
When you lashed out that night
And it doesn't even matter, I'll be with you
For the rest of our lives

'Cause I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care
