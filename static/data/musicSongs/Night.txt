Artist: Frank Sinatra Lyrics
Song Name: Night
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I can just about get through the day,
But the night makes me nervous
Not for any reason.
Except maybe that it catches you unaware,
And follows you the way a woman follows
When she wants something..

[music interlude]

I've been in every kind of night,
Why, I shouldn't be afraid of darkness,
But for some reason, the night makes me nervous.

[music to the end]
