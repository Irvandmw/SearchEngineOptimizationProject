Lyrics:


I can't believe I could've been so blind,
But love is strange.
I thought about it for a long, long time,
But the truth remains.
I don't need another lonely night to dry my tears.
The answer's plain as black and white,
And I can see the picture very clear.

I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart.
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl.
I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart.
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye?

It isn't like you never had the chance
To change your tune.
Did you think that I'm a dime a dance?
Well the dance is through.
I've been doin' things your way too long,
But baby that's over.
It won't be easy, but I've gotta be strong,
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder.

I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart.
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl.
I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart.
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye?

I'll find someone else who's nothing like you.
Two can play the game as well,
And you're gonna be sorry, baby,
When it's over!

[Guitar Interlude]

I've been doin' things your way too long,
But baby that's over.
It won't be easy but I've gotta be strong,
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder.

I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart.
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl.
I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart.
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye?
