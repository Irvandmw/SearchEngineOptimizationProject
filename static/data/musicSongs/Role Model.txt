Lyrics:


She's been around for a number of years
Had success with two career
she gives dying people hope, how does she cope?
She snorts a line of coke before an audience with the Pope
she's a role model for today a role model for today
I don't care what you say, she's a role model for today

She's got better looking kids than you
She's got a better looking husband too
She is a sweet little honey, three times a mummy
You wouldn't know it cause she's got a flat little tummy
She's a role model for today, she is a role model for today
I don't care what you say she is a role model for today

but the lady's loved and the lady's cried
And the lady's cried and loved and now
The lady's signed a big book deal
And the story tells you how it all began
In the days when the lady didn't have
The price of her next meal, and its real

There's a secret to her success
She's got balls like the S.A.S.
She's got more balls than me, more balls then you
More balls than all the sweatshops
Making balls for Man U.
She's a role model for today, a role model for today
I don't care what you say she's a role model for today

But the lady's loved and the lady's cried
and the lady's cried and loved and now
the lady's signed a big book deal
The story tells you how it all began
In the days when the lady didn't have
The price of her next meal, and its all real

She's a star in every way
she is loved by straights and gays
She's taking water by the sip
a baby on her hip
a little silver ring through her lower set of lips
she's a role model for today, she is a role model for today
I don't care what you say she's a role model for today
I don't care what you say she's a role model for today
What you say, she's a role model for today
