Lyrics:


You fuckin' did it
You really did it yeah
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it

You fuckin' did it
You really did it yeah
You fuckin' did it
You fuckin' did it

All those who are hangin' around the water cooler
Will never believe how you tackled the thousand puzzle pieces
And you could see it before we completed it
Before we made it whole
How you put it all together with a blindfold

You're like a long game token that keeps the game goin'
But your claim to fame is how you like to lay low
Out of the lime light
Which can hurt your eyes
If you're not careful you'll become another devil in disguise

But you watch your back
You watch your back
You're growing eyes at the back of your head
To prevent another sneak attack
Sneak attack
You must be keepin' secret weapons in your fanny pack

You're like my laughing gas
You got the cat to dance
You're like Lance on a mountain in the Tour de France
You got a wing span spanning the globe
You got gold
And you're teaching us all to let go

You're a wise old owl when you're the cat's meow
If this were twelfth grade you would be my cap and gown
If this were India then you would be a sacred cow
And I'd bow down to you
So grateful to the gods for making you

You fucking did it
You really did it yeah
You frigging did it
You fuffing did it

Lalalalala
You really did it yeah
You fucking did it
Badadadada

You'll be standing up for the equal rights of the American people
And you'll be meeting all the influential seekers with a similar dream
You've got a front seat saved that's emblazed with your name
And a superhero cape on

See the future as a sky full of possibility
With a spryness of mind and a psychic ability
You probably won't die at the hands of an enemy
And not in a den of iniquity

You're not the average Joe
You're not the average Jane
You're not above or below
But you're never just plain
You never take no personally
And any time you get stopped you try another way

Could we settle for a kiss without a cease and desist
If they ask we won't tell 'cause we're activists
I am that I am and you are that you are
And we're all that is

How p-e-r-f-e-c-t your a-t-t-i-t-u-d-e be

What does that spell?

It spells "You did it"
You really did it yeah
You really did it
You frigging did it

You fucking did it
You really did it yeah
You done did it
You really did it, did it, did it

When you circumnavigating the turntable call and attracts
Like you be jumpin' in the water you be makin' a splash
You be keepin' your heart beat going
You be keepin' the harmony going

Well there's an awful lot of musical styles you could play
Well there's an awful lot of tastes
An awful lot of dates you could be on
You be keepin' your back bone strong
And you be keepin' the trombone blowin'

Well every friend of mine will give each other high-fives
When your beautiful mind is to your own devices
You do what you like and you always like what you try

You touch me like an iPhone application
Move me like a smooth jazz music station
Doin' what you do in the way that you choose to do them
Oh my god

You're quick to be so quotable
Damn you got a way with words
You got a magical handshake for saving the earth
You are a generous man
You are so awesome it hurts

And you are a-w-e-s-o-m-e

What does that spell?
It spells "You did it!"
You really did it, yeah
You really did it
You really did it, did it, did-id-id-id

You fucking did it
You really did it, yeah
You fucking did it
You fucking did it, did it, did-id-id-id

You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e

You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-me
