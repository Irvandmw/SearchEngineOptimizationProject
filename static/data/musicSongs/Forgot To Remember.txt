Lyrics:


Sweat on the skin as she moved to my direction
Stop, begin, I was way beyond protection
Gone in a glance, I was frozen when she found me
Lost in a trance, as she wrapped herself around me

And as her body melted on the line
She burned the memory of it on my mind

Shame on me, I forgot to remember to forget
Should have left her in my history
And I feel like I'd be better off dead
I forgot to remember

Ice in disguise, oh the fire she whispered to me
Rose colored lies hit me right where she knew me
She took me half the way to paradise
Then left me stranded as she waved goodbye

Shame on me, I forgot to remember to forget
Should have left her in my history
And I feel like I'd be better off dead
I forgot to remember

Holding on after the moment's gone and her scent has faded
Where she knows I'll always be...

Oh shame on me, I forgot to remember to forget
Should have left her in my history
And I feel like I'd be better off dead
I forgot to remember
I forgot to remember to forget
I feel like I'd be better off dead
I forgot to remember
