Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You know the sun is shining; it's raining in my heart.
I don't know what to do since we've been apart.
Why don't you tell me, babe, what is going on?
You know I love you darling, don't want to be alone.

[Chorus:]
They're tearing us apart,
They're breaking up my heart.
I knew it from the start:
Your friends are tearing us apart.

You know I can't go on, feeling this old way.
You know my heart is burning, it's burning everyday.
You know I love you, baby, no one else will do.
Why don't you reconsider, do what I want you to?

[Chorus 2x]

Your friends are tearing us apart,
Tearing us apart.
