Lyrics:


Girl, we waited long enough
Short dress is dangerous
Personality major plus
Come back it up

When I think about you and me
Red hot probably
Hey, baby, won't you set me free
Can't get enough

When you walked into my life
We were in a club that night
Never seen somebody looking so tight
When I'm all alone with you
I know just what I wanna do
I never been with anybody so right
So damn right

This is for my riders who like to get on down
This is for my girls 'cause you know I get on down
This is for my people
Can you holla back?
Tell me where the party at?

This is for my riders who like to get on down
This is for my girls 'cause you know I get on down
This is for my people
Can you holla back?
Tell me where the party at?

Girl, it's not a sacrifice
One look hypnotized
Get a six when I roll the dice
Come back it up

I been around the block before
One time, maybe more
My player days are gone for sure
I've had enough

When you walked into my life
We were in a club that night
Never seen somebody looking so tight
When I'm all alone with you
I know just what I wanna do
I've never been with anybody so right
So damn right

This is for the riders who like to get on down
This is for my girls 'cause you know I get on down
This is for my people
Can you holla back?
Tell me where the party at?

This is for the riders who like to get on down
This is for my girls 'cause you know I get on down
This is for my people
Can you holla back?
Tell me where the party at?

Is it over here?
Is it over there?
Is it over here?
Is it over there?

If you wanna ride â ride it with me
If you wanna slide â slide it with me
If you want it hot â it's hotter with me
And if you want it hard â we're hard as can be

If you wanna ride â ride it with me
If you wanna slide â slide it with me
If you want it hot â it's hotter with me
And if you want it hard â we're hard as can be

This is for the riders who like to get on down
This is for my girls 'cause you know I get on down
This is for my people
Can you holla back?
Tell me where the party at?

This is for the riders who like to get on down
This is for my girls 'cause you know I get on down
This is for my people
Can you holla back?
Tell me where the party at?

This is for the riders who like to get on down
This is for my girls 'cause you know I get on down
This is for my people
Can you holla back?
Tell me where the party at?

This is for the riders who like to get on down
This is for my girls 'cause you know I get on down
This is for my people
Can you holla back?
Tell me where the party at?

Tell me where the party at?
