Lyrics:


He's born in Vegas among the stars
And on his cheek beauty mark
Barely noticed it from the start
A constellation to stir my heart

Every night I'm wearing my black in case you're comin' 'round
Fifty-seven days and it still feels like I'm not comin' down

The night we painted over your fake Mona Lisa
Lipstick on the corners, said her smile was teasin' ya
Oh, you took my clothes off, said, "It's gettin' hotter."
Don't know how to swim, but let's breathe underwater

I was born a dreamer
I'm still that way
Live for tomorrow or yesterday

Every night I'm wearing my black in case you're comin' 'round
Fifty-seven days and it still feels like I'm not comin' down

The night we painted over your fake Mona Lisa
Lipstick on the corners, said her smile was teasin' ya
Oh, you took my clothes off, said, "It's gettin' hotter."
Don't know how to swim, but let's breathe underwater
