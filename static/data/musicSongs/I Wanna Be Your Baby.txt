Lyrics:


I'm gon' put it out there
Lay it on the line
And even if it breaks my heart
I'm giving it a try

Not waiting for tomorrow
Confessing it today
So baby here it goes
I'm out of time
It's do or die

I wanna be your baby
Won't you be my man?
I wanna be your soldier
When you're too weak to stand
Now I wanna be your baby
Be the end of your day
Forever in your life
Forever by your side
Forever I'll stay

I'm hanging on a thread here
I don't care if I fall
But I ain't gonna fall
Even though I don't know
If you feel me at all (if you feel me at all)

I'm ready to be right or wrong with you
I'm ready for my heart to win or lose
I'm ready to give all I've got to you
Boy, I want you to know

I wanna be your baby
Won't you be my man?
I wanna be your soldier
When you're too weak to stand
Now I wanna be your baby
Be the end of your day
Forever in your life
Forever by your side
Forever I'll stay

So I'm saying I love you
Ain't holding nothing back
And I'm saying I want you
I hope you don't mind that
And I'll wait on you forever
And I promise that
Oh baby
'Cause I love you
Oh I love

I wanna be your baby
Won't you be my man?
I wanna be your soldier
When you're too weak to stand
I wanna be your baby
End of your day
Forever life
Forever side
Forever stay

Let me be yours tonight (yeah)
Let me be yours
(let me be your baby boo tonight)
Let me be yours
(let me be yours)
Tonight
('cause I got to be your tonight)

Let me be yours tonight
('cause I got to be your tonight)
Let me be yours
Let me be yours tonight
('cause I got to be your tonight)

I wanna be your baby
Won't you be my man?
I wanna be your soldier
Baby baby
Be the end of your day
