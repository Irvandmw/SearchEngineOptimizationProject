Chamillitary man

[News Reporter]
Fighting broke out over-night between rival factions along the Israeli - Syrian border
Initial reports claim Israeli jet fighters bombed a guerrilla base,
Killing at least 49 soldiers and 13 civilians, damage to the base is said to be heavy
And the Israeli jets are reported to have made it back to their headquarters safely
An 49 year old unidentified man went berserk last night, opening fire with a 12 gauge shotgun...

[Chamillionaire]
Ring the alarm!
Terror alert, victory!
I stay dropping that bombness, Rosie O'Donnel and Donald Trump stay arguing bout nonsense
Would they treat me as good as Hugh Heffner if I had a mansion full of blonde chicks?
If adultery was a felony, then Clinton would be a convict
Put you in the same position and lets see what you'd really do
They tell me that I sold out if I execute the no snitching rule
Sound like it was a good idea, till a murder happen to you
Dumb-stupid, or stupid-dumb, either one you don't have a clue
Voice perfect for CNN but knew Larry King wouldn't hear it through
Bill O'Reily's an idiot, he ain't the only one with an opinion fool
E-mail this to my publicist so the media is gonna hear it too
You get on TV and get at me, then I'm gonna get on the CD and get at you

Uncle Sam says to pay your taxes, just to learn that I pay for classes
Part time hustle really ain't gonna last, so todays forecast is to make more cash
Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth
Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth
Its the morning news

In the strip club ballin', Bill Collecta keep calling
You ain't even tryna pay your bills, he show up and you dogging
White man balling, black man starving, looks like Al Sharpton found another cause to get
involved in
I cant hate to see a black man, and I don't hate to see a black hand
Crawling into that cookie jar cause theres plenty of dough up in that man
When your black and you educated people say "You ain't black man!"
May be black in your appearance but really whiter than Batman
CEO's are like slave masters and most of them don't even know it
Their employees are like slaves, work the bill but don't even own it
Your money right but your credit ain't, then the bank still wont loan it
If you're on top and ain't paying taxes then I hope you're enjoying your moment

Uncle Sam says to pay your taxes, just to learn that I pay for classes
Part time hustle really ain't gonna last, so todays forecast is to make more cash
Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth
Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth
Its the morning news

Hip-hop crunk music, hyphy music, slab music, sound like a nursing rhyme
Get a beat and rap to it, ain't speaking with a purpose, I'm gonna call it crap music
Y'all got your boys getting mad, my bad lets get back to it
Cigarettes are still causing cancer, and chronic smoke'll still get you high
In the streets or in the store, know a couple dollars wont get you by
Truth is a Paris Hilton jail cover story could never flop
For that sexy mug-shot I could get a million dollars a pop
Even Michaels in the media, they like to make examples of people just like you
Get involved and I bet the indite you, goto jail and I bet they don't write you
Yea, you ain't got a college degree then they'll say you're not intelligent
And if your class ain't Upper Class, then your opinion is irrelevant

Uncle Sam says to pay your taxes, just to learn that I pay for classes
Part time hustle really ain't gonna last, so todays forecast is to make more cash
Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth
Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth
Its the morning news

The world is crazy, every day I gotta wake up to this nonsense
Silly rappers think I'm worried about a punch-line
I show more purpose than your whole career in one line
Victory
