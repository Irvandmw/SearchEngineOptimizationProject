Lyrics:


Oh oh oh
Welcome to the Panty Circus!
Oh oh oh
(Uh uh uh)
Oh oh oh
(Uh uh uh)
Ladies and gentlemen
Lady Gaga! (Gaga, Gaga)

Who's that girl runnin' round
With no clothes on, heels in the ground
Almost famous on the scene
She looks like a celebrity

Who's that girl, she's so shiny
Ain't no way her waist that tiny
Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care

Baby, shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties

Oh oh, I lost my clothes
But everybody knows
We get naughty
At the panty party

It's time to get undressed
And make it glamorous
Let's get naughty
At the panty party

Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

What are you doin' over there
We're gonna play in underwear
Spanky pants, curious
Bubble wrapper, furious

Who's that girl, she's so pretty
Bet you she's from New York City
Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care

Baby, shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties

Oh oh, I lost my clothes
But everybody knows
We get naughty
At the panty party

It's time to get undressed
And make it glamorous
Let's get naughty
At the panty party

Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby, shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties
Baby, shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties

Oh oh, I lost my clothes
But everybody knows
We get naughty
At the panty party

It's time to get undressed
And make it glamorous
Let's get naughty
At the panty party

Oh oh, I lost my clothes
But everybody knows
We get naughty
At the panty party

It's time to get undressed
And make it glamorous
Let's get naughty
At the panty party
