Lyrics:


Yeah

I'm from the Bronx, not Benny
I swear I don't even know why I did it
AP cost a hunnid and fifty
I be feeling like I'm drowning with it (Drowning with it)
(He be trying to ride the wave
You should be afraid that you don't drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
From the Bronx, not Benny yeah, yeah)
500K that's just on the Richie
My nigga you don't wanna play with my city
Niggas die everyday in my city
Whole lotta young, wild niggas
(He be trying to ride the wave
You should be afraid that you might drown in it)
I be feeling like the king of my city
And every nigga with me wearing Amiri

Headshot like POW! nigga
Headshot like pow nigga
Hit him twice make sure you don't miss him
Them bullets in this pistol look like a missile
Headshot like POW! nigga
Hit 'em up, man down, nigga
Send a nigga on a motherfucking mission
It's fucked up, yeah I know they gone miss him
I am not with it, yeah
Try to play with me you might end up missing
VVSs Elliot not missing
Sorry miss, these Elliot VVSs
Long johns on just for the Crips
Long johns on Crip we're tuckin'
If you gotta pay the bills fuck it
West side nigga
From the Bronx, yeah
Throw it up like LeBron, yeah
30 rounds on 100 and friends
All my guys came with the shits
And then we might get to bussin', yeah
If I like your necklace, yeah
Those guys might take off your necklace
Fuck a fight I ain't with the Tekken
Those guys might want you to check in

I'm from the Bronx, not Benny (yeah)
I swear I don't even know why I did it
AP cost a hunnid and fifty
(I be feeling like I'm drowning with it)
He be trying to ride the wave
You should be afraid that you don't drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
From the Bronx, not Benny Yeah, yeah
500K that's just on the Richie
My nigga you don't wanna play with my city
Niggas die everyday in my city
Whole lotta young, wild niggas
He be trying to ride the wave
You should be afraid that you might drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
And every nigga with me wearing Amiri
