Lyrics:


[Britney]
Yeah
Yeah
Would you rather I dim the lights
Would you prefer, just like we were
Or shall I undress for you (What do you want me to do)
However may I pleasure you

Fill with bubbles
Warm you a bath
Lay back relax
Anything you ask
Let me release the stress for you
However may I pleasure you

[Britney & Don Philip]
Youâre so perfect
That I get nervous
Tonight Iâm at your service
Iâm so unselfish
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure

[Chorus]
Youâre the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
Iâll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you
(Hey Britney, itâs Don Phillip)

[Don Philip]
Any fantasy can occur
Will be observed
Just say the word
Iâll do it if you want me to
Whatever just to pleasure you
If you wanna get off from that
Lay on your back
I got the max
Certainly Iâll pull you through
Whatever just to pleasure you

[Britney & Don Philip]
Youâre so perfect
That I get nervous
Tonight Iâm at your service
Iâm so unselfish
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure

[Chorus]
Youâre the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
Iâll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you

[Bridge]
If I
Pleasure
Together
Whatever
Whenever
Baby, with you

And itâs Like
Heaven
Together
No matter
Whatever
As long as you ask me too (what do you want me to do)

[Chorus]
Youâre the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
Iâll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you

Youâre the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
Iâll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you
