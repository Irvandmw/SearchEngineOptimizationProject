Lyrics:


I wanna paint it on every wall
And shout it out up and down the halls
I wanna post it in shining lights
âCause I just can't keep it bottled up inside

I wanna call up every single person I know
Write a song and play it on the radio
Stick a message in a bottle then I'll let it go
I don't care what people might think
I got your name in permanent ink
âCause baby this ship ain't never gonna sink

So kiss me
Like nobody's watching
Yeah people are talkinâ
It doesn't matter what they say
Just kiss me
In the middle of the streets
To let the whole world see
That thereâs nobody else for me

People around us are cynical
Go ahead and say that we're typical
True love is dead, well that's a lie
âCause we'll be together âtil the end of time

Now I'm burninâ up I'm speaking in tongues
Listen to my heart it's beating like a drum
I'm screaming your name at the top of my lungs
I don't care what people might think
I got your name in permanent ink
âCause baby this ship ain't never gonna sink
