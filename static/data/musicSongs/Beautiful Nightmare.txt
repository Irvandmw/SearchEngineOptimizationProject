Lyrics:


I can't let go
I'm addicted to your torture
I'm a prisoner to the pain
Although you're gone
All the misery remains

I do my best
Everyday just keeping busy
To avoid the ghost of you
But when I rest
There is nothing I can do

My eyes are closing and I'm scared
Cause I only dream of you
You're a beautiful nightmare
And nothing can wake me up from you

I gave you love
Gave you everything you asked for
And this is what I get
Your silence only fills my head with noise

I do my best
Everyday just keeping busy
To avoid the ghost of you
But when I rest
There is nothing I can do

My eyes are closing and I'm scared
Cause I only dream of you
You're a beautiful nightmare
And nothing can wake me up from you

Beautiful nightmare
Beautiful nightmare
You're a beautiful nightmare
You're a beautiful nightmare

Beautiful nightmare
Beautiful nightmare
You're a beautiful nightmare
You're a beautiful nightmare
