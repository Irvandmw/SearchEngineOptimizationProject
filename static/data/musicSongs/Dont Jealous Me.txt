You know me I no dey pretend
From start of the week to the weekend, ah

If you get on my ton ton ton
Me I want to get on your don don don
Zaga dat!

[Lord Afrixana:]
Sheep don't run with lion
Snake don't swing with monkey
I can't talk for too long
Got too much gold to try on
Sheep don't run with lion (Yeah)
Snake don't swing with monkey
I can't talk for too long
Got too much gold to try on

[Mr Eazi & (Yemi Alade):]

Don't you come for me (Jealousy)
