Lyrics:


You are the one drivin' me insane
Yes it's you, you're the one to blame
I'm in love forever
You say you'll never settle down
That you like to run around, but

I'll get you yet, I'll get you yet
I'll get you yet, just you wait and you see

You have those eyes, how they hypnotise
But I'm wise and I realise that you think
Well it's clever
My friends all warned me from the start
That you'd only break my heart, but

I'll get you yet, I'll get you yet
I'll get you yet, just you wait and you see

When I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
Now I feel this way
What more can I say pretty baby

You are the one drivin' me insane
Yes you are, you're the one to blame
I'm in love forever
You're rovin' days are over soon
Now you'll have to change your tune, but

I'll get you yet, I'll get you yet
I'll get you yet, just you wait and you see

When I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
Now I feel this way
What more can I say pretty baby

You are the one drivin' me insane
Yes you are, you're the one to blame
I'm in love forever
You're rovin' days are over soon
Now you'll have to change your tune, but

I'll get you yet, I'll get you yet
I'll get you yet, just you wait and you see
I'll get you yet, I'll get you yet
I'll get you yet, just you wait and you see
