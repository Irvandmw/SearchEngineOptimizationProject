Lyrics:


I know what we said
And every word was honest
But you wonât leave my head
And I canât keep my promise

Canât be away from you
Canât be away from you

I grieve for what is not
For every memory wasted
And I canât bear the thought
Of kisses left untasted

So, Iâm coming for you
Yeah, Iâm coming for you

Oooh, oooh, You make me wanna start over
You make me wanna start new
Forget the world we know
Baby donât look back
Letâs Just Go

I have longed for you
For ninety-seven sunsets
My heart knows what is true
And wonât have one more second of it

Canât be away from you
Wonât be away from you

Oooh, oooh, You make me wanna start over
You make me wanna start new
Forget the world we know
Baby donât look back
Letâs Just Go

And be together
And take the dare
And disappear into the air

Oooh, oooh, Yeah, I surrender
Say you surrender too
Forget the world we know
Baby donât look back
Letâs Just Go
