Lyrics:


Foreign skies
They've blinded me to empty charms
I crossed the ocean
Fell into your arms
So sure, so wrong
You sang me a simple tune
I took it for a song

Say goodbye
Don't tell me why you have to go
Loving you was as good as gold (as good as gold)
I'd to love you, really love you
But, you see, 
There's something you should know
I really didn't think you'd go

Because today
I could have sworn I heard you say
I love you
I want you
I need to be with you

Today
I saw something in your face
Stay here
Beside me
I need your love to hide me
You lied
And now you've gone away
And left me crying like a baby
