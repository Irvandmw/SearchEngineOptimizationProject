Lyrics:


Shut the light out
Come in close
Press against me and don't let go
No more talkin', no more words
We both know that they just don't work

I wanna be your only soldier
I wanna set your world alight

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Just stay, just stay
Wherever we are, let's be young hearts in the dark

No distractions, no alarms
Just you and I in a nervous calm
Kill the phone light, cut the cord
Bets are off, we don't share no more

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Just stay, just stay
Wherever we are, let's be young hearts in the dark

Don't blink and miss
No, we'll never know a life like this
Don't blink and miss
Did you ever know a life like
Did you ever know a life like this?

Don't say that you want me
Don't say you need me
Just stay, just stay
Wherever we are we'll be (young hearts in the dark)
Don't say that you want me
Don't say you need me
Just stay, just stay
Wherever we are we'll be (young hearts in the dark)
(Young hearts in the dark)
(Don't say you want me)
(Don't say you need me)

Kick the covers, drop the blinds
Lock the door so that no one finds us
