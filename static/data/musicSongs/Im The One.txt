Lyrics:


You see you're looking at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one yeah, I'm the one
Early morning and at dawn
Know you wanna ride now
I'm the one yeah, I'm the one yeah
I know you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate you
Know you're watching
Don't run out of time now
I'm the one yeah

Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh

'Cause I'm the one that hit the same spot
Sold out arenas but I do it in a tank top
Yeah, and see one hundred got that new drop
We're making records, breaking records off a laptop

Oh, feeling good when I wake up
Listen to Khaled when I'm putting on my makeup
Me and my mans would always fight and then we break up
So I moved on and put some zeros on my pay stubs

I lost some things then I found them
I got some day ones and I always stick around them
This summer droppin' and I know we gon' astound them
And plus I went and I put Quavo on the album

Looking at the truth
The money never lie no
I'm the one yeah, I'm the one
Early morning and at dawn
Know you wanna ride nah
I'm the one yeah, I'm the one yeah
I know you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate you
Know you're watching
Don't run out of time now
I'm the one yeah

Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh

Just got myself a baby blue Chanel
I use it twice despite the price then put it on the shelf
And when I roll up to the club no one can ever tell
Stay in the back so I can grab all on his Gucci belt

But we don't got no label
Don't really want bottles
Nothing in my nasal
Wanna keep it lowkey
Sneak under the table
DJ play The Weeknd
Tell me are you Abel
Okay though

Love, love, love, making love still
It's been a minute but he always get it rough still
He callin' asked if we can do it in the tub still
And so I pull up â brt-brt!

You know you're looking at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one yeah, I'm the one
Early morning and at dawn
Know you wanna ride now
I'm the one yeah, I'm the one yeah
I know you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate you
Know you're watching
Don't run out of time now
I'm the one yeah

Don't you know girl
Don't you know girl
I am the one for you

Don't you know girl
Don't you know girl
I am the one for you

Don't you know girl
Don't you know girl
I am the one for you

Don't you know girl
Don't you know girl
I am the one for you
