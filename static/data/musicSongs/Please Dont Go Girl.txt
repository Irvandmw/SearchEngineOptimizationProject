Lyrics:


We've been together for a long time, baby 
Do you have to leave? 
Please don't go girl 
I just can't live without you 
Please don't go girl 
So listen to me... (Don't go, girl) 
Please don't go girl 
You would ruin my whole world 
Tell me you'll stay 
Never ever go away 
I love you (I love you) 
I guess I always will 
Girl, you're my best friend 
Girl, you're my love within 
I just want you to know 
That I will always love you 
Ooh, baby 

Tell me you'll stay 
Never ever go away 
I need you (I need you) 
I guess I always will 
Girl, you're my best friend 
Girl, you're my love within 
I just want you to know 
That I will always love you 
Ooh, baby 

(Please don't go girl) 
I'm gonna always love you girl 
I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time 
Tell me girl 
You're gonna always be mine 

Please don't go girl 
You would ruin my whole world 
Tell me you'll stay 
Never ever go away 
I love you (I love you) 
I guess I always will 
Girl, you're my best friend 
Girl, you're my love within 
I just want you to know 
That I will always love you 
Ooh, baby 

(Please don't go girl) 
(Please don't go girl) 
Please don't go girl 
(Please don't go girl) 
Please don't go, baby 
(Please don't go girl) 
Please don't go girl 
(Please don't go girl) 
Please don't go darlin' 
(Please don't go girl) 
Please don't go, baby, no
