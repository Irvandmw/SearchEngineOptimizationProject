Lyrics:


Yes, this loveâs not good enough.
Itâs time to let it go.
Our weary hearts just fall apart.
I feel it in my bones.

And God knows that itâs hard to find the one,
But in time all the flowers turn to face the sun.

So silently, just walk with me,
Like any other day.
No sad goodbyes, no tears, no lies,
Just go our separate ways.

And God knows that itâs hard to find the one.
But in time all the flowers...
Yes, in time all the flowers turn to face the sun.

Yeah, you say what you say
Then you do it to me anyway
you do what you do
Then you walk away, you walk away
You say what you say
Then you do it to me anyway
you do what you do
Yeah, I know when it's through.

(won't you stay with me?)
And God knows that itâs hard to find the one.
(I know you won't stay with me)
But in time all the flowers...
(I know you won't stay with me)
Yes, in time all the flowers turn to face the sun.
