Song Name: Haters
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Dont spit on me and shame yourself
Because you wish you were someone else
You look so clean but you spread your dirt
As if think that words dont hurt
You build up walls no one can climb
The things you do should be a crime
You're queen of superficiality
Keep your lies out of my reality
And when you're nice it's just a pose
You're one of those

[Chorus]
Haters
Traitors to the human race
Haters
What a drag 
What a waste
I'd like to see them disappear
They dont belong anywhere
Haters

Spinning a web thats hard to see
Of envy, greed and jealousy
Feeling angry but you don't know why
Why dont you look me in the eye? 
You want my friends
You want my clothes
You're one of those

[Repeat Chorus]

Different life form
Different species
Broken promises and treaties
Talkin' bout exterminating
Not the haters
Just the hating
You say your boyfriend's sweet and kind
But you've still got your eyes on mine
Your best friend's got her eyes on yours
It all goes on behind closed doors
And when you're nice it's just a pose
You're one of those

[Repeat Chorus]

Haters
Later for the alibis
Haters
Any shape
Any size
I'd like to see them disappear
They dont belong anywhere
Haters
