Lyrics:


Get ready for the smack down 
Get ready for the smack down 
How ya gonna react 
When ya put on ya back now 
'Cause there's no turnin' back 
When you're facin' the smack down 

Come on, let's kick it, let's all get wicked 
Put your hands in the sky for a one-way ticket 
C'mon! 

Come on everybody, gonna start this party 
If we turn it to 11, the we can't go wrong 

And I'm not tryin' to tell you 
There won't be a lonely road 
When it all comes down 
You'll know just what to do 
Gonna burn this down 
And keep on runnin' 
'Till my time here is through 
'Cause when it all comes down 
I know just what to do 

Come on, let's rip it, let's push that limit 
If ya don't feel pain, that ya can't be winning 
C'mon! 

They said I wouldn't be nothin' 
I said stop frontin' 
Put the pedal to the metal 
'Cause the storm is comin'
