Lyrics:


We said good-bye in Marina Del Rey
"I had a good time" was the last thing
I heard her say, as I walked away
And on the plane back to Tennessee
My mind comes across her memory
And yesterday in Marina Del Rey

On a hidden beach, under a golden sun
She spread a blanket that we laid down on
And loved the world away in Marina Del Rey
And as we looked into each other's eyes
We found our bodies lost in paradise
Like castaways in Marina Del Rey

Like the ocean tides highs and lows
Love sometimes comes
And goes away in Marina Del Rey
And as this plane is touching down
Tears touch my eyes for I have found
My heart has stayed in Marina Del Rey

On a hidden beach, under a golden sun
She spread a blanket that we laid down on
And loved the world away in Marina Del Rey
And as we looked into each other's eyes
We found our bodies lost in paradise
Like castaways in Marina Del Rey

We said goodbye in Marina Del Rey
