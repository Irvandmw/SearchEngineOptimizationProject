Lyrics:


Oooh yeah
Get out (Get out)
We're gonna throw down, yeah (Throw down)
Get out (Get out)
Oh, we're gonna throw down (Oh, we're gonna throw down)

Oohoohoo, it's your thing, do what you wanna do
And I can't tell you who to sock it to
Said it's your thing (Thing, thing, thing)
Do what you wanna do with it now
I can't tell you who to sock it to

If you want me to love you, maybe I will
Believe me, baby, it ain't no big deal
Oh, you need love now, just as bad as I do
Makes me no difference, ah, who you give your stuff to

Oh, yeah, it's your thing (Thing, thing, thing)
Do what you wanna do with it
'Cause I can't tell you who to whip it to

It's your thing (Thing, thing, thing)
Do what you wanna do now
But I can't tell you who to whip it to

I'm not trying to run your life
I know you wanna, you wanna do what's right
Oh, give your love to whomever you choose
How can you lose with the stuff you use?

Oohoohoohoohoohoohoo (Thing, thing, thing)
Can not tell you, boy, boy, who to sock it to
Oooh, oh, it's your thing (Thing, thing, thing)
Do what you wanna do with it
I can't tell you who to sock it to

Oooh, it's your thing, do what you wanna do, boy
I said I can't tell you who to give it to

Get out (Get out)
Throw down (Throw down)
Get out (Get out)
Throw down (Oh, throw down)

It's your thing, it's your thing, it's your thing, really your thing
It's your thing, it's your thing, it's your thing, really your thing
It's your thing, it's your thing, it's your thing, really your thing
It's your thing, it's your thing, it's your thing, really your thing

It is your goody (It is)
Do what you want me to (It is)
'Cause I can't tell you (To, to, to)
Who to whip it to (who to sock it to)
Oh, yeah
