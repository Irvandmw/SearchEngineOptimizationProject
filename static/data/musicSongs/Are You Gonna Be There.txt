Lyrics:


If I was down
Would your arms lift me up to higher ground
With just the strength of your love
If I was lost
Would I find something in your eyes to lead me home 

And if it all went wrong
Would you be there to hold
Itâs easy to be there through the good times
But when the times get hard would you stay or walk away 

Are you gonna be there when the rain comes
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch
Can you swear youâll be there with a real love
Are you gonna be there

Will you stay by my side through the bad times
Through whatever will be, will you still be mine
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime
Are you gonna be there 

When I need someone to hold
Someone there for me
Are you gonna be there 

Be in my world if it should all fall down
Will you be there
Be there to turn it around
Will you still care
Can I depend on you to see me through this life 

And if it all goes wrong, will you still make it right
Itâs easy to be there through the good times
But when the times get hard 
Will you still be on my side 

Are you gonna be there when the rain comes
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch
Can you swear youâll be there with a real love
Are you gonna be there

Will you stay by my side through the bad times
Through whatever will be will you still be mine
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime
Are you gonna be there 

When I need someone beside me
Someone there for me
Are you gonna be 

There with the arms to hold me
There with the love I need
Will you be there
Heart and soul I need to know 

Are you gonna be there
Are you gonna still care
Are you gonna be, yeah
Will you stay by my side
Are you gonna be mine
Are you gonna be there 

Are you gonna be there when the rain comes
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch
Can you swear youâll be there with a real love
Are you gonna be there

Will you stay by my side through the bad times
Through whatever will be will you still be mine
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime
Are you gonna be there 

Are you gonna be there when the rain comes
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch
Can you swear youâll be there with a real love
Are you gonna be there

Will you stay by my side through the bad times
Through whatever will be will you still be mine
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime
Are you gonna be there
