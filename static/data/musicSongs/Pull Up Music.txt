Lyrics:


Let me get back on my hustle
Fuck a friend, it's off the muscle
You smoking dick, you think I trust you?
Burn a nigga like a [?] (boom)
I don't go back and forth all on the internet
Have no interest for discussion (no)
Pull her hair and choke her while we fucking
I prolly give her a concussion
I need a plate and I ain't tryna wait, I'm so fucking hungry I could starve
My nigga snuck in with the rod
I'm bout whatever, that's on God
I go to jail, I pay the bond
Please don't waste my fucking time
Hate on me I hit your hoe (hoe)
Play with me I get that iron
Can we fucking keep a secret?
That's a forty, bitch I keep it (boom)
My bitch a fucking Puerto Rican
I fuck her every other weekend
They swagger jacking, I can peep it
These nigga jacking my steelo
Bitch it's a brick, it's a kilo (brick)
I beat a nigga up like Deebo
His bitch got at me on the d-low (shh)
I'm wit my niggas shooting cee-lo
Wouldn't run up on me, that's a no go (brr)
I keep it on me like it's legal, bitch

They shoulda told you I'm coming
Nigga play with me, I mop it (it's up)
Pull up on me, think I'm bluffing?
Buss it on ya have ya running (brr)
Ya bitch can get it if she want it (oh yeah)
I'm killing ya bitch from the back, I smack her ass and keep her coming (hey)
All my nigga, they a hunnid
Police behind me, I'm running (I'm gone)
My hoe make your hoe look ugly
I don't do dimes, I do 20's (foreal)
20 thousand on a Monday (20)
30 thousand on a Tuesday
Caught ya bitch out on a Wednesday
She like my style, I had a choosing (uhh)
Sleep on me and then you losing
Got a beam on the chopper (boom)
Make you lean when I pop it
Got some lean from the doctor
Wherever you see me, I'm ready
My name a weight, this shit heavy
Got ya bitch face in my lap, parked at the 7/11
Yeah we at pump number nine
This ain't no pump, this a iron
They ain't let me in with the forty, snuck in the back with the 9
These nigga be acting and lying
Posting up statuses crying
There really really ain't no real niggas
And I'm bout to light the bih' line
Da Baby
