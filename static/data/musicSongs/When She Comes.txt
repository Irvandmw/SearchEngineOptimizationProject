Lyrics:


When she comes always unexpected
But never rejected surprise
Itâs always a shock when he undoes the lock
& sheâs there without a care

When she comes
The house is always a mess
Sheâs cool nevertheless & hereâs why
She remains as we say a sweet bird of prey
She flies & sheâs satisfied

When she comes
A lemoncello balletâ¦
A psychedelic cabaret in his mind
Without further adieu he takes off her shoes
& whatever confinesâ¦

When she comes
A blue bed of roses she never closes her eyes
4 his artful technique deserves a peek
Call it sublime cuz it happensâ¦

When she comes
So oh sweet the taste
The tears that roll down her face
Donât cry

Tho sad 1st site they r filled with delight
The 4th of July
When she comes
