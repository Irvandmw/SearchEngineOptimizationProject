Lyrics:


We had a dog named Bocephus? living in the front yard he liked sleeping out on the top of
the car he drank beer out of the mason jar and he'd climb up on everyone in bed

A white frame house, in a college town, a bunch of people always hanging around, no real
problems we need to drown but we tried our best anyway, we went to class just to pass the time
back in eighty nine

[Chorus:]
Keg in the closet pizza on the floor left over from the night before where
we were going we didn't really care we had all we ever wanted in that keg in the closet

This old guitar taught me how to score right there on the Lambda Chi porch, Mary Ann taught
me a little more 'bout wantin' what you cant have, sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in
panama, for a while we had it all we never dreamed it wouldn't last, we went to class just to
pass the time back in eighty nine

[Chorus]

We all kind of went our separate ways, but I swear it seems like yesterday

[Chorus]
