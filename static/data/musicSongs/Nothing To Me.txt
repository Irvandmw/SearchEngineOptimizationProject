Lyrics:


Where did our love go?
How could you know
You wasn't ready for me?
And I was so done, you never were the one
I waited hopelessly

For a man to come and save me
Not a boy who always plays me
Yeah you made me wanna believe it
But the truth is I don't need it

'Cause your love means nothing, your love means nothing to me
No your love means nothing, your love means nothing to me

Don't try to rewind
Don't try to change my mind
You know I've had enough
You gave me memories
But now you gotta leave
'Cause I needed more than your love

I need a man to come and save me
Not a boy who always plays me
You keep saying that you really care
So tell me why were you never there?

'Cause your love means nothing, your love means nothing to me
No your love means nothing, your love means nothing to me
What a waste of time, I don't know why
I could never see
That your love means nothing, your love means nothing to me

Love means nothing, your love means nothing to me
No your love means nothing, your love means nothing to me
What a waste of time, I don't know why
I could never see
That your love means nothing, your love means nothing to me
