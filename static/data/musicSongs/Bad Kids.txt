Lyrics:


We donât care what people say, we know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun.
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom.

Iâm a bitch, Iâm a loser baby maybe I should quit
Iâm a jerk, wish I had the money but I canât find work
Iâm a brat, Iâm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried until they got divorced âcause I ruined their lives

[Chorus]
Iâm a bad kid and I will survive
Oh Iâm a bad kid, donât know wrong from right
Iâm a bad kid and this is my life
One of the bad kids, donât know wrong from right
(This is my life)

Donât be insecure if your heart is pure
Youâre still good to me if youâre a bad kid baby
Donât be insecure if your heart is pure
Youâre still good to me if youâre a bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
(Donât be insecure)

Iâm a twit, degenerate young rebel and Iâm proud of it
Pump your fist if you would rather mess up than put up with this
Iâm a nerd, I chew gum and smoke in your face, Iâm absurd
Iâm so bad and I donât give a damn, I love it when youâre mad
When youâre mad, when youâre mad.

[Chorus]
Iâm a bad kid and I will survive
Oh Iâm a bad kid, donât know wrong from right
Iâm a bad kid and this is my life
One of the bad kids, donât know wrong from right
(This is my life)

Donât be insecure if your heart is pure
Youâre still good to me if youâre a bad kid baby
Donât be insecure if your heart is pure
Youâre still good to me if youâre a bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
(Don't be insecure)

Iâm not that typical baby
Iâm a bad kid like my mom and dad made me
Iâm not that cool and you hate me
Iâm a bad kid, thatâs the way that they made me

Iâm a bad kid Iâm disastrous
Give me your money or Iâll hold my breath
Iâm a bad kid and I will survive
One of the bad kids, donât know wrong from right

Donât be insecure if your heart is pure
Youâre still good to me if youâre a bad kid baby
Donât be insecure if your heart is pure
Youâre still good to me if youâre a bad kid baby
A bad kid baby

A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
