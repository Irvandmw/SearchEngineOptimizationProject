Lyrics:


I think I'm ready
I think I've got it
'Cause too much thinking is bad for my health
It's like a fire 'cause when I start it
I can't control it and I burn myself

But I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it no one will

We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one

My heart is racing, just like a rocket
Victory looks like a distant dream
'Cause what we're fighting's not gonna stop it
But we can beat it if we just believe
I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it no one will

We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one

We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one

We are the ones, we are the guns
We are
We are the change, we are the chains
We are
But I can't just sit here and watch it

If we don't stop it no one will

We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one

We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one
