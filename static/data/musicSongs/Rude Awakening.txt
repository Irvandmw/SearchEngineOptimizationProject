Lyrics:


Iâm just a pilot here, 
In things not always as they seem, 
Try a little bit harder now, 
Little bit harder than before, 
And I think that this might be 
The day that nobody, 
Nobody comes home, 
And I supposed to be 
A great day for a rude awakening 

Awaken yourself tonight. 
Open up your eyes, 
Thereâs no way to hide 
And awaken, 
âCause itâs alright, 
We could be anything, 
Yeah, we could be anything. 
And we are, 
All lined up when You're ready 
And we are, 
So much closer now. 
And we are, 
About to blow history wide open. 
And we will, 
Finally know the truth 
About You 
And I will wait for You, 
For all of eternity through, 
âCause I never been the same now 
Ever since You called out my name now 
Please, 
Take me as I am 
A simple man 
Taking my stand now 
Canât you feel it 
âCause itâs so real 
And itâs so reavealin' 

Awaken yourself tonight. 
Open up your eyes, 
Thereâs no way to hide 
And awaken, 
âCause itâs alright, 
We could be anything, 
Yeah, we could be anything. 
And we are, 
All lined up when You're ready 
And we are, 
So much closer now. 
And we are, 
About to blow history wide open. 
And we will, 
Finally know the truth 
About You 

Iâm just a pilot here, 
In things not always as they seem, 
Try a little bit harder now, 
Little bit harder than before, 
And I think that this might be 
The day that nobody, 
Nobody comes home, 
And I supposed to be 
A great day for a rude awakening 

Awaken yourself tonight. 
Open up your eyes, 
Thereâs no way to hide 
And awaken, 
âCause itâs alright, 
We could be anything, 
Yeah, we could be anything. 
And we are, 
All lined up when You're ready 
And we are, 
So much closer now. 
And we are, 
About to blow history wide open. 
And we will, 
Finally know the truth 
About You
