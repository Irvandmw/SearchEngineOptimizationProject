Song Name: Life As A Bullet
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


My mind has been shut down 
My friends have been let down 
What is the reason 
There's millions of reasons 

Single me out 
Tear off my front 
Make me expose what I conceal 

Life is a bullet 
The bloodstains prove it 
It's tearing through you and me 
Not caring about you or me 

Now I could explain everything 
You cursed the fire 
Now fuck the flame 
What is the reason 
There's millions of reasons 

Blindfold me now 
Spin me around 
Picking me up 
When I fall down 

Today I feel blue 
My head is in the clouds 
Separate me 
My soul from my body 

Feeling so lonely 
I'm not the only one 
Separate me 
My soul from my body 

I'm in love with too many things 
And I hate every thing
