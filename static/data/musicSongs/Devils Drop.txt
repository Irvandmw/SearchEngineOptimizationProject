Lyrics:


Landing in the Devil's drop
I walked out in the snow
And climbed up to the mountain top
A push from death below

Brother fell protecting us
Somewhere far from home
Lay him down to rest with us
In fields of earth and coal

Sailing out away from this
To ports of foreign shores
Let us not forget to miss
The ones we cannot hold

Landing in the Devil's drop
I walked out in the snow
And climbed up to the mountain top
A push from death below

Brother fell protecting us
Somewhere far from home
Lay him down to rest with us
In fields of earth and coal
