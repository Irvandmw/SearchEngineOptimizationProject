Lyrics:


When the pressure's all around me
I try to drown it out
With that sweet ukelele
I'm jammin' to my molly
That's what life's all about

My favorite piece, a melody
When things are going wrong
To pick me up or calm down
I need my favorite song
Nothing else could comfort my soul, hey

Oh oh, I could be fine alone
With me and my headphones
Oh oh, they wonder why I'm smiling so
With me and my headphones
Cause I play my music real loud
I block out on every sound
Oh oh, I could be fine alone
With me and my headphones

And when I'm flying out to LA
In the skies above
I love to listen to that new beat
Tappin' with my two feet
I can't get enough

Cause my favorite piece, a melody
When things are going wrong
To pick me up or calm me down
I need my favorite song
Nothing else could comfort my soul, hey

Oh oh, I could be fine alone
With me and my headphones
Oh oh, they wonder why I'm smiling so
With me and my headphones
I play my music real loud
I block out on every sound
Oh oh, I could be fine alone
With me and my headphones

Hey-ey-ey-ey
Me and my headphones
No, yeah
Louder and louder
Put my music up
Louder and louder
Let this beat drop
Louder and louder
Wanna hear again
Louder and louder

Oh oh, I could be fine alone
With me and my headphones
Oh oh, they wonder why I'm smiling so
With me and my headphones
I play my music real loud
I block out on every sound
Oh oh, I could be fine alone
With me and my headphones
Oh oh, I could be fine alone
With me and my headphones
Oh oh, they wonder why I'm smiling so
With me and my headphones
I play my music real loud
I block out on every sound
Oh oh, I could be fine alone
With me and my headphones
