Lyrics:


I promised to love and cherish you
for as long as we both shall live
I'm left with an echo of "I do"

It doesn't seam so far away
I remember the promise we made
Still hear an echo of "I do"

[Chorus:]
Cause you will always be a part of me
I keep you in my heart
And a piece of me will always be
right there by your side

Now that you've found somebody new
and Gods knows I'm happy for you
don't you hear an echo of "I do"?

I've tried to erase you from my mind
It keeps me awake at night
hunted by echoes of "I do"

Cause you will always be a part of me
I keep you in my heart
And a piece of me will always be
right there by your side

Who do you turn to when your sad
who can replace the love we had
How do you make it through the night
when I am no longer by your side
If you ever need me I'll be there

[Chorus:]
Cause you will always be a part of me
I keep you in my heart
And a piece of me will always be
right there by your side
