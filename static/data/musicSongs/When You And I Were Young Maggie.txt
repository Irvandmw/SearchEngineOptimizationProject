Lyrics:


(the green grove is gone from the hill, maggie,
Where first the daisies sprung!)

I wandered today to the hill, maggie,
To watch the scene below,
The creek and the creakin' old mill, maggie,
As we used to do long ago!

The green grove is gone from the hill, maggie,
Where first the daisies sprung...

The creakin' old mill is still, maggie,
Since you and I were young!

The green grove is gone from the hill, maggie,
Where first the daisies sprung,
The creakin' old mill is still, maggie,
Since you and I were young,

Since you and I were young,
Since you and I were young!
