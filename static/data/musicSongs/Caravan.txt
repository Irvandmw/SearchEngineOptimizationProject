Lyrics:


Night And Stars Above That Shine So Bright
The Mystery Of Their Fading Light
That Shines Upon Our Caravan.

Sleep Upon My Shoulder As We Creep
Across The Sands So I May Keep
The Mem'ry Of Our Caravan.

This Is So Exciting, You Are So Inviting
Resting In My Arms
Thrill To The Magic, The Magic Of Your Charms

You Beside Me Here Beneath The Blue
My Dream Of Love Is Coming True
Within Our Desert Caravan.

This Is So Exciting, You Are So Inviting
Resting In My Arms
Thrill To The Magic, The Magic Of Your Charms

Night And Stars Above That Shine So Bright
The Mystery Of Their Fading Light
That Shines Upon Our Caravan.
