I'm the trillest of the trill..You the fakest of the fake

[Chamillionaire - Talking (Pimp-C)]
Chamillitary man..(I'm the trillest of the trill..You the fakest of the fake)
Know what I'm talkin' bout..It's Color Changin' Click clack and uhh (I'm the
trillest of the trill..You the fakest of the fake)
Tuned in to the Mixtape Messiah, know what I'm talkin' bout, (I'm the
trillest of the trill..You the fakest of the fake)
but uhh, we got somebody else who wanna say sumthin' (I'm the trillest of the

talkin' bout?
(I'm the trillest of the trill..You the fakest of the fake)

It's Rasaq boy!

[Chorus - Rasaq]
I'ma drag em' in the river, drop his body in the bay
With a note around his throat and you know what it say (It's Rasaq Boy)
Ohh! you want some..you's a hoe Dike Jones
You's a hoe Dike Jones, you's a hoe
From the 4 and I don't give a shit
Color Changin' Click in this bitch represent who you with

[Verse - Rasaq]
I'm on 4's, suicide doors
Searchin' through the city for this hoe Dike Jones (where they at?)
Take a shot of drank, just to get me in the zone (in the zone)
I know you see me comin' better strap up ya thong (strap up ya thong)
I heard you bumpin' gums, so you better get gone
Don't let this pistol handle come on top of yo dome (yo dome)
Ridin' 2 tone, grippin' styrofoam
It's the boy Rasaq puttin' it down for Akers Home (wussup baby)
Niggaz know ya fraud, don't make me pull ya card
Tryna play it hard, but I caught ya off guard
They say we fell off, what they didn't tell yall
To get a meal all I need to do was make a cell call
They say we fell off, what they didn't tell yall
To get a meal all I need to do was make a cell call

[Chorus - Rasaq]
I'ma drag em' in the river, drop his body in the bay
With a note around his throat and you know what it say
Ohh! you want some..you's a hoe Dike Jones
You's a hoe Dike Jones, you's a hoe
From the 4 and I don't give a shit
Color Changin' Click in this bitch represent who you with

I'm the trillest of the trill..You the fakest of the fake

I'm the trillest of the trill..You the fakest of the fake -
I ride with made niggaz them choppin' on blades niggaz
I'm the trillest of the trill..You the fakest of the fake
