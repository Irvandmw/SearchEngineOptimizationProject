Lyrics:


Goyard on, pick out what you want
HermÃ¨s on, pick out what you want
New Chanel, oh, pick out what you want
(DJ Esco)
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags

What the fuck is you talkin' bout, I can get ya ass hit
Hop out a Corvette nigga, then gon' smash ya bitch
I got an American Roadster, I'm gonna hit me a lick
Sippin' on 'Tussin, fuckin' and hustlin'
I bet I'm gon' floss, hate it or love it
A full grown boss, hate it or love it
Dope boy shoppin' at Walters, I bought the whole store
Fuck boy doin' that talkin', that's my old hoe
Stars inside the ceiling, I'm on go go
You don't want no war, nigga, oh no, oh no
Codeine floodin' Atlanta, bitch ass niggas with hammers
Bitch ass niggas in Pampers, fuck around murk his mama
My young niggas don't play, fuck around kill you in sandals
I was on some cool shit now they want the hammer

King Joffy Jo
My body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God

I been poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags

I came here to purchase, I ain't worried 'bout a ticket
Bitch you on that G-Wagon, go muthafckin' get it
I had on my ski mask in the muthafckin' trenches
Homie Blood talkin', is you muthafckin' Crippin'
I get the plug talkin' 'bout these muthafckin' chickens
Put up some lean before they can lean
I'm runnin' right through a machine
I'm 'bout to lose the roof, they tryna steal the juice
Cuban hangin' on my neck whip, gon' cruise
I just copped the coupe 63's with the Forgi's
Bought a couple 'Raris and I bought a couple Porsches
Zone Six fuck shit, finessin' and extortin'
Twenty diamond chains and got several different choices

King Joffy Jo
My body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God

I been poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags

Goyard, oh, pick out what you want
HermÃ¨s on, pick out what you want
New Chanel, oh, pick out what you want
Catch me goin' goon
Smashin' on a womb
Fuck your baby daddy
Smash you on the Xanny
Iced out Codeine
Got you in your feelin's
Just to get you feelin'
Spend a couple million
Like I'm Godzilla in the rollie store
We just got the pack in from Mexico
Soon as it touch down I'm goin' ape
Put it on the hood like you claim Grapes
Pull up in the food in a new Wraith

King Joffy Jo
My body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God

I been poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags

Pick out what you want
Pick out what you want
Pick out what you want
Pick out what you want
Pick out what you want
