Lyrics:


Kaie a ahou
Kay kalli nei
Ahee ah ee aha
Cou alhoa!

This is the moment of sweet aloha!
I will love you longer than forever,
Promise me that you will leave me never...
Here and now dear,
All my love I vow dear,
Promise me that you will leave me never,
I will love you longer than forever!
Now that we are one (my darling)
Clouds won't hide the sun (my love)
Blue skies of hawaii,
Smile on this our wedding day!
I do (I do)
Love you (love you)
With all my heart!
