Lyrics:


I came in from the outside, burnt out from a joyride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is Stella by Starlight
That was my heart, the drums that start off night and day

The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

Tell me who and I'll be thanking 'em
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing?
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing

I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

The very thought of you and am I blue
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh the radio newsreader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me, awake, and ask, 'Is everything alright?'

And, Lord, I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
