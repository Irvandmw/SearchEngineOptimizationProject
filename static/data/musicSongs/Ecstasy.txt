Lyrics:


The magic of your kiss is holding you like this is ecstasy (ecstasy)
The love that you have given makes this life I'm livin' ecstasy (ecstasy)
Never let me go, let that love light show
Ah.. take me by the hand and lead me to the land of ecstasy (ecstasy)

The first time that I saw you, you showed me the door to ecstasy (ecstasy)
Now I just keep prayin' that you're always thinkin' ecstasy (ecstasy)
Oh, but don't you go away for a single day
Come on and take me by the hand and lead me to the land of ecstasy (ecstasy)

Travel up and down much never have I found such ecstasy (ecstasy)
Now dear that I know you every where I go thru ecstasy (ecstasy)
Kiss me dear and then.. oh, kiss me once again
Come on and take me by the hand and lead me to the land of ecstasy (ecstasy)

Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Baby, baby, baby...
