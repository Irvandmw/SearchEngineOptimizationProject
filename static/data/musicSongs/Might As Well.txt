Lyrics:


So I ain't have to scheme
Rawest diamonds on my team (bet)
Raw diamonds on lean (hey)
I took off just like a rocket (I'm gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Either way it goes
We buyin' out the stores (for real)
We ain't never runnin' out of lean, (never)
Might as well go on 'n pour it (pour)
Racks bustin' out of niggas' jeans (fuck)
Might as well go and blow it (fact)
Smoke the loud like nicotine (smoke)
Talk drugs and I record it
Conversate and I absorb it (I got it)
Theodore, no informant
Percocets got me goin'
OG, coughing up a lung

They got our streets, tried to tell ya (bitch)
It's already been done (I got it)
Ammunition overflowin' (I got it)
Tears fillin' up upon
AC blowin' like it's snowin' (let's get it)
I know I'm bliss, I speak in tongues (you bet it)
My words touch a nigga soul
They get you through it, overcome
I ride the boats in the ocean
I whipped the car, it was stolen
I got the stars on the ceiling
I got my charge acquitted
I was the one got evicted, yeah
Living with the pink slip
Now I'm riding 'round with the pink slip
I done swam with the sharks
Nigga came from the deep end
You will never know what I was in
Times are getting rough, we still get in
I was selling crack when Snoop dropped "Juice and Gin" (yah yah)
Run a one room shack with a million in the den (fact)

Rawest diamonds on my team (bet)
Raw diamonds on lean (hey)
I took off just like a rocket (I'm gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Either way it goes
We buyin' out the stores (for real)
We ain't never runnin' out of lean, (never)
Might as well go on 'n pour it (pour)
Racks bustin' out of niggas' jeans (fuck)
Might as well go and blow it (fact)
Smoke the loud like nicotine (smoke)
Talk drugs and I record it
Conversate and I absorb it (I got it)
Theodore, no informant
Percocets got me goin'
OG, coughing up a lung

Workaholic
A few supermodels color
Ain't gonna expose ya
Can't say I ain't think about it (fact)
(Can't say I ain't think about it)
Pink diamonds, no blinking
Niggas got no dripping
Started off on a mission
I got real niggas still crippin'
Child support gettin' heavy
It's hard not to get offended
Oh, you maxin' out your credit card?
Like it wasn't hard for me
I just bought a new Bugatti for you

So I ain't have to scheme
Rawest diamonds on my team (bet)
Raw diamonds on lean (hey)
I took off just like a rocket (I'm gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Either way it goes
We buyin' out the stores (for real)
We ain't never runnin' out of lean, (never)
Might as well go on 'n pour it (pour)
Racks bustin' out of niggas' jeans (fuck)
Might as well go and blow it (fact)
Smoke the loud like nicotine (smoke)
Talk drugs and I record it
Conversate and I absorb it (I got it)
Theodore, no informant
Percocets got me goin'
OG, coughing up a lung

Lived in it all
Gotta take a trip and go ball (I gotta take a trip)
Packin' the luggage I'm gonna get down by tomorrow
Get down by tomorrow
And packin' the luggage so I get down by tomorrow

So I ain't have to scheme
Rawest diamonds on my team (bet)
Raw diamonds on lean (hey)
I took off just like a rocket (I'm gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Either way it goes
We buyin' out the stores (for real)
We ain't never runnin' out of lean, (never)
Might as well go on 'n pour it (pour)
