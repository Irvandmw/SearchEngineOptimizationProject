Lyrics:


Everybody sings the blues sometimes everybody knows the tune
Yeah everybody knows the way I'm feeling cause everybody's had the blues

A lonely song someone is gone a story old as time
Love hate or want and wait till mis'ry fills your mind
Everybody knows the way I'm feeling cause everybody's had the blues

A lonely song someone is gone...
