Lyrics:


[Shawn Mendes:]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know

When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Leon Bridges:]
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh

[Shawn Mendes & Leon Bridges:]
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want

I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

I pretend that (pretending like I'm not)
I'm not ready (I'm pretending like I mean)
Why do we put each other through hell? (Yeah, yeah)
Why can't we just get over ourselves? (Why, why, why)
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Shawn Mendes:]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you
