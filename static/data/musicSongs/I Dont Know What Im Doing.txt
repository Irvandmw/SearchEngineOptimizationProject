Lyrics:


(I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time)

When the party is over and the laughter is through
And the last song stops playing I'll be thinking of you
For there's such a sweet mem'ry when you're crossing my mind
I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time

I don't know what I'm doing with this drink in my hand
Guess I just gone to pieces like a ship on the sand
Your sweet name I keep calling while you jumble my mind
I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time
(I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time)

I may never find sunshine if I'd never find you
So I'll search all the places where the lights burning blue
Oh you just might be lonesome when I'm fooling my mind
I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time
I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time
