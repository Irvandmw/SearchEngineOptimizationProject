Lyrics:


I am at peace in darkness now
I've seen the light, it showed me how
All of my thoughts become my path
And I am limitless at last

Love is broken and opened my heart
And it is always just the start

All of my life
Holding on too tight
Now I must let go
I'll spend the rest of my life
So much left in it
Just let go

We are all running out of time
But the universe is mine
Under a blood moon or a sun
I know that I've only begun

And for every sad goodbye
There will be a sweet surprise

All of my life
Holding on too tight
Now I must let go
I'll spend the rest of my life
So much left in it
Just let go

Breathe in
Breathe out
There's only now
My dreams
My path
Limitless at last

And for every sad goodbye
There will be a sweet surprise

All of my life
Holding on too tight
Now I must let go
(Must let go)
I'll spend the rest of my life
So much left in it
Just let go
(Yeah, yeah)

Breathe in (breathe in)
Breathe out (breath out)
There's only now (now)
My dreams (my dream)
My path (my path)
Limitless at last (yeah, yeah)
