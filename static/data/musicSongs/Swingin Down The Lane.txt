Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Everybody hand-in-hand, swingin' down the lane, 
Everybody feelin' grand, swingin' down the lane, 
That's the time I miss the bliss, that we might have known, 
Nights like this, when I'm all alone! 

When the moon is on the rise, 'Honey' I'm so blue, 
Watchin' lovers making eyes, like we used to do, 
When the moon is on the wane, still I'm waitin' all in vain, 
Should be swingin' down the lane with you! 

[instrumental break "trumpet solo"]

When the moon is on the rise, 'Honey' I'm so blue, 
Watchin' lovers making eyes, like we used to do, 
When the moon is on the wane, still I'm waitin' all in vain, 
Should be swingin' down the lane with you!
