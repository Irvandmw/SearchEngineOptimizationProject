Lyrics:


Bind (bind) my limbs with fear (fear)
Choke me with tears (tears)
Wont die for you
You've (you've) been here before (before)
And come back for more (more)
Not this time

You will never be strong enough
You will never be good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie
Should have known it was all a lie

Now, (now) I know the truth (truth)
I'm through fearing you (you)
I am free

You will never be strong enough
You will never be good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie
I should have known it was all a lie

Ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you (I should have known it was all a lie)
Should have known it was all a lie

I should have known it was all a lie
