Lyrics:


Countin' the bands, countin' the digits
All of us start, now all of us livin' (All of us livin', yeah)
I pimped out my ride, call me Xzibit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I am a man from humble beginnings
I start to try but it's callin' rigid (Brr)
You won't be caught if they catch you slippin' (No no no)
Family back home, my family I'm missin' (Family I'm missin', yeah)
They livin' good like they gettin' commission
They gettin' commission, oh yeah
Yeah, I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' right
Stop smokin' weed but I'm takin' a drag
Think of my pops and where we was at
Whippin' the 'gram, it's all that we have
Place-to-pace, facin' the vision
I was like Raven, man, I had the vision
Picture me here, I picture me winnin'
Now I'm in the top floor, I'm smilin', I'm grinnin'

Can't believe that we made it
Can't believe that we made it
We was broke, we was breaking
Now I'm here and I'm staying
Can't believe that we made it
Can't believe that we made it
We was broke, we was breaking
Now I'm here and I'm...

Countin' the bands, countin' the digits
Wasn't born rich, wasn't born privileged
Lebanese blood, I was born ambitious (I was born ambitious)
My pops told me, if you want it, go get it, you gotta go get it, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, I been goin' hard, stay hot like the summer
You know I take my chance, I might never get another
Blinded to the hate, like my name be Stevie Wonder
Do it for the fam and my fans and my brothers
Remember Cherry Hill, couldn't sit down on the bus
Santa kept me goin' like a voice from above
Knew that I was destined, man, I knew that I was touched
In my head was conversations that I knew should be discussed
Jump like seven years, now I'm turnin' to a star
Livin' in my dream, and man, I bought my dream car
Realizin' that nothin' doesn't make you who you are
'Cause money buys us ownership so we'll all be scars
Damn, money buys us ownership so we'll all be scars
Grateful for it all but my wealth is in my heart
When they tell me that I made it, thought I made it from the start

Can't believe that we made it (I can't believe, can't believe)
Can't believe that we made it (I can't believe)
We was broke, we was breaking (Breaking, breaking)
Now I'm here and I'm staying
Can't believe that we made it (Yeah, yeah)
Can't believe that we made it (I can't believe, I can't believe)
We was broke, we was breaking (I can't believe)
Now I'm here and I'm...
