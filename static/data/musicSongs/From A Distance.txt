Lyrics:


Oh I hate to love you
Love you from a distance
And everytime you write
I kiss your name

Oh I hate to love you
Love you from a distance
And loving you this way
Seems all in vain

Holding you in my dreams
Isn't quite the same it seems
I love you, but it's hard to do
From a thousand miles away

Oh I hate to love you
Love you from a distance
Just to kiss your lips
Is all I pray

Holding you in my dreams
Isn't quite the same it seems
I love you, but it's hard to do
From a thousand miles away

Well I'm gonna love you
but not from a distance
I'm comin' home to you
I'm gonna stay

Yes I'm gonna love you
But not from a distance
And when I hold you near
You'll hear me say
