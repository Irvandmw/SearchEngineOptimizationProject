Lyrics:


I went to London town
Then on to Paris for the fun I could find
I've found I couldn't leave my memories behind
Where can I go without you

Tries seeing Singapore but that wouldn't do
Went to Vienna but I found you there too
Even in Switzerland your memory came through
Where can I go without you

I want to travel I wanted romance
I chased that rainbow across the sea
I'm tired of faces and quaint old places
If you can't be there with me

Back on that boat again and farewell to France
Farewell to London town they haven't a chance
I'll trade the sights I've seen for one loving glance
Where can I go without you

Back on the boat again farewell to France
Farewell to London town they haven't a chance
I'll trade the sights I've seen for one loving glance
Where can I go
Where can I go
Where can I go without you
