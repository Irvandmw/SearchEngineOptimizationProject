Lyrics:


This one ain't for baby, this is for the Juice Crew
This is for them bitches that thought I had a loose screw
Motherfuck them haters, ain't tryna keep it neutral
Standin' at a bulletproof glass, had to shoot through
Hopin' that they shoot through
Don't make me put my hands on niggas, keep it Bluetooth
This is what you're used to, this life I ain't new to
I ain't tryna keep it neutral

And I fuck it all up, and I fucked it all up
And I fuck it all up, and I fucked it all up

And we all want trophies, she want a nigga next to her
Pull up when he flex to her even though she lonely
She look pretty (I swear)
She's too pretty (I swear)
Trophies, she have you waitin' there on both knees
She want a nigga that'll make her really feel pretty
And she don't feel pretty
Don't feel pretty

This one here for Ashley, and this is just the truth-truth
Always datin' losers, losin' never suits you
Stackin' up the paper, savin' up the susu
Mama, please forgive me, this life will pollute you, yeah
Girl, I know, all on the rebound
Great deep throat, a shallow bitch deep down
Pissin' on the tape but never put the seat down
And I never fuck it up, but

And I fuck it all up, and I fucked it all up
And I fuck it all up, and I fucked it all up

And we all want trophies, she want a nigga next to her
Pull up when he flex to her even though she lonely
She look pretty
She's too pretty
Trophies, she have you waitin' there on both knees
She want a nigga that'll make her really feel pretty
And she don't feel pretty
Don't feel pretty

Girl, I know, all on the rebound
Tell her go slow, fell in love in the speed round
Good soul that's a tragedy deep down
Club closed, but she doesn't want sleep now
And we all forget our bonds
Hard to tell when we're both this young
Silk or leather, we're both pullin' stones
Inhale 'til we're both numb

And we all want trophies, she want a nigga next to her
Pull up when he flex to her even though she lonely
She look pretty
She's too pretty
Trophies, she have you waitin' there on both knees
She want a nigga that'll make her really feel pretty
And she don't feel pretty
Don't feel pretty
