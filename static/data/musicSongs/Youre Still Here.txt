Song Name: You're Still Here
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Mercury dances in its skyscraper cell
Rising and falling like rhapsody
And I see winter broken like lace
In time for a celebration

Thaw wails inside the walls and laughs in the corners
Delighting in its evident victory
Till I feel springtime counting its days
Of flaunting a novel sensation

Like it's leaving, leaving behind
The weight vying for yesteryear
Leaving promises in its wake
Whispering, my love, you're still here
You're still here

Hold on to your memories of sundogs and rainbows
As time writes a premature eulogy
And I feel summertime passing in haste
Like running out of patience

Quilted with knit and umbrellas and scarfs
And a mild understanding of irony
I feel autumn leaving the race
All done with the exhilaration

It's leaving, leaving behind
The weight vying for yesteryear
Leaving promises in its wake
Whispering, my love, you're still here
You're still here

Mercury dances in its skyscraper cell
Rising and falling in harmony
And I feel winter stealing my days
To herald another creation
