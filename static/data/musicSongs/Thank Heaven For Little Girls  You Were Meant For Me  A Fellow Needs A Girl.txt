Lyrics:


Sing to me, Mr. C., sing to me 
the song that I've been waiting to hear, 
just for me, Mr. C., just for me, 
and everybody else will disappear... 

Thank heaven for little girls 
for little girls get bigger every day! 

Thank heaven for little girls 
they grow up in the most delightful way! 

Those little eyes so helpless and appealing 
one day will flash and send you crashin' thru the ceilin' 

Thank heaven for little girls 
thank heaven for them all, 
no matter where no matter who 
for without them, what would little boys do? 

[instrumental break]

Thank heaven... thank heaven... 
Thank heaven for little girls! 

You were meant for me 
I was meant for you! 
Nature patterned you, an' when she was done 
you were all the sweet things rolled in one! 

You're like a plaintive melody 
that never lets me free 
I'm content, the angels must have sent you 
and they meant you just for me! 

You... 
were... 
meant... 
for me! 

I... 

was... 
meant... 
for you! 

I'm content, 
the angels must have sent you 
and they meant you 
just for me! 

A fella needs a girl, to sit by his side 
At the end of a weary day 
To sit by his side and listen to him talk 
And agree with the things he'll say! 

A fella needs a girl, to hold in his arms 
When the rest of the world goes wrong 
To hold in his arms and know that she believes 
That her fella is wise an' strong! 

When things go right and his job's well done 
He wants to share the prize he's won 
If no one shares, no one cares 
Where's the fun of a job well done, or a prize you've won? 

A fella needs a home, his own kind of home 
But to make his dream come true 
A fella needs a girl, his own kind of girl 
My kind of girl is you! 

[instrumental break]

A fella needs a girl, his own kind of girl 
My kind of girl is you!
