Lyrics:


You made me breakfast every morning
You made me sleep all through the night
You made me worry without any warning
Let me just lie here, drown in your eyes, dear

You made me sorry but this wasn't always
You made me hungry for your body, babe
You made me run down hospital hallways
You gave me life, dear, and he's got your eyes

I waited so long
Baby, I did you wrong
Let's make up for the time we've wasted
You would wait by the phone
Every time I was gone
But all along 

You are everything
I have never been
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering
Why you let me in
I want you to make me better

You made me stop and savor the moment
You made me laugh out loud, you do
You give me memories like time is frozen
You gave me a child and he's got your smile

And I sang a song
Every night I was gone
About all the dreams I'm chasing
And I have been wrong
With the things that I've done
'Cause all along

You are everything
I have never been
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering
Why you let me in
I want you to make me better

Although that I've never read your mind
I figured it out on my own
I am so glad that I've caught you in time
Before I am left all alone, alone

You are everything
I have never been
I want you to make me better
So please, my darling
Take this wedding ring
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering
Why you ever let me in
I want you to make me better
I want you to make me better
I want you to make me better
