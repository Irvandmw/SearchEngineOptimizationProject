Lyrics:


Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens

First verse, okay so what I got here is I got Chris Salih
You guys remember him he used to be the drummer of twenty one pilots
He's got a verse for ya, let's hear it out
1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4

Standing on stage singing with my frens
It's great to be back up here with you guys again
Something something something something something
I've beenâohâyeah that's good
Let's do it again! Here we go
1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4

I wrote it down

Glad to be back here on stage again
Singing this song with all my frens
It seems like I've been gone so long
But I really haven't been gone that longâ¦ um

I'm glad 'cause these jackets are really lame
You guys think that's really your ticket to fame?
I had to quit the band for other things, but that's kinda depressing
So let's all sing!

Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens
Let's sing it again, c'mon you can do it!
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens

Alright so this next guy, we got Mark
I told you about him already
He's uhâI've had the privilege of staying up late with him and really uh get to know him
He's a real profound guy
He thinks very deeply about what he believes
He's a really really good writer
If you could pay attention to these words, they're so awesome
They just penetrate the soul and the heart
Here we go
1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4

Waka baka buka doka buka noka me
Waka laka waka laka waka laka you
Snowboarding in Hawaii
Surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, Hawaii, (yep) Hawaii (Hawaii)
This song sounds like somethingâagain to the chorus

Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens

Alright this next guy is our last round
He's my other roommate
His name is Josh
He has nothing to do with this band at all, but I promised him that he can get up on stage
So this is what we got
1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4

My name is Josh and you don't know who I am
But I live with these guys and their really stupid band
But my breath fogged up the glass
So I drew a face and I laughed
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm yours
To the chorus!

Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens
We're doing it one more time, ready?
Let's make it count
Here we go
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens

Thank you!
