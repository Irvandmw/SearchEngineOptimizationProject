Lyrics:


If all I have is now
No consequences
Would I go touch the flame?
Or would I run for the exit?
I've fought this all my life
The blood's shedding like never before
But I finally see your face
It's just a mirror looking back at me 
And my reflection is all I see

I don't wanna finish what we started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are â who the devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not a slave to your temptation
Cause I know who you are and who the devil is

There's nowhere safe to hide
I can feel your presence
But we've been waging war
Since you fell from the heavens
I've fought this every night
Feels like I've already been here before
Where I'm looking into your eyes 
And my reflection's looking back at me 
And the devil is all I see

I don't wanna finish what we started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are â who the devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not a slave to your temptation
Cause I know who you are and who the devil is

I had enough of you cause you took enough away from me 
The lies I lived became everything I believed
But the truth is that the devil in you is me
The devil in you is me
The devil in you is me

I don't wanna finish what we started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are â who the devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not a slave to your temptation
Cause I know who you are and who the devil is
