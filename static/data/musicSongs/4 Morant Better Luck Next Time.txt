Lyrics:


(The beach is a good place to pick up girls because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are full of chicks
And they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're)

Hm, mm, mm
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass in the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, I have flashed from the genesis
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends are pretend
Wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna send shit
Ends with a sniff, or a huff, or injection
I can't handle rejection
Can't stand my reflection, damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind and remind that I'm weak?
So I fall behind every week?
I'm too shy when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the street to the gutters to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep, I say "Mother never weep"
My brother finds blood, I say "Shut up 'fore she sees"
Another motherfucking trap
W-wonder when she weeps, w-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth, spit natural disasters
God told me, "Cat, don't mess with the past tense"
You're testing the masters, so guess what the fact is
My ex is a bachelor
Next, can they get big checks from the sets?
Next, from the dancers
Text from the models, this Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles

I swear on my life I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh

Better luck next time
Better-better-better luck next time
Better luck next time (Next time)
Better-better-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Bet-bet, bet-bet
Bet-bet, bet-bet
