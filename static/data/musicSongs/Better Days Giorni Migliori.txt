Lyrics:


Oh, I know that there'll be better days
Oh, that sunshine 'bout to come my way
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days

Apro gli occhi e sono a Roma
Tu sai dirmi in che anno sei?
Ogni giorno si va tutti in scena
In un film che non parte mai
Dai balconi un pezzo di noi
Racconta che fai
Racconta chi sei
E non si muove piÃ¹ una foglia
Chiudo gli occhi e penso a lei

Oh, I know that there'll be better days
Oh, that sunshine 'bout to come my way
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days

Been wakin up to a new year (Sono sveglio giÃ  da un giorno)
Got the past million miles away (In che anno sei?)
I'm waking up with a new fear (La paura che io sento)
But I know it'll wash away
Whatever you do, don't worry 'bout me
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, don't worry 'bout us
'Cause in the morning everything can change, yeah
And time will tell you it does

Oh, I know that there'll be better days
Oh, that sunshine 'bout to come my way
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days

Better days, better days
Better days, better days

May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days
