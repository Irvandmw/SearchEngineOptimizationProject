Lyrics:


Bessie couldnât help it
Bessie couldnât help it

Bessie couldnât help it any more
Than you could or I could
Bessie couldnât help it though she tried to be good
Oh, so good

She was pretty as the heaven's above
Oh, boy but how she could love
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful, terrible
But Bessie couldnât help it any more
Than you could or I could

When she smiled you were bound to fall, thatâs all
A boy kissed Bessie in the parlor one night
Why, oh, why did she yell with delight?
âCause Bessie couldnât help it any more
Than you could or I could

Aww, dum pe dum, now people listen
Bessie couldnât help it any more
Than you could or I could
No, Bessie couldnât help it though she tried to be good
Oh, so good

She was pretty as the heavens above
And oh, boy how that girl could love
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful
Bop, bop be de oww
Bessie couldnât help it any more
Than you could or I could

Now when she smiled you were bound to fall, thatâs all boy
Boy kissed Bessie in the street one night
My oh, my, how she yelled with delight
Bessie couldnât help it any more
Than you could or I could
