Lyrics:


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah

Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all

West Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground is, nah fuck all that
Came in the game on my neon fresh, won the first rap Grammy so I guess I'm blessed
Come off tours, walk on sets, everybody following the trends I set
60 million sold, doing it different, and my IG poppin' from doing it different
Bad vibrations, I stay distant, RatPack MSFTS doing it different
Fortnite doing the Carlton dance, come on, it's just different man

Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all

Used to be that motherfucker in the background, yeah, but now I'm in the forefront
'Cause I keep it more blunt, God damn
Pump up the jam, pump up the volume
I'm not Rakim, but I'm doper than
Pump up, pump up the jam, pump up the volume
I'm not Rakim, but I'm doper than Valium
Back in high-school I was not the man, now wherever I go they know who I am
From Maryland to Beijing I'm raging, paging the doctor on call, the illest of them all

Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all

This is for the people going hard in the gym
This is for the people going hard on the dance floor
Pump up the heart rate and dance more
Pump up the, pump up the motherfuckin' jam
Rhymin' like Dr. Seus, bitch I'm Sam I Am
I don't give a damn about lyrics, you should feel the spirit when you hear it
No fuckboys, a legend can't get near it
Sucka em-, sucka emcees they, sucka emcees, they fear it

Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
Don't be afraid to be different, don't be afraid to be different y'all
