Lyrics:


I can take 'em all
So I leave you with this thought
There is a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all

Do you hear me when I say
That I got to walk this way
There is a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all

And I will catch you when you fall
That is what I'm gonna do
And I will catch you if you call
That is what I'm gonna do

I can see for miles
And I can see you and your crimes
There is a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all

Do you hear me when I say
That I gotta walk this way
There is a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all

And I will catch you when you fall
That is what I'm gonna do
And I will catch you if you call
That is what I'm gonna do
