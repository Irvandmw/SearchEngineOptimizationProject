Lyrics:


Called her on the telephone
You picked up, I shoulda known
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night

You told me you had to go
You told me you'd be right home
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night

Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right

What do you take me for?
You didn't think I'd smell her on you as you walked through the door
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night

Last, this is the last time
You gotta get out, you aren't a man of mine
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night

Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right

Don't call me up, I won't be at home
Do not write, do not phone
I've had enough, you'll never know
You better pack your things and go
Don't tell me you're sorry
You shoulda thought of that
You shoulda that of me
We'll never be, never be
Listen here, you're dead to me, oh

Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right

Who do you think you are?
You got a lot of nerve, you pushed me too far
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night

Last chance, was just enough
She had a little metal thing, keep it zipped up
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night

Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
