Lyrics:


I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not that kind of guy
Beneath this sleek exterior
There's less than meets the eye

I'm just what you've been looking for
Your wildest dream come true
I'm not the man you think I am
But I'm the man for you

I'm on important business
I'm late for my premiere
I'm doing you a favor
Just by being here

Surely you can buy a drink
For someone so renowned
I'm not the man you think I am
But I'm the man you've found

I'm burning with indifference
I'm sleeping with desire
I'm selling snow to eskimos
I'm preaching to the choir

My past is catching up to me
My chips are coming due
I'm not the man you think I am
But I'm the man for you
