Gloria

My friends told me not to trust that Gloria
Sheâs got ill intentions right from the start
I said you donât understand my Gloria
Complicated yes, but pure at the heart
Today I  came home a little early
To find a stranger in my bed
And I said...

Gloria
Why do you play with me?
If  Iâm the only one
Then who the hell is he?
Did you have sex all day?
Just to tease me all night
Whoa oh-oh, Gloria
Can you just tell me why?

Why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?

I decided to forgive my Gloria
Said she would never do it again
So I went on a ten day cruise with Gloria
Hoping to get back to where we began
Then one night
I came back with some red wine
Just to find two sailers in my bed
And I said...

Gloria
Why do you play with me?
If I âm the only one
Then who the hell is he?
Did you have sex all day?
How could I be so blind?
Whoa oh-oh gloria
Can you just tell me why?

Why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?

Why, why, why, why?
Woo, woo, woo, woo
My friends told me not to trust that Gloria
Sheâs got ill intentions right from the start

Gloria
Why do you play with me?
(Said, why do you play with me?)
If I'm the only one
Then who the hell is he?
(Said, who the hell is he?)
Did you have sex all day?
(Can you just tell me?)
How could I be so blind?
(Can you just tell me?)
Whoa oh-oh gloria
Can you just tell me why?

Why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
Gloria, why?
