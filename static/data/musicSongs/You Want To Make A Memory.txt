Lyrics:


Hello again, itâs you and me
Kinda always like it used to be
Sippin' wine, killing time
Trying to solve lifeâs mysteries.
Howâs your life, itâs been a while
God itâs good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave.

If you donât know if you should stay
If you donât say whatâs on your mind
Baby just, breathe thereâs no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory.

I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
Itâs bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I donât wanna ask.

If you go now, Iâll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan
You wanna make a memory
You wanna steal a piece of time
You could sing a melody to me 
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory.

If you donât know if you should stay
And you donât say whatâs on your mind
Baby just, breathe thereâs no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory
You wanna steal a piece of time
You could sing a melody to me 
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory
You wanna make a memory
