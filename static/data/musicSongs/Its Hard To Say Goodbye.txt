Lyrics:


Thereâs something in your eyes
Thatâs far too revealing
Why must it be like this?
A love without feeling

Thereâs something wrong with you I know
I see it in your eyes
Believe me when I say
Itâs gonna be okay

I told you from the start
I wonât be demanding
(I wonât be demanding)
If you have a change of heart
Iâll be understanding
(Iâll be understanding)

When love becomes a broken heart
And dreams begin to die
Believe me when I say
Weâll work it out some way

Iâll never try to hold you back
I wouldnât try controlling you
If itâs what you want, itâs what I want
I want whatâs best for you

And if thereâs something else that youâre looking for
Iâll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
Itâs hard to say, goodbye

Weâve lost that loving touch
We use to feel so much
I try to hide, the truth thatâs in my eyes
(A love without feeling)

But when I feel, weâre not in love
I know Iâm losing you
Believe me when I say
Weâll work it out some way

Iâll never try to hold you back
I wouldnât try controlling you
If itâs what you want, itâs what I want
I want whatâs best for you

And if thereâs something else that youâre looking for
Iâll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
Itâs hard to say, goodbye

Donât say goodbye
If itâs what you want, itâs what I want
I want whatâs best for you

Iâll never try to hold you back
I wouldnât try controlling you
If itâs what you want, itâs what I want
I want whatâs best for you

And if thereâs something else that youâre looking for
Iâll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
Itâs hard to say goodbye

Iâll never try to hold you back
I wouldnât try controlling you
If itâs what you want, itâs what I want
I want whatâs best for you

And if thereâs something else that youâre looking for
Iâll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
Itâs hard to say goodbye
