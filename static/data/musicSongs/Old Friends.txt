Hey
Yeah
Yeah (Lookin' like a couple million)
Shittin' on my old friends

I'm out here shittin' on my old friends (Old friends)
Look how I'm livin' right now (Right now)
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now (Right now)
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now (Right now) right now
I'm out here shittin' on my old friends (Old friends)
Look how I'm livin' right now (Right now)
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now (Right now)
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now (Right now) right now

Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to your success
So every time I see a building, nigga I'ma flex
All of my life I knew I was the best
I put in some work and I ran up the check
I'm feelin' like I'm gonna need my respect
I'm gonna make all of y'all niggas regret
I just woke up in a house on the hills out in Cali
And I went and hopped on a jet
I just might fly to Miami today
Just to lay in the sun on a beach and get wet
I just went out on a date with my momma
And I told her I was gon' get her a mansion
And I can count all of my friends on my fingers
The only thing else that I need is my family
I can't let these niggas knock me out of my position
Actin' like they women, talkin' down to bitches
Fuckin' up my pimpin', don't got nothin' against 'em
Hope the Lord forgive 'em, I'm no longer with 'em
I'm too busy winnin', makin' good decisions
Playin' my position, kickin' back and chillin'
Toilet bowl, I'm sittin', metaphor, I'm shittin'
On all my old friends

I'm out here shittin' on my old friends (Old friends)
Look how I'm livin' right now (Right now)
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now (Right now)
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now (Right now) right now
I'm out here shittin' on my old friends (Old friends)
Look how I'm livin' right now (Right now)
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now (Right now)
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now (Right now) right now

Damn homie
In high school, you was the man, homie
But now you a regular nigga
The tables have turned and now everything different
We only had clothes when we stole 'em at Christmas
And I used to borrow the shoes from my brother
I'm honest enough with myself to admit it
Now I'm somewhere on a five-hour flight
Just to go live my life in a whole 'nother city
I can't have fun doin' none of this shit 'til the people
I love could afford to come with me
A whole lot of people was shittin' on me
And they think I forgot, but I never forget it
That's why I'm -shittin' on all my old friends

I'm out here shittin' on my old friends (Old friends)
Look how I'm livin' right now (Right now)
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now (Right now)
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now (Right now) right now
I'm out here shittin' on my old friends (Old friends)
Look how I'm livin' right now (Right now)
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now (Right now)
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now (Right now) right now

Hey
