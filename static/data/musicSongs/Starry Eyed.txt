Lyrics:


Oh, boy, you're starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Life doesn't always work out
Like you planned it
They say make lemonade out of lemons
But I try and I just can't understand it

All this trying for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn't matter now
The sun set on our love, bye, baby

Oh, boy, you're starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Life doesn't always work out
Like you planned it
They say make lemonade out of lemons
But I try and I can't understand it

All this begging for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn't matter now
The sun set on our love, bye, bye, baby

Oh, boy, you're starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

It doesn't matter what they say
Let's go do it anyway
'Cause you and I have an undying kind of love
You can be mine, I'll be yours, c'mon, baby

Oh, boy, you're starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Oh, boy, you're starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that
