Lyrics:


Oh God it hurt, the moment that I saw you
With someone else, the one that you belonged to
I never thought I'd drown in my shallow heart
I'd like to say the things I never used to
But come today they won't ever be useful
I never learnt to use my shallow heart

I I I, I never meant to hurt you
It's just something I do
I guess it's not a good excuse

And she will always hate me, no matter what I say
And there is no mistaking, the love is gone
Yeah she will always hate me, she said "you've lost me, baby"
No matter what I say, the love is gone.

Looking back I guess I'm holding on to
The good we had but I know that it's wrong too
'Cause in the end she's never gonna hold my heart
And now she knows, she doesn't wanna know me
I'm not supposed to be the one who's lonely
I never thought that she could have a cold cold heart

I I I, I never meant to hurt you
It's just something I do
I guess it's not a good excuse

And she will always hate me, no matter what I say
And there is no mistaking, the love is gone
Yeah she will always hate me, she said "you've lost me, baby"
No matter what I say, the love is gone

I I I, I never meant to hurt you
It's just something I do
I guess it's not a good excuse

And she will always hate me, no matter what I say
And there is no mistaking, the love is gone
Yeah she will always hate me, she said "you've lost me, baby"
No matter what I say, the love is gone
