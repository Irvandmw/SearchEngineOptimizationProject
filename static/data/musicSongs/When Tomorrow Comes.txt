Lyrics:


I - I'm lying oh so quiet by your side
afraid that you will open up your eyes
cause when the morning comes you'll say goodbye

And now I see a ray of sunlight on your bed
I try to move the curtain once again
it doesn't really matter anyway
I know it it's all over

[Chorus:]
cause when tomorrow comes
you'll be gone
slow down sunrise
I'm holding on to you
all night through
until tomorrow comes

hush don't let nobody wake my baby
hush oh let this moment stay forever
just for us

No - a cabbage can has fallen in the street
you're crying and you're talking in your sleep
I take your hand and listen to you breathe

So it won't be long before the night is through
then emptiness and loneliness will rule
and memories are all that's left of you
I know it - it's all over

[Chorus:]
cause when tomorrow comes
you'll be gone
slow down sunrise
I'm holding on to you
all night through
until tomorrow comes

hush don't let nobody wake my baby
hush oh let this moment stay forever
just for us

Hush hush
hush hush
I whisper in your ear
Hush hush
hush hush
just go back to sleep baby

cause when tomorrow comes
you'll be gone
slow down sunrise
I'm holding on to you
all night through
until tomorrow comes

hush don't let nobody wake my baby
hush oh let this moment stay forever
hush forever cannot ever be enough for us
