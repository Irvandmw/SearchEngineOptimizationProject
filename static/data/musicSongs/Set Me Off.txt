Lyrics:


You can terrorize, tell your lies
Cut me down to half the size
Sell the hate, walk away
Try and self-exonerate
I can take a fall
And get back up, it gets me off
Because I live to fight
Try and stop me before I get by

You set me off with every word you say
Talking down on me
Why donât you sing a prayer
You set me off with all the lies you told
Your shit is getting old
Why donât you sing a prayer
You set me off
You set me off

Iâm against the wall, against the rest
I give it all, you got nothing left 
You never stop, you never learn
You want to watch me crash and burn
But I wonât take the fall
Crash and burn and lose it all
Iâll rise above, rise against
Iâll slay it all, it's self-defense

You set me off with every word you say
Talking down on me
Why donât you sing a prayer
You set me off with all the lies you told
Your shit is getting old
Why donât you sing a prayer
You set me off

Iâm not gonna run
Iâm not gonna crawl
Iâm not gonna lose myself
Iâm not gonna fade
Iâm not gonna fall
Youâre not gonna break my world

You set me off with every word you say
Talking down on me
Why donât you sing a prayer
You set me off with all the lies you told
Your shit is getting old
Why donât you sing a prayer

You set me off with every word you say
Talking down on me
Why donât you sing a prayer
You set me off with all the lies you told
Your shit is getting old
Why donât you sing a prayer

You set me off
You set me off
You set me off
You set me off
