Lyrics:


Baby, I know that you've been waiting patiently
For a man to give you all that you need
And love you like he should
Sticking to your guns, looking for the right one
Just somebody who treats you good
It took me a while but I got here as fast as I could

I ran full speed ahead
Without stopping to rest
Not knowing where I was headed too
Now that I'm here
It's perfectly clear
That I was making my way to you
Can't believe how long it took
But I got here as fast as I could

I've ended up on at least 200 dead end roads
Where my heart and I just wound up broke
Lost and misunderstood
I tried to rush finding true love
It didn't pan out how I thought it would
It took me some time,
But I got here as fast as I could

I ran full speed ahead
Without stopping to rest
Not knowing where I was headed too
Now that I'm here
It's perfectly clear
That I was making my way to you
Can't believe how long it took
But I got here as fast as I could

I ran full speed ahead
Without stopping to rest
Not knowing where I was headed too
Now that I'm here
It's perfectly clear
That I was making my way to you
Can't believe how long it took
But I got here as fast as I could

Yeah I got here as fast as I could
