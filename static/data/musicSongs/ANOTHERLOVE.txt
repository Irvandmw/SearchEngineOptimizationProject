Lyrics:


You said I was what you wanted
Liar, liar
You never wanted me that way

I was just something U flaunted
Hired and fired
U never had a plan 2 stay

If you don't like it, round here
Find another love, another love
Anyone can see it so clear
I'll find another, another, another, another love
If U don't like this baby
Find another, another love
U don't have a right 2 fake it
Find another, another love

I tried to be what you wanted
But I'm tired, I'm tired
I don't really need you, anyway... No

The house we used to share it's now
Haunted, expired
A couple 100 days we'd have to pray. Amen

If you don't like it, round here
Find another love, another love
Anyone can see it so clear
I'll find another, another, another, another love
If U don't like this baby
Find another, another love
U don't have a right 2 fake it
Find another, another love

Move on, move on
Move on, move on
Find another love, find another love
I've got to find another love
(Another another love)

I used to think I was so much fun
Now I'm just the guilty one
Everything we used 2 share
Our clothes and even our hair
Now all U see is what I did
But how come I can't tell me that kid
Behind my back I'm just a so and so
But I'm the greatest living soul
U'll ever know

(Another another love)
(Another another love)
(Another another love)
(Another another love)
(Another another love)
(Another another love)
