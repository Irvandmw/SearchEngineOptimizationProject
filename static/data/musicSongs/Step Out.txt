Lyrics:


What she said
She said to me
Take me high on a mountain side
She was dressed up in leopard skin
And her soul would never be denied 

I met her down the disco in a beat up car
She was burning down the road
She looked just like a star with a Jaguar
She needs to lighten her load 

And when you might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight 

You might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight 

What I said I said to her
I'm alive when you walk that way
Can you hear what I can hear?
It's the sound of a brand new day 

She met me down a disco in a beat up car
I was burning down the road
I can be a star in a Jaguar
I need to lighten my load 

Because you might think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight 

You might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight 

My whole life still sinking in the water
I need a ship not your sweet lip tonight 

You might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight 

You might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight
