Lyrics:


All I've got's love for love city
All of her people are my people too
Every color, every creed
Together in good times, together in need
All I've got's love for love city

No I wasn't there on the island
The night that the drums went silent
But as much as I've lived my life on her shoulder
I'll be apart of the encore yeah
'Cause all I've got's love for love city

All of her people are my people too
Every color, every creed
Together in good times, together in need
All I've got's love for love city

[Kenny Chesney & Ziggy Marley:]
My healin' my heaven my home
The day that I found you
My burdens were gone
The same as you give
Your gift of freedom
This gift gives back
Now now that you need 'em, yeah

'Cause all we feel's love for the city
Yeah, all of her people are my people too
Every color, every creed
Together in good time, together in need
All I've got's love for love city, yeah

Come share the love come feel the love
All I've got's love love for city
Come share the love come feel the love
All I've got's love love for city
For love city
Yeah
All of her people are my people too
True that
For love city
