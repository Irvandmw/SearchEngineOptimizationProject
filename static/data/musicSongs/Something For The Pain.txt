Lyrics:


That's it come in
Why?
You can't swim

Happiness, it's been no friend to me
But "Forever After" ain't what it's all cracked up to be
Yeah, I had a taste, you were my fantasy
But I almost lost my faith when I hit reality

I don't need no guru to tell me what to do
When you're feeling like a headline on yesterday's news

Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when I feel I'm danglin' on a hangman's noose

Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel alright
Something like you

Come on, come on, come on

Loneliness has found a home in me
My suitcase and guitar are my only family
I've tried to need someone like they needed me
But I opened up my heart, but all I did was bleed

I don't need no lover just to get it screwed
They don't make no band-aid that's gonna cover my bruise

Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when I feel I'm danglin' on a hangman's noose

Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel alright
Something like you

Come on, come on, come on

(Help I'm falling)
Pull me under through my veins
To a place where I feel no pain
(Night is calling)
Be the pillow under my head
Cover me when I'm in your bed

(Feels like I'm flying)
Take me higher than I've ever been
Take me down and back again
(Christ I'm dying)
Come to me, be my disguise
Open your coat, let me crawl inside

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when I feel I'm danglin' on a hangman's noose

Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel alright
Something like you

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when I feel I'm danglin' on a hangman's noose

Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel alright
Something like you

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Give me
Give me something for the pain
Give me
Give me something for the blues
Give me
Gotta to give me something for the pain baby
Give me
