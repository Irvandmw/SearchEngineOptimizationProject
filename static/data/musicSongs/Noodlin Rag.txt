Lyrics:


A doodle de doo, a doodle de doo 
a doo doo doodle dee-ody (Doodle de doo, doodle de doo) 
A doodle doo, doodle de doo 
I love to hear a band that's playin' a doodle de doo  
A doodlin' to the noodlin' rag (Oh, the noodlin' rag!) 
I love to keep my honey swayin' a doodle de doo  
A doodlin' to the noodlin' rag (Yes, the noodlin' rag!) 

Hear that happy rhythm  
Makes me happy with 'em 
All night I shout to the leader 
"Mister, won't you play it again?" 
I want to hear the clarinet go a doodle de doo  
A doodlin' to the noodlin' rag (Play the noodlin' rag!) 
An' when the trombone and the trumpet  
start to noodle along  
Yes Sir! It's my favorite song!  
'Cause it makes my baby wanna cuddle up closer  
'Cause it never lets my feet drag  
I love to hear a band that's playin' a doodle de doo  
A doodlin' to the tune called the noodlin' rag! (We love a noodlin' song!) 

I love to noodle along!  
A doodle de doo, a doodle de doo 

Yes, hear that happy rhythm (Ha ha ha hah!) 
Makes me happy with 'em (Ha ha ha hah!) 
All night I shout to the leader 
"Mister, won't you play it again?" 
(We want to hear the clarinet go...) a doodle de doo  
A doodlin' to the noodlin' rag  
(An' when the trombone and the trumpet start to noodle along...) 
Yes Sir! It's my favorite song!  
'Cause it makes my baby wanna cuddle up closer  
'Cause it never lets my feet drag  
We love to hear a band that's playin' a doodle de doo (A doodle de doo) 
A doodle de doo (Doodle de doo) 
The tune called the good old noodlin' rag!
