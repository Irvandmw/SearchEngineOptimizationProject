Lyrics:


(Yeah yo last girl was cool
But she ain't doing it like a stallion
Doing it like a stallion
Them other girls look good
But can they work it like a stallion)

Bitch it's money making Megan
Better known as The Stallion
Hanging round your daddy neck
Just like a damn medallion
Body so on point so I dress like I'm swimming
Bitches get offended, can't handle all this pimpin
Young Tina Snow, hard on a hoe
We can get down with this money
Or get down on the floor
He thought I was singer, I told him I was a swagga
I ain't no RnB bitch nigga
Come and lick the rapper

Baby
I love the way you ride and push back on it
It let's me know you want it
Girl let's get into it
I'm horny so let's do it
Baby you a stallion
Love the way you move it
Yeah yo last girl was cool
But she ain't doing it like a stallion
She ain't doing it like a stallion
Them other girls look good
But can they work it like a stallion
Can they, can they work it like a stallion
Work it like a stallion
Work it like a stallion
Shawty may look good but
It don't mean shit if she can't
Work it like a stallion
Work it like a stallion
I love it when she work it like a stallion

In heels workin' the wheel
Whippin' the foreign like a cutlass
Real big titties, big butt bitch
Young and seductive
Picture me drippin' in sweat
My body so hot and so wet
You runnin' yo hands thru my hair
I'm pokin' it out in the air ay
I got all these niggas asking
Who the fuck The Stallion is
Seen my instagram pics
Now he tryna give me the dick uh
Sexy red lips, sexy outfit
I'm giving it to him so hard
I'm giving it to him so good he lovin' this shit

Baby
I love the way you ride and push back on it
It let's me know you want it
Girl let's get into it
I'm horny so let's do it
Baby you a stallion
Love the way you move it
Yeah yo last girl was cool
But she ain't doing it like a stallion
She ain't doing it like a stallion
Them other girls look good
But can they work it like a stallion
Can they, can they work it like a stallion
Work it like a stallion
Work it like a stallion
Shawty may look good but
It don't mean shit if she can't
Work it like a stallion
Work it like a stallion
I love it when she work it like a stallion

He say he ain't hittin' my line no mo
Cause I'on never text back
I told that nigga shut up
Cause it's a hunnit times he done said that
Nigga acting like he gone but I bet you he back
Who else be workin' it, workin' it, workin' it
Workin' it throwin' it back like that

Baby
I love the way you ride and push back on it
It let's me know you want it
Girl let's get into it
I'm horny so let's do it
Baby you a stallion
Love the way you move it
Yeah yo last girl was cool
But she ain't doing it like a stallion
She ain't doing it like a stallion
Them other girls look good
But can they work it like a stallion
Can they, can they work it like a stallion
Work it like a stallion
Work it like a stallion
Shawty may look good but
It don't mean shit if she can't
Work it like a stallion
Work it like a stallion
I love it when she work it like a stallion
