Lyrics:


When the sun goes down
Record reblown, the horizon comes to life
Blue electric eye
The feeling that haunts me keeps me up at night

Do you know where do we go
When we're both stuck in the cold?
City lights, they wait in the dark

So if the feeling's nice, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise

When the rain falls down
Watch me clean, baptized up in your love, ay
Many dreams are found
Pulling me deeper, deeper to the light so

Do you know where do we go
When we're both stuck in the cold?
City lights, they wait in the dark

So if the feeling's nice, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise

This is nostalgic
This is our journey so don't stop believing
And you know that I got this
Constantly playing, oh let me going back in time

So if the feeling's nice, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise
So if the feeling's nice, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise

Back to the 80s, when music was your life
We can have the greatest time
Back to the 80s, the perfect time
We're back in time
