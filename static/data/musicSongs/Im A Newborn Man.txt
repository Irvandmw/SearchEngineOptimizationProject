Lyrics:


[Johnny Cash:] Iâm a newborn man
[Carter Sisters:] Iâm a newborn man
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
[Johnny:] Iâm a newborn man and on a rock I stand
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
[Johnny:] Iâm a newborn man
[Carter Sisters:] Iâm a newborn man
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
[Johnny:] Iâm a newborn man and on a rock I stand
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
[Johnny:] He put a light on me
[Carter Sisters:] He put a light on me
[All:] He put a light on me
[Johnny:] He put a light on me so now I can see
[All:] He put a light on me
[Johnny:] He loves me all the time
[Carter Sisters:] He loves me all the time
[All:] He loves me all the time
[Johnny:] He loves me all of the time, Iâm His and Heâs mine
[All:] He loves me all the time
[Johnny:] Iâm a newborn man
[Carter Sisters:] Iâm a newborn man
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
[Johnny:] Iâm a newborn man and on the rock I stand
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
[Johnny:]
I was dying and the time was flying
And I heard Him calling me
My will was bent and I did repent
And His sweet love set me free
[Johnny:] Iâm a newborn man
[Carter Sisters:] Iâm a newborn man
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
[Johnny:] Iâm a newborn man and on a rock I stand
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
[Johnny:] Iâm a newborn man
[Carter Sisters:] Iâm a newborn man
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
[Johnny:] Iâm a newborn man and on the rock I stand
[All:] Iâm a newborn man
