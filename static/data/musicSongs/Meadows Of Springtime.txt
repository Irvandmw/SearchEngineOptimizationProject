Lyrics:


Among the things that I love the most
Other than you, baby, there is obviously
Summer, winter, ooh, spring and fall
And those soft summer rain and thinking of you darling
And those first blossoms of springtime, picking early
And blossom in white like our love, you and me, baby, me and you

You and me in meadows of springtime
You and me laying in red
You and me in meadows of springtime
Making love at last, darling I love you, oh, how I love you

You and me, yeah, in meadows of springtime
You and me laying in red
You and me in meadows of springtime
Together in one

You know just how much I love you, yeah
And the things that you do ain't so wrong
Hey, you know it, you know it, you know it, you know it darling
You lend a way from, from the best part
Say you love me, say you need me, and then feel it, feel it in your heart

Oh, oh, you and me, you and me, you and me in meadows of springtime
Hey, just laying in the sun
You and me in meadows of springtime
Together in one, darling I love you, and oh, you know I love you

You and me, baby, in meadows, oh, meadows of springtime, eh eh
You and me laying in the sun, ooh
Together in one, eh, eh, eh

I love you, oh, I love you, yeah, I love you, I love you
In meadows, with the rose and daisies and sweet mess I'm in, eh, eh, yeah
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby
In meadows of springtime
