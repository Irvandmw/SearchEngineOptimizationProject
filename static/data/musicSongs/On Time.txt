Lyrics:


I ain't got time, I only got a dime to make a last call
I'm gettin' soaking wet and it ain't rained yet since last fall
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern Railroad Line
I don't have to worry 'cause I know it never leaves on time

Late last night we made love and everythin' was all right
You walked out the door and the only thing I saw was the hall light
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern Railroad Line
I don't have to worry 'cause I know it never leaves on time

Why didn't you see that you don't feel the same way that I do
I understood before that you couldn't take much more as I knew
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern Railroad Line
I don't have to worry 'cause I know it never leaves on time.
