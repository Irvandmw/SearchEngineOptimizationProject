Lyrics:


Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
I would've kissed you, baby
Standing 'neath the mistletoe

Santa came down the chimney
About a half past three
Let all these pretty presents
That you see before me
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure been good to me
I haven't had a toddy this morning
But I'm lit up like a Christmas tree

Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
...

Give love on Christmas Day
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift than love...

Merry Christmas, baby!
