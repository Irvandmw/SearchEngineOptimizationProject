Lyrics:


I always knew
That you'd come back to get me
And you always knew
That it wouldn't be easy
To go back to the start
To see where it all began
Or end up at the bottom
To watch how it all ends

You tried to lie and say 
I was everything
I remember when I said
I'm nothing without you
I'm nothing without you

Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
Let me inside
Let me get close to you
Change your mind
I'll get lost
If you want me to
Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you

You always thought
That I left myself open
But you didn't know
I was already broken
I told myself
That it wouldn't be so bad
But pulling away
You took everything I had

You tried to lie and 
Say I was everything
I remember when I said 
I'm nothing without you 
I'm nothing without you

Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
Let me inside
Let me get close to you
Change your mind
I'll get lost
If you want me to
Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
In you

The pain of it all
The rise and the fall
I see it all
In you
Now everyday
I find myself say
I want to get lost in you
I'm nothing without you

Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
Let me inside
Let me get close to you
Change your mind
I'll get lost
If you want me to but
Somehow I found 
Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you 
A way to get lost in you 
A way to get lost in you
