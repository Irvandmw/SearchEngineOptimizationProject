Lyrics:


She won't look me in the eye
We stopped talking 'bout tomorrow
Even the silence is deafening
As she uneasily checks her phone

I know something's not right
Something, someone she's hiding
The tear in her eye, it says it all
It's not her fault, I can tell that she's sorry

Oh, but she wants what she wants
Oh, and she needs what she needs
Oh, and she loves who she loves
And it ain't me

I'm putting pieces together
Sitting here in this empty room
I think I know why she had to leave
It's one of those things that really wasn't meant to be

Oh, but she wants what she wants
Oh, and she needs what she needs
Oh, and she loves who she loves
And it ain't me, no, it ain't me

Oh, I've been through the pain and disbelief
Now I'm left with the sense of sad relief

Oh 'cause she wants what she wants
She needs what she needs
Oh, and she loves who she loves
It ain't me

She wants what she wants
Oh, and she needs what she needs
She loves who she loves
And it ain't me, no, it ain't me
