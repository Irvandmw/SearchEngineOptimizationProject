Lyrics:


[Verse 1:]
So many people spend most of their lives just draggin their feet
Afraid to take a chance, worried about nothing much, getting their means
I know I'm bound to make mistakes and I'm gunna fall
But I will be the kind of man to hold up my head, to get back up, to dust myself back off

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna burn up that highway
Chase my dreams and tempt fate
Do things they say just cant be done
I'm gunna take in every sunset
Breath each breath like it could be my last
Just in case tomorrow never comes
I'm gunna live, laugh and love
Yeah baby

[Verse 2:]
I wanna get high but placed in each kiss I'm feelin that touch
Never had a reason to ever say I didn't give enough
I would climb the highest mountain and count every star
As long as my hearts beating I'll live on the edge
Laugh till it hurts
Live, love make my mark

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna burn up that highway
Chase my dreams and tempt fate
Do things they say just cant be done
I'm gunna take in every sunset
Breath each breath like it could be my last
Just in case tomorrow never comes
I'm gunna live, laugh and love

[Bridge:]
Lifes as good as it gets (yeah)
When theres no regrets (regrets)
Oh no regrets

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna burn up that highway
Chase my dreams and tempt fate
Do things they say just cant be done
I'm gunna take in every sunset
Breath each breath like it could be my last
Just in case tomorrow never comes
I'm gunna live, laugh and love
I'm gunna live, laugh and love

Ooh, yeah

Come on
