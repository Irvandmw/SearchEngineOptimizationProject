Lyrics:


Sleepy time gal, 
You're turnin' night into day! 
Sleepy time gal, 
You've danced the ev'ning away! 

Before each silvery star fades out of sight, 
Please give me one little kiss, then let us whisper "Goodnight," 
It's gettin' late and, Dear, your pillow's waitin'... 
Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through, 
Sleepy time gal, I'll find a cottage for you. 

You'll learn to cook and to sew, 

What's more, you'll love it, I know! 
When you're a stay-at-home, play-at-home, 
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal! 

[instrumental repeat of verse]

You'll learn to cook and to sew, 
What's more, you'll love it, I know! 
When you're a stay-at-home, play-at-home, 
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal!
