Lyrics:


[Chris Brown:]
In my head for life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh
For life
I'll take it, take it
For you, for you

[Tory Lanez:]
You know I speak more live when I'm gettin' high
See more me than a nigga see
Sippin' on PatrÃ³n, Hennessy
I been on the dope, no lie 'cause I don't lie
Wonderin' if we finna go live
Jump in the pussy and change your whole life
When I get in the nookie, I spend the whole night
I been on the tea so long
Shawty, you don't need to tease at all
Quit sellin' the pussy, don't want the fees at all
Just relax your mind and let me ease it off, ease it off
'Cause we done did some things to make it cold in the summer
When I swim in your water, it's like you're holdin' me under, oh

[Chris Brown:]
No, I'm not tryna chase you 'round
Around this bed
You can keep on running, baby, don't stop
Lick it up, kiss it, baby, don't stop
Hell yeah
I got my weight up (Weight up)
All this energy, baby
All this chemistry between me and you
Ooh, ooh, baby
This shit is ridiculous
Girl, come get this dick you love
And just tell me how you feel
How you feel?
This shit is ridiculous
Settle down, you know I'm down for you
Anything you need
Girl, come get this dick you love
Just tell me how you feel

Baby girl, don't run from me
I'ma lick it 'til you tired
I'ma beat it up, beat it up
Throw your body
And it's okay, I'ma make you mine
Is it that you're makin' foreplay?
Don't need no cosign
Say you're ready, love me, baby, more
I don't wanna be the fool
I just wanna be the answer
Let me put my lips on you
Be my private dancer tonight
I'ma make it rain
No chance tonight
No, I'm not...

No, I'm not tryna chase you 'round
Around this bed
You can keep on running, baby, don't stop
Lick it up, kiss it, baby, don't stop
Hell yeah
I got my weight up (Weight up)
All this energy, baby
All this chemistry between me and you
Ooh, ooh, baby
This shit is ridiculous
Girl, come get this dick you love
And just tell me how you feel
How you feel?
This shit is ridiculous
Settle down, you know I'm down for you
Anything you need
Girl, come get this dick you love
Just tell me how you feel
