Lyrics:
Lyrics:


(Three wishes just three simple wishes)
If I only had three wishes
Here is just what I would do
First I'd wish for days of gladness
With a someone sweet and true

For my second wish a dream house
Cozy fireside for two
And the last of my three wishes
Please love me as I love you

(If I only had three wishes)
(Here is just what I would do)
(First I'd wish for days of gladness)
(With a someone sweet and true)

For my second wish a dream house
Cozy fireside for two
And the last of my three wishes
Please love me as I love you
Please love me as I love you
