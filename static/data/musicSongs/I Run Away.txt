Lyrics:


You took your love away, too fast
Left no chance to say look back
And now I know the truth,
It makes it easier
Maybe when time goes by,
Iâll understand

Letâs pretend, that Iâve moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.
Open my eyes, Look deep inside.
I run away [x3]

You threw it all away
So blind
You pushed me far from you,
In your life.
Now I know the tears,
Wonât lead to loneliness
Maybe when time goes by,
Iâll understand

Letâs pretend, that Iâve moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.
Open my eyes, Look deep inside.
I run away [x4]

Letâs pretend, that Iâve moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.
Open my eyes, Look deep inside.
I run away [x3]

Letâs pretend, that Iâve moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.
Open my eyes, Look deep inside.
I run away [x3]

Let's pretend, that I've moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.
