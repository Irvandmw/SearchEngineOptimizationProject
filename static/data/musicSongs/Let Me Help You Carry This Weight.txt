Lyrics:


[John Carter Cash:]
Through the lonely streets and up the hill
Past the rabid dogs whose bite would kill
To the lonely rock where time stands still
Let me help you carry the weight

[Johnny Cash:]
On the road of tears where sorrow waits
Every step you take makes my heart break
Seems to me youâre moving toward hellâs gate
Let me help you carry the weight

[Johnny and June Carter:]
Let me help you carry the weight
Let me help you carry the weight
Itâs getting dark and the hour is late
Lord, let me help you carry the weight

[June:] The sky turned black and the lightning came down
Teardrops from heaven shook the ground
[June and John Carter:] Looking at his mother I thought I heard him say
[June and Johnny Cash:] Let me help you carry the weight

[Johnny and June:]
Let me help you carry the weight
Let me help you carry the weight
Itâs getting dark and the hour is late
Lord, let me help you carry the weight

Let me help you carry the weight
Let me help you carry the weight
Itâs getting dark and the hour is late
Lord, let me help you carry the weight

Itâs getting dark and the hour is late
Lord, let me help you carry the weight
