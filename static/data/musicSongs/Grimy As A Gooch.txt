Lyrics:


[Verse 1:]
Iont fuck around
I been getting down
Not afraid to eat some triscuits up off the ground

5 second rule?
I'm on that 5 year
A lotta guys fear what I got in my ears (wax)

If I ain't pissin then you know I'm shittin bricks
Do it sick, when I finish homie I ain't washin shit
Shaved dick, shave with, same shit, face get
Bitches sittin on ma pillows and they butt naked

Lickin grease off of that pizza
And these mafuckas prolly want a paper towel
Errybody know that I rape toenails
When I pick, then I flick em on the straight up ground now

Ain't shit to a mafuckan balla
Mo grit than a mafuckan dolla
Come back from ballin, you gotta smell sack
Yea it's that appalling

And Ion't ever wash ma feet
When I'm in the shower, they be hard to reach
When I'm getting down, goin out on the weekend
I'm asleep before I brush my teeth

I'm a goddamn G tho
Mo grime than Ed Reed's pee hole
Mo grime than Ronaldhino
These other rappers can't deny it

[Chorus:]
Cause I don't even act like a thug
But I'm cold enough

I ain't moving crack, holdin guns
But there's more than one dimension to a balla

You can find ya boy around the way
Being scummy and fucking grubby you know I'm tryna say

That I'm grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch (swag)
Grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch (swag)

It take a slimy muthafucka to be grimy as a grundle
So you in trouble, if you attempt to try to be as gutter as the kid

[Verse 2:]
Eating wings
Beating off
Dick stings from the muthufuckan hot sauce (swagga)

Came nuts... no tp
Lazy so I rub it on the damn sheets
Ya man D on that reggie evans shit
Boogie pickin, boogie flickin, hella belly button lint

Fuck a bitch, and I'm wetter than a muthafuckin swish
Yeah I'm sweating more than CC bases loaded, bottom 6

I'm eating mixed nuts with my mouth wide open
At bar a bar where them house flies float
Iont give a fuck if it flush if I must urinate
Not a place up in the house I wouldn't go

I sink piss, and I sniff clothes
Nastier than Kimbo
And I lick snow
When it's yellow
And I sleep at the hotel on

That old blanket that yo mamma used to never let you touch
I just don't give a fuck, I'm nasty like the nut of johnny kruk
I do the dutch oven to maself
Fuckin with the way it smells
So if someone sicker well then tell me

[Chorus:]
Cause I don't even act like a thug
But I'm cold enough

I ain't moving crack, holdin guns
But there's more than one dimension to a balla

You can find ya boy around the way
Being scummy and fucking grubby you know I'm tryna say

That I'm grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch (swag)
Grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch (swag)

It take a slimy muthafucka to be grimy as a grundle
So you in trouble, if you attempt to try to be as gutter as the kid
