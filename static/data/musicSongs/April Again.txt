Lyrics:


(Oh, If I could live April again, If only I could live April again,) 
How happy I would be again. 
Oh, If I could live April again, 
If only I could live April again, 
How happy I would be again. 
The early morning rain 
Falling on my window makes me think of you again. 
I pretend that you're here with me 
And tho' it seems like April again. 
(It's not the same.) 
It's not the same. 
Oh, if I could live April again, 
If only I could live April again, 
How happy I would be again. 
Flowers that we saved 
Pressed between the pages of the book have turned to gray. 
But still I close my eyes and hold them 
And know that it's not April again. 
(It seems that way.) 
It seems that way. 
Oh, if I could live April again, 
If only I could live April again, 
How happy I would be again. 
Oh, if I could live April again, 
If only I could live April again.
