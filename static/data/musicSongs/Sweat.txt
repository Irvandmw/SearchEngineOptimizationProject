Lyrics:


There you go, there you go girl
Don't you start with me
Cause I don't really wanna hear it now
Let it go, let it go girl
What we keep fighting about baby
It's feeling like a merry go round

I don't really wanna
I don't really wanna think or talk about it
Cause all we seem to do is
All we seem to do is scream and shout about it
Cause there you go, there you go boy
You just keep breaking me down
Spinning my head around

[Chorus:]
So if you really wanna fight
We can take it to the bed tonight
(Let's sweat it out)
And if you really wanna scream
I can make you scream tonight
(Let's sweat it out)
Through the good (through the good)
Through the bad (through the bad)
Be the best fight you'll ever had
Make you say ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Forget that you were ever mad

There you go, there you go girl
You don't get smart with me
Cause I can tell you really want it now, hey babe
Take it slow, take it slow girl
You just get breaking me down baby
Working me inside and out

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't really wanna
I don't really wanna think or talk about it
Cause all we seem to do is
All we seem do is scream and shout about it
Cause there you go, there you go boy
You just keep breaking me down
Spinning my head around

[Chorus:]
So if you really wanna fight
We can take it to the bed tonight
(Let's sweat it out)
And if you really wanna scream
I can make you scream tonight
(Let's sweat it out)
Through the good (through the good)
Through the bad (through the bad)
Be the best fight you'll ever had
Make you say ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Forget that you were ever mad

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't really wanna
I don't really wanna think or talk about it
Cause all we seem to do is
All we seem do is scream and shout about it
Cause there you go, there you go boy
You just keep breaking me down
Spinning my head around

[Chorus x2:]
So if you really wanna fight
We can take it to the bed tonight
(We can take it to the bed tonight)
And if you really wanna scream
I can make you scream tonight
(I can make you scream, baby)
Through the good (through the good)
Through the bad (through the bad)
Be the best fight you'll ever had
Make you say ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Forget that you were ever mad

So if you really wanna fight
We can take it to the bed tonight
(Take it to the bed, take it to the bed)
And if you really wanna scream
I can make you scream tonight
Through the good, through the bad
Be the best fight you'll ever had
Make you say ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Forget that you were ever mad
