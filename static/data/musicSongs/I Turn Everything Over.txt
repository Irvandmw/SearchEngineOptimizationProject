Lyrics:


Monday found me on my knees again
Breathing you in
To blur the lines that mark where I begin
And where you end
No use in trying to pretend
Come take me again
'Cause rumor has it I'm not who I've been
Come define me

What can we do
If the rumors are true?

I turn everything over
Turn myself in
I turn everything over
Turn myself in
There's nothing left of me to defend
I turn everything over
Turn myself in

The evidence convicts the hollow man
After looking inside
To my dismay I find I'm just one of them
'Cause I'm an already but not yet resurrected fallen man
Come break this limbo
And I know you know just who I've been
Come define me

What can we do
If the rumors are true?

I turn everything over
Turn myself in
I turn everything over
Turn myself in
There's nothing left of me to defend
I turn everything over
Turn myself in

Rumor has it you love me
Rumor has it the world spins upside down
Rumor has it my only hope is you
And the rumors are true

I turn everything over

What can we do
If the rumors are true?

I turn everything over
Turn myself in
I turn everything over
Turn myself in
There's nothing left of me to defend
I turn everything over
Turn myself in

I turn everything over
Turn myself in
I turn everything over
Turn myself in
There's nothing left of me to defend
I turn everything over
Turn myself in
