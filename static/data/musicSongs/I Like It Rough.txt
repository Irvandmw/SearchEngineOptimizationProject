Lyrics:


(Initiate
Cherry cherry boom boom
Lady Gaga
I like it rough)

Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life
With love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Loving me is like chewing on pearls

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

Won't go without my fix tonight
It's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines
And she can't get enough

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life
With love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Loving me is like straightening curls

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough

Is it 'cause you don't mean it
Or because I don't feel it
Unless it's rough

Is it because you don't mean it
Or because I don't feel it
Yes it's rough

(Lady Gaga)

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough

You've got me wondering why I
I like it rough I
I like it rough I
I like it rough
