Lyrics:


(Bom bom bitchdom, bom, bom)
I see y'all in the front row
Hey
(Bom bom bitchdom, bom)

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down

Baby, such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, five star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, make that wood
Holly like the boulevard
