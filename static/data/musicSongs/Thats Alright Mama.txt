Lyrics:


Well that's alright mama
That's alright with you
Any way you do, well that's alright
That's alright
That's alright now mama, any way you do

Well mama she done told me
Papa done told me too
Son, that girl you're foolin' with
She ain't no good for you

Well that's alright
That's alright
That's alright now mama, any way you do

I'm leavin' town my baby
Leavin' town for sure
Then you won't be bothered with me
Hangin' 'round your door
Well that's alright
That's alright
That's alright now mama, any way you do
Well that's alright now mama, any way you do
