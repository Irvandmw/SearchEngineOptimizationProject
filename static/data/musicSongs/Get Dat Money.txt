Lyrics:


[Chris Brown:]
Look how she up and down that pole, just clap that ass up on that pole
Twerk, twerk, twerk, aw yeah
Now pop that pussy for a real nigga, now do it, get that money baby
Now pop that pussy for a real nigga, go ahead and get that money baby

[Chorus - Chris Brown:]
Look how she up and down that pole
Stripper bitches, got a couple singles for you
Just clap that ass up on that pole
Twerk, twerk, twerk
Aw yeah, now pop that pussy for a real nigga
Now do it, get that money baby
Now pop that pussy for a real nigga
Go ahead and get that money baby

[Lil Durk:]
Hundred dollar bottle, what the strippers swallow?
Malaya Blacc Chyna, shout out to Tyga
Red Bottoms just to match the 'Rari Spider
Plain Jane Rolly got them bitches on fire
Now whoever say I cuff hoes
I just break the band on the bitch that's on that pole
Pussy popping, got the squad turning up with hoes
Ace of Spades, VIP, we see TV like show
Now oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Got spice red all on my shoe
We global like we on the news
Stay in the best designer, we be on the news, let's get it

[Chorus]

[French Montana:]
Came flipping, I bought it, when I came through in that foreign
Only fuck with them bad bitches, them square bitches be boring
She need five stacks on that hair, coke, pills I'm on
Been getting money all year, all them cribs I own
Shawty help me slanging fish to meet me at the yard
God damn, young nigga made it hot
Shawty bent it over, told me land on it
Came with a 100 large, Uncle Sam on 'em
She spinning on the top like a ceiling fan
I can catch a rico off the Instagram
Wrist wrapped up, John Wall
Stacking money up, wall to wall

[Chorus]
