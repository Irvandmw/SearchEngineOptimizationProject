Lyrics:


Bye, bye, my friend, I'm leaving
I'm gonna feast on the stars in the sky
And while I be gone, don't stop dreaming
And don't be sad and don't cry

'Cause lazy days and sunny rays will guide me
Back home to where I belong
If God gives me grace, then He will find me a space
And I hope I'll be singing this song

Don't stop being happy
Don't stop your clapping
Don't stop your laughing
Take a piece of life, it's alright
To hold back the night

Lazy days and sunny rays will guide me
Back home to where I belong
If God gives me grace, then He will find me a space
And I hope I'll be singing this song

Don't stop being happy
Don't stop your clapping
Don't stop your laughing
Take a piece of life, it's alright
To hold back the night

From time to time, though we're whole worlds apart
You will still hold a groove in my heart
From time to time, we will fall side by side
You'll still have that look in your eye

Don't stop being happy
Don't stop your clapping
Don't stop your laughing
Don't stop your laughing
Don't stop your laughing
Don't stop your laughing
Don't stop your laughing
Take a piece of life, it's alright
To hold back the night
It's alright
To hold back the night
It's alright
To hold back the night
