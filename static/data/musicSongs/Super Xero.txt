So, what do you think?

[Mike Shinoda:]
What do I do to ignore what's behind me?
Do I follow my fate and escape blindly?
Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?

Do I let it go and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust none and live life in lonliness?

The sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men
I make the right turns but I'm lost within
I put on my daily faÃ§ade but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself
(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I can't hold on
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(when I'm against you I can't win)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Mike Shinoda:]
If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to give in to fate seems senseless
If I hide my pride I lie sleepless
And won't be able to cope with my weakness

If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself
(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I can't hold on
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(when I'm against you I can't win)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Mike Shinoda:]
How do you think that I've lost so much
Always afraid and I'm out of touch?
How do you expect that I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
Don't you (know)
I can't tell you how to make it (go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (try)
I can't seem to convince myself (why)
I'm stuck on the outside
[2x]

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
I can't hold on
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(when I'm against you I can't win)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

I can't hold on
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(when I'm against me I can't win)
With thoughts of failure from within
