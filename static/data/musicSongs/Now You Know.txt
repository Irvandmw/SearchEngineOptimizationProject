Lyrics:


In these eyes
More than words
More than anything that I've spoken
As the skies turned to gray 
My heart's just about to crack open
So the story goes
Thereâs something you should know
Before I walk away 
and I blow the ending

[Chorus]
I never wanna be without you
Oh no, here I go 
Now you know 
What I feel about you
there's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt you (You)
Oh no 
There I go 
No control
And Iâm fallen 
So now you know

Feel so light 
Craving oxygen 
All this truth's left me empty
Will you run
Can you handle it
Cause I need you to tell me
Maybe this is bold
But Iâm hoping youâll stay for the happy ending

[Chorus]
I never wanna be without you
Oh no, here I go 
Now you know 
What I feel about you
there's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt chu (You)
Oh no 
There I go 
No control
And Iâm fallen 
So now you know

No I wonât look back
When I tell you what I think about chu (You)
No I wonât look back 
When I tell you what I think about chu (You)

So the story goes
Yeah 
You already know
So donât be a fool
And go spoil the ending

[Chorus]
I never wanna be without you
Oh no, here I go 
Now you know 
What I feel about chu (you)
There's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt chu (You)
Oh no 
There I go 
No control
And Iâm fallen 
So now you know
[Chorus- Repeat twice]
