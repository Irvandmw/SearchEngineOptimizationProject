Lyrics:


[Chorus:]
Just set your sight high, look
'em right in the eye and take it
And make a big big big noise.
Don`t ask why
Just take it wise and making it
Make that a big big big big noise.

You can feel it in the air
Feel it everywhere
There`s a spirit moving
At just look, it`s all around you
Just take a look around you people stars ?? to loose it
Cos if you wanted you gotta go get it
Just to listen up
if there`s something that you need
You better believe

[Repeat chorus...]

Better make your play
Don`t let her thing like right or wrong, get it
Cos there`s nothing to it if you just if you reach out and do it, it`ll be ok
Just catch yourself a piece of the action
Just to listen up
if there`s something that you need
You better believe

[Repeat Chorus...]

Cos if you wanted you gotta go get it
Just to listen up
if there`s something that you need
You better believe
[Repeat chorus to fade...]
