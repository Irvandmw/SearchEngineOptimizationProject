Lyrics:


The rain is falling and the weather is cold
Don't know which way to go but i continue to roll (roll)
the rain fall is really taking a toll on my mind and my body and on my spirit and soul
the rains falling but I'm keeping a hold on the life cause i know that i could spin outta control
I know (know), I know (know), I know this is gonna be one rocky road

Ugh, what part of the voyage is this?
Friendship and business don't mix 
With anyone else it's just business with friends I'm personally pissed
Is this a curse or a gift?
Guess I was blessed with my wish
Don't tell me that u feel my pain
Then I say it's best that we switch
U take the fortune and fame and see if it's what u expected
Take the money and change and be careful where u invest it
Just take the test and don't stress it
You get stopped by a detective
Tryin to get in your personal life
Gotta do ur best to protect it
The answer rest in the message
When I go I go in a blaze
But it wont be no captain savin
Cause where I'm goin ur saved
Tryin to rain down on my parade
Till that umbrella get raised
They thinkin that they can read me when they ain't no where my page
Tryin to keep a smile on my face 
Even at times when I engage
In business conversations
With people I know are snakes
If life is a piece of cake part of the icing is venom
Spend a life time tryin to bring me down
But I just ain't gonna let em
You betta tell em

The rain is falling and the weather is cold
Don't know which way to go but I continue to roll (roll)
The rain fall is really taking a toll on my mind and my body and on my spirit and soul
The rains falling but I'm keeping a hold on the life cause I know that I could spin outta control
I know (know), I know (know), I know this is gonna be one rocky road

Ugh, I'm back and forth and I'm pacin
Being more patient than patience
Tryin to wait for the good news to show up
But I'm unfortunately waitin
Gotta be group participation
If its in the course that we makin
I was unfortunately done and she was unfortunately fakin
But the only sexual spark is the spark he got for the doe'
(doe)
They say till dill do us part but that part is where she says no
There are to many emotions
Emotions like pins and needles
Actin like emotions are evil
Like showin love is illegal
I thought that is was a eagle but i seen this vulture before
He thinks this is were ill stop cause he sees that im walkin slow
But no i think you should know that soon as I get where I go
You'll remember the fact that i had a purpose fo'sho

I hope you no where ur goin 
I hope u know that today
On the side of the road you gon see a whole lot of snakes
When the bad weather comes to rain down on ur parade
Just raise up ur umbrella and try to keep goin straight
(and keep the rain)

The rain is falling and the weather is cold
Don't know which way to go but i continue to roll (roll)
The rain fall is really taking a toll on my mind and my body and on my spirit and soul
The rains falling but I'm keeping a hold on the life cause I know that I could spin outta control
I know (know), I know (know), I know this is gonna be one rocky road

[Devin the Dude]
This road has many curves
Many bumps and potholes, it can even take u through a loop if u ain't got yo 
Sh*t together unpredictable weather can leave ya
Dehydrated, frost bitten, washed away, or either
Dan over by heavy traffic, watch where u roam
Cause it's a challenge just tryin to make it home
But still i walk i keep my paste i keep my stride
Would hitch-hike but there's to much pride
I must find a narrow path so i could walk and laugh out loud
Cry and sing with out bein judged by the crowd
Maybe some day i could just fly away
But for now ill just beat my feet and get there someway somehow
And mile after mile after mile ill smile
Keepin my head up even though rains porin down
And the road gets rough and the journey is long
I might get tired but i must move on

The rain is falling and the weather is cold
Don't know which way to go but i continue to roll (roll)
The rain fall is really taking a toll on my mind and my body and on my spirit and soul
The rains falling but I'm keeping a hold on the life cause I know that I could spin outta control
I know (know), I know (know), I know this is gonna be one rocky road

Most of our heroes are locked up
Diseased or deceased
We can never really remorse until somebody restin in peace
We measure the best by success and ain't impressed by nothin less
Only time we say we wanna change is when we ain't got no change left
Only time we call on God is when is nobody else to call
Keep stumblin over the same road block that just made ya fall
We always gotta wait until somethin happen before we start reactin
We at war with ourselves how much longer are we gonna be attackin?
