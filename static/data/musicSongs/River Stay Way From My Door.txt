Lyrics:


You keep goin' your way, I'll keep goin' my way
River, stay 'way from the door
I just got a cabin, you don't need my cabin
River, stay 'way from the door

Don't come up any higher, I'm so all alone
Leave the bed and the fire, that is all I own

I ain't breakin' your heart
Don't start breakin' my heart
River, stay 'way from the door

I'll keep goin' my way, you keep rollin' your way
River, stay 'way from the door
I just got me a cabin, you'll never need that cabin
River, stay 'way from the door

Don't you come up any higher, I'm so all alone
Leave the bed and the fire and you can have that phone
I ain't breakin' your heart, don't you start breakin' my heart
River, stay 'way from the door

Stay 'way, get 'way, roll 'way, stay 'way
You dirty, old, muddy river, you
River, stay 'way from the door
