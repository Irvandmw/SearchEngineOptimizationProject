Lyrics:


Then is here again
It's never been away so don't call it a comeback
Happy days of yore are all destroyed
And now it's looking like a sad sack

I can't believe that I couldn't see
How many dodgy men were on the TV
While I was growing to a man
They took advantage of the fans

When I was a boy
They were stars of prime time television
But circumstances change
And some of them ended up in prison

Now, when they re-run Top Of The Pops
Some of the hosts have got the chop
I'm sleeping soundly in my bed
'Cos Jimmy Savile's still dead

The swinging seventies
Used to sit on celebrities knees
The nineteen seventies
Sat on celebrities knees

Speculation began to roam
Like M.P.'s through a children's home
"How many more", "what did they do"
Where were the girls and boys in blue?

Now the victims and their families
Have retrospective apologies
They're told, that was then
It isn't now
We've slaughtered all those sacred cows

Then is here again
It's never been away so don't call it a comeback
Happy days of yore are all destroyed
And now it's looking like a sad sack

It's then again
Then again
