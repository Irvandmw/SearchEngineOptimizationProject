Lyrics:


When you're around
I can have a better life
When you're around
I can survive
When you're around
I can turn the world away
When you're around
I'm alive

I tune the world out with you
When you're around
I tune it out
I tune the world out with you
When you're around
I can turn the world away
When you're around
I tune it out

When I have love
I can drive the day away
When I have dreams
I can go far
When I have songs
I can fill an empty room
And I only need my guitar

I tune the world out with you
When you're around
I tune it out
I tune the world out with you
When you're around
I can turn the world away
When you're around
I tune it out

I tune the world out
I got no grief to bring me down
I tune the world out
I know it still but spin around
I tune the world out
I tune your love in
You make my world shout
You make my day begin
Because I know you love me
And it's plain to me
I'm a slave without you
But with you, I'm free

I tune the world out
I got no grief to bring me down
I tune the world out
I know it still but spin around
I tune the world out
I tune your love in
You make my world shout
You make my day begin
Because I know you love me
And it's plain to me
I'm a slave without you
But with you, I'm free

I tune the world out
I got no grief to bring me down
I tune the world out
I know it still but spin around
