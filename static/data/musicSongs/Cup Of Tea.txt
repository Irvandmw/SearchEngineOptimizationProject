Lyrics:


A cup of tea, a cup of tea
Iâve been driving all night, you wonât turn on your light that easily
A neon sign offers some shelter across the street
Guess Iâll drink my trouble down with a cup of tea

Youâre over me, youâre over me
I howl at your room like a wolf to the moon going crazy
Ring one more time, I wonât be off [?]
Guess Iâll sit and wait all night with my cup of tea

But itâs getting cold in here, 24 hours dear
Are you with someone else tonight?
Distance was killing me, I thought how surprised youâd be
I hope we make sweet love after we fight

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

I let it be, try to let it be
Iâll be hot to your touch, you say I think too much, call me âbabyâ
And itâll all be fine once you are walking up the street
âTil then Iâll sit and wait all night with my cup of tea

But darling, itâs getting cold in here, yeah, 24 hours dear
Are you with someone else tonight?
Distance was killing me, I thought how surprised youâd be
I hope we make sweet love after we fight

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

A cup of tea, a cup of tea
Sheâs holding your waist like sheâd give you a taste so easily
I wonât cry, no, Iâll just watch, and I will see
And Iâll say my last goodbye with a cup of tea
