Lyrics:


It's 7am, thinking about you
Wondering if the thoughts I'm feeling you're feeling too
Like a new born child, soft to the touch
Baby is it possible to love someone so much

I wish I may, I wish I might
Be that certain someone you wish for every night

[Chorus:]
If you knew what I knew
You wouldn't say what you said (say what you said)
If you knew what I knew
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady yes
If you knew what I knew

Time passes by
The only tears I cry
Are filled with disillusion and fears I have inside
Like a lost soul
I feel like I'm all alone (all alone)
If only I could feel your pain
Within your heart of stone

I wish I may, I wish I might
Be that certain someone you wish for every night

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Then you wouldn't have to go away
If you knew what I knew
Then you would be here to stay right by my side always

[Chorus]

If you knew what I knew my baby
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby
We would be together instead
[repeat to fade]
