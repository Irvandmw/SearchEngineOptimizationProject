Lyrics:


I hear the chimes playing the evening breeze,
Bringing the night along its way.
Just like the tide swaying the endless sea,
It keeps you forever from the day.

Haunt me tonight.
Float to me on your illusion.
Show me a sign to let me know.
Haunt me tonight.
Let me see your silent vision,
That's all of your light I have to hold.

I can't explain, can't even understand
How what we had has come to this.
When love's sweet refrain is played with a ghostly hand,
And I am so helpless to resist.

Haunt me tonight.
Float to me on your illusion.
Show me a sign to let me know.
Yeah, yeah.
Haunt me tonight.
Let me see your silent vision,
That's all of your light I have to hold.

[Guitar Interlude]

I feel you near, waiting beyond the shore,
Don't leave me longing anymore, ooh . . .

Haunt me tonight.
Float to me on your illusion.
Show me a sign to let me know.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Haunt me tonight.
Let me see your silent vision,
That's all of your light I have to hold.
Yeah.
Haunt me tonight.
Float to me on your illusion.
Show me a sign to let me know.
Haunt me tonight.
Let me see your silent vision,
That's all of your light I have to hold.
