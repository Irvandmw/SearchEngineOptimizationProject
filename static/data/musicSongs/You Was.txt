Lyrics:


[PL] If you were to ask me who the sweetest one I knew was
I'd say you was
[DM] If you were to ask me who my favorite point of view was
I'd say you was
[PL] When you're not near my heart is inclined to waste away
[DM] But when you're here the funny part is
My heart is a spherical lyrical miracle all the day
[PL] If you were to ask me who the apple of your eye was
I'd say I was
[DM] If you were to ask me who your sweet potato pie was
I'd say I was
[PL] Supposing you paid a visit to a certain preacher
[DM] Supposing you overheard me practicing "I do"
And you were to ask me who the bride and groom to be was
[PL] I'd say we was
[DM] Me and you
[PL] I've got a heart that hollers when you're not close to me
[DM] But when you're near it sorta follows
[Both] There isn't a lovelier heaven or bubblier place to be
[DM] If I were to ask you who the girl I'd glorify was
[PL] I'd say I was
[PL] If I were to ask you who the boy I'd like to tie was
[DM] I'd say I was
[PL] Supposing you heard that I was shopping for a trousseau
[DM] Supposing I bought you something old and something new
And you were to ask us who the bride and groom to be was
[PL] I'd say [Both] we was me and you
[PL] You was
[DM] You was
[PL] You was
[DM] I was
[Both] We was me and you
