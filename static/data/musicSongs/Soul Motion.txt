Lyrics:


I've got the fever
Poison in my veins
My mind ain't working right
I know the answer
The way to ease this pain
Only got myself to fight
I can see clearly
But choose to be blind
A slave to desire
Holding me, scolding me
Changing your mind
You're like playing with fire

[Chorus:]
I need you
I want to stay on
This soul motion ride
There is no danger when you're here by my side

Given some distance
Just a little time
Right and wrong seems clear
But my sense of reason is nothing
But unkind
Every time that you're near
Over and over I say to myself
Ooh, she's only playing
Ten thousand reasons to find someone else
Still I hear myself saying

[Chorus]

I'm out here on the edge
And I know what's in store
It should be over and done
Just let go and run
But I've tasted too much
Nothing's the same anymore

[Chorus]
