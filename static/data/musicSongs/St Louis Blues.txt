Lyrics:


I hate to see, that evenin' sun go down! 
I hate to see, that evenin' sun go down! 
'Cause my baby, gone and left this town! 

Feelin' tomorrow, just like I feel today, 
If I'm feelin' tomorrow, just like I feel today, 
I'll pack my trunk, and make my get-away! 

I went to the Gypsy, to get my fortune told,  
Yes, I went to the Gypsy, to get my fortune told, 
I asked the Gypsy, "What does the future hold?" 

Gypsy told me, "Don't you wear no black!"
Hmmm! The Gypsy told me, "Don't you wear no black!" (No black!) 
"Go to St. Louis, and you can win her back!" 

St. Louis woman, with her diamond rings, 

Pulls this man around by her apron strings, 

If it wasn't for powder and for store-bought hair, 
That gal I love wouldn't h've gone nowhere, nowhere! 

I got the St. Louis Blues, just as blue as I can be,
'Cause that gal's got a heart, like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else she wouldn't have gone so far from me! 

I love that gal like a school boy loves his pie, 
Like a Kentucky Colonel loves his mint an' his rye, 
I love that gal, yes I love that gal, 
Yes, I love that gal . . . 
Until  . . . the day . . . I die!
