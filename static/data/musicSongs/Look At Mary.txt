Lyrics:


Look at Mary comin' down the highway
Look at her runnin', are you goin' my way
Mary are you tryin' to find
A place to go, some peace of mind
Look at her run
Runnin', comin' undone

She's trying to get her mind together, she'd be glad to
But she couldn't tell you from me, If she had to
Mary are you tryin' to find
A place to go, some peace of mind
Look at her run
Runnin', comin' undone

Mary takes you by the hand
She can tell that you understand, yeah

There she is she's no where near together
'Cause the place she'd like to be is gone forever
Mary are you tryin' to find
A place to go, some peace of mind
Look at her run
Runnin', comin' undone

Look at Mary comin' down the highway
Look at her runnin', are you goin' my way
Mary are you tryin' to find
A place to go, some peace of mind
Look at her run
Runnin', comin' undone

Mary take me by the hand
I can tell that you understand, yeah
Mmm, yeah, mmm

Aw, get it Mary
