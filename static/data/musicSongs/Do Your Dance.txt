Lyrics:


I, I'm confident you'll find your groove
You, if you love yourself enough just move

Pay attention!
Right foot when the bass comes in
Left foot like you're marching
Break your back and look back at it while they all watching
'Cause you got what the whole world wants
And you don't give a fuck
Go and show them you the one

Baby do your dance
No, no, don't be afraid
D-d-d-do your dance
No, no, don't be afraid
D-d-d-do your dance (baby do your dance)
No, no, don't be afraid
D-d-d-do your dance
No, no, don't be afraid
D-d-d-do your dance
Ah

I, I love it when you're in your zone babe
And you, you look good when you dip down low

Give it to me, say!
Right foot when the bass comes in
Left foot like you're marching (hey)
Break your back and look back at it while they all watching (go)
'Cause you got what the whole world wants (hey)
And you don't give a fuck
Go and show them you the one

Baby do your dance
No, no, don't be afraid
