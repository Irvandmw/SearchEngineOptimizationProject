Lyrics:


What I need
You what I need (Ya, please)
I need a freak

Aye, I need a freak, freak, freak to rub my hair, hair (Rub my hair)
Aye, I need a freak every day of the week with her legs in the air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, I want a freak, (Bee-yatch!) freak who just don't care (Who just don't care)
Aye, I need a freak with a big ass butt make all the niggas stare (All the niggas stare)

I need a freak, bounce to the beat
Ya, freak hoe, tell me what to eat, ya
Freak girl, tell me where to sleep
Swallow on the meat, mmm, tell me if it's sweet, ya
I like a freak, do it in the car, leave cum on the seat
Do it in the dark, I don't even wanna see
Open up your door I got a big ass key, ya
Like a freak though, baby bring your niece (Bring your niece)
So nice, make her say please (Say please)
Like a lolli, lick it til' it's clean
She looked at me, said, "Baby what you mean?"
(What you mean?)

Aye, I need a freak, freak, freak to rub my hair, hair (Rub my hair)
Aye, I need a freak every day of the week with her legs in the air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, I want a freak, (Bee-yatch!) freak who just don't care (Who just don't care)
Aye, I need a freak with a big ass butt make all the niggas stare (All the niggas stare)

Aye, aye
Oh you lookin' for a freak? I'm the biggest one
I can do a trick you ain't know make you cum
Big ghetto booty, boujee, choosey
Ain't giving up the pussy for a dinner and a movie
I need me a nasty ass nigga that don't care
Fuckin' with my ex 'cause I had the niggas scared
You ain't eating what you here for, baby I'm a nympho
Known to keep a nigga on rock like a Flinstone
Real freaks don't trip, they cum and then dip
Treat 'em like party favors, I pass 'em like chips
Get my nut, then what, I'm back to business
A good lick, hella trick that's all that he is

Aye, I need a freak, freak, freak to rub my hair, hair (Rub my hair)
Aye, I need a freak every day of the week with her legs in the air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, I want a freak, (Bee-yatch!) freak who just don't care (Who just don't care)
Aye, I need a freak with a big ass butt make all the niggas stare (All the niggas stare)

Aye, I got a bitch named Ashley, she don't even ask me
Suck a nigga off with Brittany in the backseat
Brand new bitch paparazzi think she Cassie
Tell her make it nasty, spit like Daffy
I ain't Billie Jean, but the bitch call me Daddy
Diamonds in my ear got me feeling like Gatsby
House full of hoes you can only imagine
5 in the morning getting ghosts like Casper

I need a freak (Yeah) to rub my hair, hair, hair (Rub my hair)
Aye, I need a freak every day of the week with her legs in the air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, I want a freak, (Bee-yatch!) freak who just don't care (Who just don't care)
Aye, I need a freak with a big ass butt make all the niggas stare (All the niggas stare)

Aye, I need a freak, freak, freak to rub my hair, hair, hair
I need a freak every day of the week with her legs in the air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, I want a freak, (Bee-yatch!) freak who just don't care (Who just don't care)
Aye, I need a freak with a big ass butt make all the niggas stare (All the niggas stare)
