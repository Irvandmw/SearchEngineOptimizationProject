Lyrics:


When you're down, I'm the first to know it
You turn around, then you take aim on me
Scream and shout, I'm not afraid to take it (oh)
We've gotta be stronger than pride
We can't bruise as easily

Hey
Won't you come and sit down next to me
Put your head on my chest, baby breathe
You don't have to hide your tears from me

Hey
You know I'm gonna
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Swear I'ma prove it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit, I'll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Never gone lose it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
I know you've had it hard
You've seen it fall apart
Love is never easy
But, I swear to God
I know I'm gonna
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit I'll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)

I know I can drive you close to crazy (yeah)
You've seen me battle my demons too (oh)
A beautiful life isn't always pretty (hey)
But I'll fight for this love as long as I'm fighting with you (hey)

Hey
Won't you come and sit down next to me
Put your head on my chest, baby breathe
I'll give you a reason to believe

Hey
You see I'm gonna
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Swear I'ma prove it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit, I'll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Never gone lose it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
I know we've had it hard
You've seen me fall apart
Love is never easy
But, I swear to God
You know I'm gonna
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit I'll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)

All this broken glass is the evidence
We're not innocent, we still make perfect sense
In the aftermath, I'll be here after that
And after that

You know I'm gonna
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Swear I'ma prove it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit, I'll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Never gone lose it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
They've never seen before
Two hearts that bleed, it's true
A legendary love, this I swear to you

I know I'm gonna
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit, I'll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
