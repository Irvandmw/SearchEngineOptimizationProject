Lyrics:


Now that they are gone, you know the truth it can be told
They were sacrificial lambs in the market place sold

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel

Now that they are gone, you know the truth it can come out
They were never proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel

The people thought they were guilty at the time
Some even said there hadn't been any crime

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel

People look upon this couple with contempt and doubt
But they loved each other right up to the time they checked out

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel

Eisenhower was president, Senator Joe was king
Long as you didn't say nothing, you could say anything

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel

Now, some they blamed the system, some they blamed the man
Now that it is over, no one knows how it began

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel

Every kingdom got to fall, even the Third Reich
Man can do what he please but not for as long as he like

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel

Well, they say they gave the secrets of the atom bomb away
Like no one else could think of it, it wouldn't be here today

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel

Someone said the 50s was the age of great romance
I say that's just a lie, it was when fear had you in a trance

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel

[Solo]

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel
[x13]

[Solo]

Julius and Ethel
Julius and Ethel
[x5]
