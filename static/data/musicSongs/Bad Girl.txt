[Trey Songz:]
Yeah, yeah
I like it

[A Boogie With Da Hoodie & Trey Songz:]
'Cause you've been a bad girl, yeah, a bad girl
Girl, I still fuck with you even though you've been a bad girl
I wanna teach you a listen
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl
'Cause you've been a bad girl
You've been a bad girl
Girl, I still fuck with you even though you've been a bad girl
I wanna teach you a listen
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl
'Cause you've been a bad girl
You've been a bad girl
And you've been a bad girl
You've been a bad, bad, bad girl (You've been a bad girl)
You've been a bad girl, you've been a bad girl

I thought I was lovin' it
I was in lost with it, told her that I cannot fuck with it
She like how I'm modest and she call me Artist
I love when she scream out my government name
I met her at Anex, I took her to my place
We fucked, then popped bottles of bubbly
She ended up popping the percs, she was wildin', I think she just wanted some company
I will not blame you for not resisting
You know I've been looking for time to kick it
Busy on Instagram liking pictures
You need to stop playing, and come and visit
I need your location inside the DM (the DM)
Your friends in the back they like go and see ya
I seen her how sweet she was looking mixy
She was Cuban and Puerto Rican (Ahah)
And I need a bad bad girl
A no strings attached bad girl
I gotta teach her a lesson (Teach her)
Go ahead and grab that, girl

Girl, I still fuck with you even though you've been a bad girl (So bad)
I wanna teach you a listen
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl
'Cause you've been a bad girl
You've been a bad girl (Ohh)
Girl, I still fuck with you even though you've been a bad girl
I wanna teach you a listen
Tell me to slow down if I'm goin' fast, girl
I know you want me to sweat you
I might undress you and run you a bath, girl
'Cause you've been a bad girl
You've been a bad girl
And you've been a bad girl
You've been a bad, bad, bad girl (You've been a bad girl)
You've been a bad girl, you've been a bad girl

[Trey Songz:]
She say she love when I'm touching it, love when I'm touching it, feel like I'm ducking it
She stay I stay up in her head, but I'm playing with her head
And she finna be down with it
Woah now, woah now, baby slow down, you talking crazy
Woah now, woah now, baby slow down, I got you, bae
You just need a lil' spanking from your daddy (Teach you)
Next time all you gotta do is ask me

[A Boogie With Da Hoodie & Trey Songz:]
Girl, I still fuck with you even though you've been a bad girl

'Cause you've been a bad girl
You've been a bad girl
Girl, I still fuck with you even though you've been a bad girl
