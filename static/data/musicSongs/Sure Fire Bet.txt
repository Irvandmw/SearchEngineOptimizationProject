Lyrics:


Yeah you're a
Sure fire bet to win my lips
A sure fire bet to win my heart
A sure fire bet to make me start
To fall in love with you

'Cause you've got everything to make my heart sing
You've got those dreamy eyes that promise paradise
And when you hold my hand baby, it's oh so grand
And the odds get greater that you'll win me sooner or later

You're a
Sure fire bet to win my lips
A sure fire bet to win my heart
A sure fire bet to make me start
To fall in love with you

Yeah you're a
Sure fire bet to win my lips
A sure fire bet to win my heart
A sure fire bet to make me start
To fall in love with you

And when you kiss my lips baby, I know for sure, not maybe
That I'm in heaven with an angel by my side
And when I sleep at night, I dream I'm holdin' you tight
And I know I don't have a chance, you win
Why should I fight

'Cause you're a
Sure fire bet to win my lips
A sure fire bet to win my heart
A sure fire bet to make me start
To fall in love with you

Yeah you're a
Sure fire bet to make me start
To fall in love with you
