Lyrics:


You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my
I love you but I donât know whyâ¦

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Donât let it stopâ¦

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Donât let it stopâ¦

He had a cigarette with his number on it
He gave it over to me, âDo you want it?â
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it
I saved it, I waited, I called it
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous
I knew it was wrong, Iâm beyond it
I tried to be strong but I lost it.

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, myâ¦

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Donât let it stopâ¦

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Donât let it stopâ¦

He has a white Corvette like I want it
A fire in his eyes, no, I saw it
Heâs bleeding from his brain and his wallet
Heâs sick and heâs taken but honest
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on his lips I just canât resist
As close as Iâll get to the darkness
He tells me to âShut up, I got this.â

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, myâ¦

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Donât let it stopâ¦

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Donât let it stopâ¦

I need you, I need you babe
Like I never needed anyone
Youâre wrong but youâre so much fun
You say you treat 'em mean to keep 'em keen â you're not that nice

But you taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, myâ¦

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Donât let it stopâ¦

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Donât let it stopâ¦
