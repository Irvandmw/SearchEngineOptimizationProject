Lyrics:


Your Unbelievable..

Check the method when I constantly flow,
No joke like the pronto, loud so,
John Doe up in his condo in Toronto,
Can hear the way foot comes down,
Just to give you the run down,
Krutch be droppin' it, daybreak to sundown,
When the smoke clears,
Who you think'll be standin' there?
Grippin' four mics,
Swingin' the cords up in the air,
Like cowboys,
We be rockin' the territory in this rap game,
'n' CHRIST blessed us with the octane,
The same name,
Who created the world in seven days,
Will change ya life, you'd be amazed,
Man, don't trip, we gon' carry on with the function,
Krutch preparin' the power punch 'n'

[Chorus]
The things, you say,
Your words will never push me away,
The things, you say,...
You're unbelivable,... you're so unbelievable

I just wanna make jams,
To pack the clubs 'n' stadiums,
With people of all types,
While makin' the crowd hype,
I got CHRIST in me, for the life of me,
Stand truly thankful for the sites I see,
'n' sparks be ignitin',
The minute we start writin',
GOD placed me in this fightin',
To speak 'n' to enlighten,
And I'm just that type-a, lyrical rhyme
Sniper, never a street fighter,
But down for gettin' hyper,
I'm a beat junkie brother, known by the emcee's,
For rippin' thru tracks like epidemic disease,
And shout to J.C. cuz' he reigns supreme,
'n' party people out there know what I mean.

[chorus]

Check this out, check this out,
Stepped on the scene, at the age of thirteen,
Crystal-clean, kick it like ya never seen,
Big expansion, that mmm bopped hanson,
'n' thru off Marylin Manson up in his mansion,
Out to rock the globe,
While its still here to rock,
With things that'll make ya drop ya jaw,
Run along 'n' lock ya door,
It's the Krutch coalition crowd,
On a mission now,
Original, givin' emcee's beat downs,
We bust, with the extreme thrust,
Of ten warriors, the notorious,
One triple zero, no joke, we let it flow,
Man for real though,
Steppin' on sneakers with steel toes.

[chorus]
