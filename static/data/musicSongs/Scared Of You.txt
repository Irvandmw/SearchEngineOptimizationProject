Lyrics:


I'm sorry I forsake you
I'm sorry that I left you
I'm sorry I did forget you
And I'm sorry that I made myself feel better
By making you feel never good enough
I know you'll shine much brighter than I ever could
Maybe that is why I was

[Chorus:]
Scared of you (and in everything I do I'm still thinking of you) oh, you
And I know you were scared of me 
(but everytime I tried to love you I just fell through) too

Desculpa-me se eu te -ofendi
Desculpa-me se eu te -esqueci
Desculpa-me se-eu te-deixei
se eu te-deixei
E desculpa-me por me sentir bem com tua dor
Sabes que te-adore mais sei que a tu estrela a maior do que a minha, 
do que minha (a minha, muito mais do que a minha, yeah)
E por isso

[Chorus:]
Eu tenho medo deste amor (os dias que passo pensando en ti) amor
Medo deste amor (Salve-me porque agora estou caindo) amor

Scared of you I was
Scared of you I was
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
