Lyrics:


Here in my arms
You can say anything you want
And don't ever think
In the morning it could all be gone

The radio's playing that song
And around me you'll always belong
Oh baby don't try this so long
Remember it will always be me
Driving you home
Driving you home

I've never been so sure that heaven is on the other side
Wherever I lived before your body made me come alive

The radio's playing that song
And around me you'll always belong
Oh baby don't try this so long
Remember it will always be me

Driving you home
Driving you home
Driving you home
Driving you home

I'm driving you home
I'm driving you home tonight
Let no-one else
Take your love for a ride
Let's go

The radio's playing that song
And around me you'll always belong
Oh baby don't try this so long
Remember it will always be me
Driving you home

Say anything you want
Would have woke up without you or not
Oh baby don't try so long
Remember it will always be me driving you home
Driving you home

Driving you home
Driving you home
