Lyrics:


No, I don't say it often
And I probably should've told you I hurt this bad, I know
And I probably shouldn't want this so bad
It's weighing, weighing on me
Don't wanna wake up in the mornin'
Cannot undo what we did in this bed
And I can't get you out, so I gotta go
No, I'm not ready for, you want me all alone
But I'm undecided, excited, ignited
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flyin'
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

I know I shouldn't be doing this, but here we go again
Girl you know that pussy is my weakness (Weakness, weakness)
Girl, you got me addicted when you switchin' position
You tell me, "Shut up"
And you know I listen, I hit it
Wish I never did it
I can't keep sinnin' and pretendin'

I'm takin' off your clothes
We gettin' sexual
Hit it so good, think I'll propose
I don't know

But I'm undecided, excited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flyin' (All these, all these)
But I'm still indecisive ('Cause you want me)
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Oh, no, I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
I said I just don't know
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Ay 'cause I'm undecided
No, no, baby
I'm afraid of your love
Ooh, you got me baby
'Cause I can't get enough

But I'm undecided, excited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flyin'
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

No, no, oh, no, and I want it (I'm undecided)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, ayy
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

No, no, no, no
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, but I'm undecided
