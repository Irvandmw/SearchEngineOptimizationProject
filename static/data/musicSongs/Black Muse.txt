Lyrics:


Black Muse can eye talk to you
What eye got to share is mighty good news
A brand new day is dawning
But you and me know what to do
(so much work to do)

Black Muse we've been so abused
Our mothers were good-looking and our fathers were to
But if they don't stay together
We can't walk no better in these shoes
(Black Muse)

Long ago 2 men held one of us down
Another took a whip and made a terrible sound
Baby watched her father falling down to the ground
That was you and me.

Black Muse can eye share with you
Just came this morning and it's mighty good news
They tipped the hour glass
Now everything is passed
It's true.

They gave the world back to you and me
The faces on the mountains and a dirty sea
A trillion dollar bill and no currency
Still we believe

Black Muse we gonna make it thru
Surly people that created rhythm and blues
Rock and roll and jazz
So you know we're built to last
It's cool.. it's cool.. it's cool..
(Black Muse)

A new day is dawning
Black Muse
A new day is dawning
Black Muse

Now that eye got your attention
Eye think its 'bout time eye mention
The reason why eye wrote this song
Like a UFO sighting
From my heart eye am writing
The next close encounter
Tell me how long
Will it be on land or near the water
Will it produce the sun or the black moon daughter
Or a pillow covered with all our tears
1000 light years away from here
(1000 light years from here)

No yesterday or tomorrow
No better remedy for sorrow
Or why the 5th held forever will make you cry
Eye don't know why

1000 light years from here
(1000 light years from here)

2 unbroken circles joined together make a butterfly
Little darling don't you wanna try? (yeah I wanna try)
There ain't nothing better than looking for me (for me to)
And seeing you (seeing me)
Seeing you in the mirror
1000 light years away from here

Why do we always seem so far away?
When you know that eye really wanna be with you night and day
I'm running out of ways to say how
So eye think I'll just close
For now.
