Lyrics:


Oh, I'm a wandering soul
I'm still walking the line
That leads me home
Alone

All I know
I still got mountains to climb
On my own
On my own

Do you love me enough to let me go?
Do you love me enough to let me go?
To let me follow through
Let me fall for you, my love
Do you love me enough to let me go?

Back from the dead of winter
Back from the dead and all our leaves are dry
You're so beautiful tonight

Do you love me enough to let me go?

Back from the dead we went through
Back from the dead and both our tongues are tied
You look beautiful tonight

Do you love me enough to let me go?

But every seed dies before it grows

Do you love me enough to let me go?
Do you love me enough to let me go?
To let me follow through
To let me fall for you, my love
Do you love me enough to let me go?

Breathe it in and let it go
Every breath you take is not yours to own
It's not yours to hold
Do you love me enough to let me go?

Do you love me enough to let me go?
Do you love me enough to let me go?
And to let me follow through
To let me fall for you, my love
Do you love me enough to let me go?
