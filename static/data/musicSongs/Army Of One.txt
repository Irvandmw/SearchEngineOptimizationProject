Lyrics:


Iâm in this war
But got no gun
Still standing strong
An army of one
So sign me up
Iâm a soldier

Iâve got a voice
Itâs all I need
A beating heart inside of me
Iâm an army of one
Iâm a soldier

These eyes hold no disguise
Weâre fighting for our lives
Weâre all trying to get back home tonight

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never give up
Never let up
Ever
Never give in
Youâre an army of one

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never forget
Where youâre from
Never give up
Youâre an army of one

I canât hurt but I still feel
I know that lifeâs a battlefield
When the times get tough
Iâm a soldier

And when itâs time to face the fight
With just my shadow at my side
Iâm an army of one
Iâm a soldier

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never give up
Never let up
Ever
Never give in
Youâre an army of one

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never forget
Where youâre from
Never give up
Youâre an army of one

So don't apologize
Defend, just be alive
Weâre all trying
To get it right tonight

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never give up
Never let up
Ever
Never give in
Youâre an army of one

Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never forget
Where youâre from
Never give up
Youâre an army of one
