Lyrics:


[Mark:]
Everybody's got an answer to a question that they need to know
"Still broken over one thing I didn't ask you do you have to go?"
Now I'm looking for a reason, it isn't easy but I gotta have hope
Sometimes it can be harder to remember than to just let go
Always seems to be something to remind me what I miss the most
"Cause you are the one thing I believed in when it all falls down."

[All:]
So if you got a candle you better light it now
And if you gotta voice you better shout out loud
Raise your hands above this crowd and I will reach you
Can you hear me can you hear me now?

[Shane:]
Even though I can't see you I can feel you after all this time
So baby if you're hurting all I'm asking for is just one sign
Cause I never met anyone who was lost but didn't wanna be found.
So if you got a candle you better light it now
And if you gotta voice you better shout out loud
Raise your hands above this crowd and I will reach you
Can you hear me can you hear me? I will reach you, 
Can you hear me can you hear me now?

Light it up (I will reach you)
Shout out loud (I will reach you)
Raise your hands above this crowd

[Chorus]
