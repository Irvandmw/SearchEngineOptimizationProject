Lyrics:


Every day will be like a holiday
When my baby
When my baby comes home

She's been gone
Such a long time
Ever since she's been gone
She's been on my mind
I got a letter Just about noon
She said don't you worry darling
I'll be home soon

Every day will be like a holiday
When my baby
When my baby comes home

I never have to worry
I am Sitting by the phone
When she gets here
I'll never be alone
She said she'll get here sometime today
I know when she gets here
She'll never go away

Every day will be like a holiday
When my baby
When my baby comes home
Every day will be like a holiday
When my baby
When my baby comes home
Every day will be like a holiday
When my baby
When my baby comes home
Every day will be like a holiday
Every day will be like a holiday
Every day will be like a holiday
Every day will be like a holiday
Every day will be like a holiday
Every day will be like a holiday
(Every day will be like a holiday)
