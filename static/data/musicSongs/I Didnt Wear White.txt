Lyrics:


Shame, shame little girl, I would her say
No cookies for you today, you better go outside and play
Or you won't wear white on your wedding day
Well I was 16, the phone would ring, we'd say I know it's Romeo
All the kids are down by the lake, hey baby do you wanna go
We'll laugh and dance and make romance and no one has to know

She's say one, twice, girl you better be nice
Don't trust that boy named Ray
He'll use you up and throw you away
And you won't wear white on your wedding day

How I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
What you told our family, what you told our friends
In her house, you know I couldn't stay
I couldn't look at her, I had to look away

And I didn't wear white on my wedding day

Mama'd say one, twice, girl you better be nice
Don't trust that boy named Ray
He'll use you up and throw you away and you
Won't wear white on your wedding day

And I didn't wear white on my wedding day
No I didn't wear white on my wedding day
