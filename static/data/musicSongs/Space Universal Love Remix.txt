Lyrics:


How did I get in this predicament?
How did I get in this jam?
The person that they accuse me of being of
That's not the one I really am
I am the one that really loves you
With all my mind body and soul
With every stroke of my brush
I wanna paint a wall around you
So that you will never know

All the pain that a human has to go thru
In a planet that's so bitter and cold
Universal love awaits you baby
All you got to say is that you really really really wanna go
And we're outta here

The space
Do you wanna?
Do you want to go?
Where the Sun's go
Where the tears flow
Where the love grows
Do you want to go?

How did I let you hypnotize me?
Did it have anything to do with your lips?
Did it have anything to do with your cool disposition?
Did it have anything to do with your kiss?
Where in the world did you learn to put your arms around me and cause my temperature to rise?
Sometimes I get the feeling this was all meant to be
Just like the sun and moon, you and I

All the pain that a human has to go thru
In a planet that's so bitter and cold (so cold)
Universal love awaits you
Baby all you gotta say is that you really really really wanna go
And we're outta here

The space
Do you wanna
Do you want to go
Where the Sun's go
Where the tears flow
Where the love grows
Do you want to go?

(Crooked letter, crooked letter, crooked letter I...)

This is the space where my love goes
Look up lay back and let the wild flow
This is the space where my hands go
If they're too hot the water should be cold
This is the space where the cream flows
Over my shoulder till my friend grows
On and on till we both know
Universal love in the 94

Do you wanna?
