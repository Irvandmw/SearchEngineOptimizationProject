Lyrics:


Ain't she a honey
Gonna spend all the money
I got, why not?
Ain't she a ripper
With a buckle and a zipper
She's hot, a lot
Ain't she my baby
Every night and every day-be
She means what she say-be
She don't mean maybe
Ain't she a honey
Gonna spend all the money I got

Ain't she a looker
In a steam pressure cooker
All day, the say
Ain't she a squeezer
An almighty teaser
All night, that's right
Ain't she a slacker
A slim firecracker
A dark horsebacker
A late-night snacker
Ain't she a honey
Gonna spend all the money I got

Ain't she a honey
If you want her to keep up
You better count your money
'Cause she don't come cheap

Now if she loves you
She's gonna let you inside
And then she'll take you
On an airplane ride

Ain't she a flyer
And a girl on a wire
She's neat on her feat
Ain't she a flower
And a hot summer shower
She's cool, you fool
Ain't she a dresser
A moonlight caresser
A big head messer
I say God bless her
Ain't she a honey
Gonna spend all the money I got
Ain't she a honey
Gonna spend all the money I got
Ain't she a honey
Spend all the money I got
