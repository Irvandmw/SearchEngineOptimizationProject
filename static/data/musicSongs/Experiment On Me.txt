Lyrics:


I'll let you think you get the picture
Bitch, you don't know how good I treat ya
Shake it off, this pride and glory
You dig up so many stories

Oh, you're so under the thumb
Four fingers from a knuckle sandwich
Trying my blood, it's just a starter
No one tastes like me, yeah

I'm pretty like a car crash
Ugly as a lullaby
You really wanna try it
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me

I've been way too much to handle
Bitch, I've never been a good example
Seen not heard is what they told me
I look too good to be this lonely

Oh grab this loaded gun
So hopeless but I'm still a romantic
Bloodstained mouth, I'm gonna blow a kiss
And I bet it tastes like me, yeah

I'm pretty like a car crash
Ugly as a lullaby
You really wanna try it
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me

Lock up your sons, make way for the daughters
You be the lamb and we'll be the slaughter
You burned the witches, now you're defenseless
Who needs a Y with this many X's
Lock up your sons, make way for the daughters
You be the lamb and we'll be the slaughter
You burned the witches, now you're defenseless
Who needs a Y with this many X's
Lock up your sons, make way for the daughters
You be the lamb and we'll be the slaughter
You burned the witches, now you're defenseless
Who needs a Y with this many X's
Who needs a Y with this many X's
Who needs a Y with this many X's
Who needs a Y with this many X's
Who needs a Y with this many X's

I'm pretty like a car crash
Ugly as a lullaby
You really wanna try it
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
