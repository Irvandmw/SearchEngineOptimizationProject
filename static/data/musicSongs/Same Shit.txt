Lyrics:


I wouldn't trust anybody after that

I'll take you to the promised land (yeah, uh-huh)
Elevate your mind, body and your soul, girl (soul)
To the promised land (uh-huh)
Elevate your mind, body and your soul, girl

Ain't no other feeling better than you here, girl (oh yeah)
I swear, I'm up late night scrolling through your pictures
Wanna know, wanna know if I'm still on your mind
Going through your favorite places hoping I would run into you, I can't lie

It's the same shit, just a different day
I keep thinkin' 'bout you, oh
Same shit, just a different girl
But ain't nothing like you, oh (oh, woo)
Do you love me? Oh baby, do you?
Do you love me? Me, me, what about me?

I dedicate, dedicate this to you (oh)
For every word, I ever said to you (oh)
All you ever wanted was a shoulder
You can hold on, oh yeah, oh yeah, girl

Ain't no other feeling better than you here, girl (you here, girl)
Got a nigga fucked up when I'm scrolling through your pictures
Wondering if I'm still on your mind
Try to have this conversation with the love of my life but it's the

Same shit, just a different day
I keep thinkin' 'bout you ('bout you)
Same shit, just a different girl
But ain't nothing like you, oh (oh)
Do you love me? love me? (Yeah)
Do you love me? Do you love? Me, me, what about me?

I dedicate, dedicate this to you (oh)
For every word, I ever said to you (oh)
All you ever wanted was a shoulder
You can hold on, oh yeah, oh yeah, girl

Ain't no other feeling better than you here, girl (you here, girl)
Got a nigga fucked up when I'm scrolling through your pictures
Wondering if I'm still on your mind
Try to have this conversation with the love of my life but it's the

Same shit, it's the same shit, girl, you know it is
Don't be acting stuck up, you gotta let it go
Give a damn 'bout your pride
I've been thinking 'bout you
My nightmares, I'm dreaming 'bout you
I might have to see the doctor
'Cause I can't make it 'til tomorrow

Same shit, just a different day
I keep thinkin' 'bout you
Same shit, just a different, girl
But, ain't nothing like you (oh, oh)
Do you love me? Love me (yeah)
Do you love me? Me, me, what a hoe

It's the same shit, just a different day
I keep thinkin' 'bout you
Same shit, just a different girl
But, ain't nothing like you (oh, oh)
Do you love me?
Do you love me? Me
