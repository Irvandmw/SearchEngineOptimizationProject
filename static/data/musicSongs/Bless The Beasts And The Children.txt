Lyrics:


Bless the beasts and the children 
For in this world they have no voice, 
They have no choice! 

Bless the beasts and the children, 
For the world can never be, 
A world they see! 

Light their way, 
When the darkness surrounds them, 
Give them love, 
And let it shine all around them! 

Bless the beasts and the children, 
Give them shelter from the storm, 
Keep them safe, 
And keep them warm!
