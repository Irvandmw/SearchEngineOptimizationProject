Lyrics:


If you want my sympathy, just open your heart to me
You'll get whatever you'll ever need
You think that's too high for you, oh baby I'd die for you
When there's nothin' left you know where I'll be

Lay back in the arms someone
Give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
Lay back in the arms someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love

So baby, just call on me, when you want all of me
I'll be your lover, I'll be your friend
You think that's too high for you, but baby I'll die for you
When there's nothin' left you know where I'll be

Lay back in the arms someone
Give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
Lay back in the arms someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love

Lay back in the arms someone
Give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
Lay back in the arms someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
