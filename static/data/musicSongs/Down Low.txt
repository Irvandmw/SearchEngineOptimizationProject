Lyrics:


Can I get to know you babe?
Can I get to know you babe?
Show you things, you think you seeing dreams
But just don't tell your team
Keep it on the down low, keep-keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low, keep it on the down low
Down low
Keep it on the down low

Know we're slow baby, I'll be you're shotty body
I'll let you do the naughty, make me go, "ladidadi"
Don't tell them secrets, I'll give 'em reasons to keep 'em bay
But this ain't creeping, nah ah, this is just freaking
Papa, see you every weekend, ah ah
And I'm speaking, you and me can make sure nobody peaking
So can I get to know

Can I get to know you babe?
Show you things, you think you seeing dreams
But just don't tell your team
Keep it on the down low, keep-keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low, keep it on the down low
Down low
Keep it on the down low

So touch me baby, let's get this party started
I'll show you how I ride it
Let you know I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
You got me fiendin', a perfect reason for pleasin' babe
I hear you breathin' in my ear, you got me screamin' babe
Baby boy I'm trying to know ya
See the shotgun that you hide in ya holster
We can get down on the ground, little sober
Do you got time for an hour of Doja?
So many things that I'm dyin' to show ya
No pics when I sign for exposure
Just ridin' over and over and over

Can I get to know you babe?
Show you things, you think you seeing dreams
But just don't tell your team
Keep it on the down low, keep-keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low, keep it on the down low
Down low
Keep it on the down low

Just don't say a thing, we'll be safe on the low
Let them run the bait, Mr. wait, keeps us close
Just don't say a thing, we'll be safe on the low
Let them run the bait, Mr. wait, keeps us close

Can I get to know you babe?
Show you things, you think you seeing dreams
But just don't tell your team
Keep it on the down low, keep-keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low, keep it on the down low
Down low
Keep it on the down low
