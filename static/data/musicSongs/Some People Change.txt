Lyrics:


His old man was a rebel yeller, bad boy to the bone, and say canât trust a color feller, he
judge em by the tone of their skin. He was raised to think like his dad narrow mind full of
hate on the road to no where fast till the grace of god got in the way then he saw the light n
hit heâs knees n cried and said a prayer, rose up a brand new man n left the old one right
there 

[Chorus:]
Hereâs to the strong, thanks to the brave donât give up hope some people change
against all odds, against the grain love finds a way, some people change 

She was born with her mothers habit guess you can say its in her blood she hates it that
sheâs gotta have it she fills a glass up n she love to kill that bottle but all she could
think about is a better life, a second chance for everyone sheâs letting down she throws that
bottle down 

[Chorus:]
Hereâs to the strong, thanks to the brave donât give up hope Some people change
against all odds, against the grain love finds a way, some people change

Thank god for those who make it let them be the lightâ¦

Some people change 

Hereâs to the strong, thanks to the brave donât give up hope Some people change, against all
odds against the grain, love finds a way, some people change 

Some people change
Some people changeâ¦
