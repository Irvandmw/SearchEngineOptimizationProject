Lyrics:


Just lay it all down on me
Itâs getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me

And you know Iâve learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
Canât keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find whatâs there beyond the pale

I feel like Iâve gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?

You know Iâve learned from my mistakes
How much have I got to lose?
You find my heart hard to break
Canât keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find whatâs there beyond the pale

What can I do
Just to let you know
That youâre in my mind?
To try and justify
The way you liberate me
Every time
