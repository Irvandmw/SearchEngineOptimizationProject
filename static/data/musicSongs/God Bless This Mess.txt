Lyrics:


I got some blood under my nails, I got some mud on my face
My voice is shot I'm going grey, these muscles all ache

Don't cry for me, I'm the life of the party
I'm smiling most of the time
I may be gritting my teeth, can't get back where we started
These days I'm doing just fine

God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess, I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine

I knew every buried body paid for each head stone
I may have led the prayers in public but I cried alone

Found God through sin but this ain't my confession
I'll wait on judgement day
It's lose or win, got no need for protection
Stand up or out of my way

God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess, I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine

The howling dooms day dogs
Are snapping at your feet
Round here the sky is cracked
But won't admit defeat
Down here there they got your back
And still they're at your side
This treasure chest of rags
Still keeps this dream alive

God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess, I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
