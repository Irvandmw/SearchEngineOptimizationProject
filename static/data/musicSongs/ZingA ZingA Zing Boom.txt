Lyrics:


(Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-boom)
(Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom)
A funny melody that keeps you singing
(Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom)
And in your memory it keeps on ringing
(Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom)
Can work a charm on arm and arm when two hearts are clinging
So take the one you love and start to dance
You will find a one way ticket to romance
While music is playing and dancers are swaying
The gay cabellero may feel cupid's arrow
You dance with a new love you may find a true love
Who will say I do love and make your heart go zing-a zing-a boom

(Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom)
You can't escape it once the music gets you
(Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom)
You can't forget it for it never lets you
(Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom)
And if you're worried or anything upsets you
There's one thing that will chase away the blues
Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom

While music is playing and dancers are swaying (zing-a zing-a boom)
The gay cabellero may feel cupid's arrow (zing-a zing-a boom)
You dance with a new love you may find a true love (zing-a zing-a boom)
Who will say I do love and make your heart go zing-a zing-a boom (zing-a zing-a boom)

(Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom)
Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom
(You can't escape it once the music gets you
Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom
(Can't forget it for it never lets you)
Zing-a zing-a zing-a zing-a zing boom
And if you're worried or anything upsets you
There's one thing that will chase away the blues
(Zing-a zing-a boom zing-a zing-a boom zing-a zinga-boom)
Zing-a zing-a boom boom
