I'm lookin' paid and pretty (Yeah)
Hair hanging down to my back (Huh!)
I put it on him last night (Woo!)
He calling me back to back (Hey, hey)
Bitch this is a new outfit (Yeah)
Turn to the back for a pic (Huh!)
Cognac Queen, I'm lit (Woo!)

She pulling up with a forty (A forty)
I'm pulling up with a shortie (A shortie)
I'm fresh off the plane, I'm imported (Imported)
I'm fucking a baller, we courted
I'm making it clap, he record it (Damn)
And he keep on making them noises (Yeah)
Damn, fuck, shitâ¦ Ooh (Fuck, oh)

Drop me a pin where you at
I'm gonna come round like a lac (Like a lac)
I get in my yac on that yac

He doggin' it out, make it fat
He tell me "Girl, you the best"
But I already know what I am

Getting high like a fire (High like a fire)
Bitch, I pull up on ya boo (Bitch, I pull up on ya boo)

Got him drinking out the fire (Yeah)
He know I'm dropping that game
But I'm not gone tell him a lie

Drank, drank, I been drankin'

I know you tired of me playin'
Call you back to back, call you back
'Til you call me, call me back baby
I know it's late, you been waiting
My cognac kisses make you crazy
These other bitches can't fade me

Give me hug, it feel good to me
Hold me up, you too good to me
Cut 'em off, I know you would for me

He know I only agree
When I'm getting full of the drink

Went Courvoisier crazy
Got him thinking he my baby
