Lyrics:


This could be my last confession
This could be my last defense
I wish that we could learn our lesson
I wish that we could make amends and turn the page

As far as I remember
It was a thing to forgive and forget
You said that you would let go
But I guess you didnât mean what you said
Now itâs time to surrender
Because I donât want to live with regret
And nothing lasts forever
As far as I remember

This could be a new beginning
Or this could be a brutal end
I wish that we could stop pretending
I wish that we could make amends and turn the page

As far as I remember
It was a thing to forgive and forget
You said that you would let go
But I guess you didnât mean what you said
Now itâs time to surrender
Because I donât want to live with regret
And nothing lasts forever
As far as I remember

I rather die on my feet
Than live my life on my knees
Iâd rather die on my feet
Than live my life on my knees
Iâd rather die on my feet
Than live my life on my knees

As far as I remember
It was a thing to forgive and forget
You said that you would let go
But I guess you didnât mean what you said
Now itâs time to surrender
Because I donât want to live with regret
And nothing lasts forever
As far as I remember

I rather die on my feet
Than live my life on my knees
Iâd rather die on my feet
Than live my life on my knees
Iâd rather die on my feet
Than live my life on my knees
(As far as I remember)

I rather die on my feet
Than live my life on my knees
Iâd rather die on my feet
Than live my life on my knees
(As far as I remember)
Iâd rather die on my feet
Than live my life on my knees
