Lyrics:


Who's sorry? I'm not sorry (Who's sorry? I'm not sorry)
Who's sorry? I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)

You twist & you turn
You got the urge to burn
The government should really be the least of your concern
The privilege to do is what you earn
To be yourself & free yourself is what I've come to learn
No more political dreams or elusive schemes
A reefer-lution outbreak is what it seems
Gimme consent, yes to vape or steam
Burn to redeem

I've been playing too hard for way too long
Burning the candle at both ends & now it's gone
I feel broken
Busted-open
I thought I was a baller but my body has spoken
No joke, we go for the glory
But I'll probably have another 'fore I finish this story
And one more inside of me
Then both my body & my mind, don't need apologies

Well, who's sorry? I'm not sorry (Who's sorry? I'm not sorry)
Who's sorry? I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)

I guess It's time to take a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
Slow down & take-a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)

I've been working overtime for way too long
I gave it everything I had till all emotion was gone
And now I'm hoping to move along
Away from any voice that makes me think I am wrong
I need focus
No hocus pocus
I'm gonna throw my freaking phone in the ocean

Who's sorry? I'm not sorry (Who's sorry? I'm not sorry)
Who's sorry? I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)

Because it's time to take a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
Lay down & take-a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
It's time to take a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
4: 20 is the time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)

Out of respect-a
I request-a
That we take a little time to siesta
Save the drama
For your mama
'Cause this ain't Broadway
I'll remind ya
I require
Time to re-stoke proverbial fire
And retire
A la playa
Because life is a beach anyway

I'm taking it easy (Taking it easy)
I'm taking it slow (Taking it slow)
You bet I'm taking it easy (Taking it easy)
I'm taking it slow

Tick a tick a tock a dis is no time to rock
Tick a tick a tock a this a must Spliff-a-clock
Excuse me while I light mi likkle ting upon the dock
Time fi mi self ah man a mi nuh need nuh flock
Undivided & provided by mi brethren 'round the block
The sky-grade a my-grade, it loud like a glock
Sticky like a sitten whey dem have inna the stock
Time to meditate a mi seh time to get knock

Are you medicated & the answer is yes
Too bless to be stressed & even when mi penny less
Mi nuh worry none at all a chaos mi nuh digest
Light another one & circumnavigate the stress
Sorry everybody but mi haffi confess
Product of the ghetto now mi living in the west
Mi nuh hesitate when mi burning the best
Mi nuh hesitate when mi burning the best

It's time to take a time
Time, time, time, to take a time out (Time out)
Slow down & take a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
Take a time
Time, time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
Slow down & take a time
Time, time, time to take a time out
(Mi nuh hesitate when mi burning the best)
(Mi nuh hesitate when mi burning the best)
