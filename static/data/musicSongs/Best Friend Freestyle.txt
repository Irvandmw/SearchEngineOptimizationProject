Lyrics:


Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, hey, yeah, hey

With no effort I'm blessin' these niggas (Achoo)
Stayin' 2 steps ahead of these niggas
I'm the truth and it's evident, nigga
You actin' like you want the recipe, listen
I promise I'm somethin' you'll never be
Local hoes fucking me like a celebrity
All my shows jumpin' like they got a check for me
That shit ain't nothing, you ain't seen the best of me
You know they music not fucking with mine
I got my pistol, that's how I get inside
I got a bitch that's so muhfuckin' fine
My dick get hard when I look in her eyes
Get rich or die before I'm 25
Dime more than 5, I charge you 25
Wherever I go I pull up with that stick
You never know, might pull up with your bitch, yeah
I made them mad, they don't like when a young nigga come around
And fuck everybody who gave me the run around
I don't want no more advice, I'm just livin' my life
I'ma take consequences and wear 'em like stripes
If I make a mistake, I don't care, it's alright
I'ma just brush off my shoulders like nobody knows
The plug said he fuck with my music, he told me keep going
I just hung up on my bitch when she told me she love me
Fronted a pack to my nigga and told him get money
I bring the food to the table, break bread with the family
#1 rule, don't put no one ahead of the family
They keep on calling my number, I'm comin', I'm comin'
You just a middleman, you need to keep it 100
Finessin' your trap and hop out with a bag
5 pounds of OG, the car don't got gas
Don't got ID in the whip, got bad tags
I will not stop until I love 'em so
Fuck around break down on side of the road
I was true to the game before I had a 9
I'm no longer nobody, find me on Google
Yeah, that's my lil' brother, that's also my shooter
We grew up together like Future and Scooter
Get money together like Puffy and Biggie
Feel like it's my duty to deliver music
The shit that I be hearing is literally silly to me
I'm consistently makin' this magic
I'm way above average, ahead of the pact
I grew up in Charlotte, put it on my back
Don't get me started, how you wanna act, yeah
