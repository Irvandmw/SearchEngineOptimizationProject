Lyrics:


Youâre no good for me
Baby youâre no good for me
Youâre no good for me
But baby I want you, I want

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now low down and gritty
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses
Cause we gonna take a ride
Iâm not gonna listen to what the past says
Iâve been waiting up all night

Take another drag turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says heâs gonna teach me just what fast is
Say itâs gonna be alright

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now low down and gritty
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Letâs take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what weâre here for
Saved too many times

Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now low down and gritty
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Youâre no good for me
Baby youâre no good for me
Youâre no good for me
But baby I want you, I want you

Youâre no good for me
Baby youâre no good for me
Youâre no good for me
But baby I want you, I want you, I want you

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Baby stoppinâ at seven eleven
There in his white Pontiac heaven
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now low down and gritty
Do you think weâll be in love forever?
Do you think weâll be in love?

Youâre no good for me
Baby youâre no good for me
Youâre no good for me
But baby I want you, I want

Youâre no good for me
Baby youâre no good for me
Youâre no good for me
But baby I want you, I want

Youâre no good for me
Baby youâre no good for me
Youâre no good for me
But baby I want you, I want
