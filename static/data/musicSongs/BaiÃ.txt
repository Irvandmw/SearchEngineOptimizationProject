Lyrics:


Oh BaiÃ¡... when twilight is deep in the sky... BaiÃ¡ 
Someone that I long to see, keeps haunting my memory 
An' so the loneliness deep in my heart calls to you, calls to you! 
(Oh BaiÃ¡...) Oh BaiÃ¡...  

(I live in the memory of many dreams ago,  
when the stars were bright and you were mine alone... 
My love for you can not die, though the oceans run dry 
or heaven's call from the sky, now you're gone!)  

BaiÃ¡... can't you hear my lonely call?...  

Morea... make my life complete again! 
How I pray for the day when I'll see you smile 
an' my heart will beat again! 

Oh BaiÃ¡... when twilight is deep in the sky... BaiÃ¡ 
Someone that I long to see, keeps haunting my memory 
An' so the loneliness deep in my heart calls to you, calls to you! 
(Oh BaiÃ¡...) Oh BaiÃ¡... (Oh BaiÃ¡...)
