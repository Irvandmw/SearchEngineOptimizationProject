Lyrics:


You know everybody been waiting on that Baby, man
I mean, it like ever since Baby on Baby dropped, man, like
(Ever since Baby on Baby dropped) You know
Ain't nobody drop shit (Oh, Lord, Jetson made another one)
(Let's go)

(Hah)
I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
I flew past a whip with that blunt in my mouth
While she swerving, that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her across the country
I'll finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a millie, I did it legitly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (Hot)

Oh, you asking for pictures with niggas? (What)
What's yo name? Get the fuck out the spot nigga (Get the fuck)
Tryna figure which deal I'ma take
I woke up, couple mill' on my plate (Let's eat)
I'm investing in real in the state
I just went gave my mama a hundred (A hundred)
Probably won't hear me open my mouth
'Less you hear me talking 'bout finding some money (Let's go)
As soon as I found it, I flipped that (Flip)
I'm a little bit different, they get it (They dig)
Know I'm stiff on a bitch and she dig it
Tryna find out why Baby ain't all in her mentions
No, she ain't get no DM from me (Bitch)
This rich nigga dick, it ain't free
She be throwing that ass, yeah, she good at it
Turn around when we fuck, make her look at it

(She like, hah)
I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
I flew past a whip with that blunt in my mouth
While she swerving, that whip had a cop in it (Okay, woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her across the country
I'll finish the show and I hop in it (Yeah)
I got me a millie, I did it legitly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (Let's go, hot)

I'm unorthodox than a muhfucka'
Aye, when you gone switch the flow? I thought you'd never ask
You niggas ain't fucking with me and ain't 'bout what the fuck
They be rapping 'bout with they lil' scary ass
But to each his own nigga
If you like it, I love it, no biggie (No big)
That boy say he get money, oh, really?
How much they just cut you a check for? A millie
I'm going back to Cali like Biggie (Go back)
'Bout to go get a pound just to smoke (I smoke)
They told me to come work on my album
I'm tryna go find out the price on a boat (Okay)
My lil' bitch act like Megan Thee Stallion
She ghetto and nasty, she driving the boat (Drive the boat)
All this shit that they making be boring
Give me something to bop while I ride with the pole
Here you go

(Huh, okay, okay, hah)
I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
I flew past a whip with that blunt in my mouth
While she swerving, that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her across the country
I'll finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a millie, I did it legitly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (I'm hot)

Aight, this shit for like, you know
The sophisticated ratchet hoe, you know
The ones that go to work by day then
You know, dance in the mirror by night

(Hah)
I needed some shit with some bop in it (Okay, let's go)
I flew past a whip with that blunt in my mouth
While she swerving, that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her across the country
I'll finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a millie, I did it legitly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (I'm hot)

Oh, you asking for pictures with niggas?
What's yo name? Get the fuck out the spot, nigga (Get the fuck)
Tryna figure which deal I'ma take
I woke up, couple mill on my plate
