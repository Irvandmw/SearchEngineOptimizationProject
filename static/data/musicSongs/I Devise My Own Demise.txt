Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I can't control everything
And I can't forget just what I've seen
These memories take me away
To a better place than I am today
I devise my own demise
Here's to life-the life I'm losing
It is time to say hello goodbye (hello goodbye)
To fade away, fade away alone (motherfuck it, goodbye!)
I just want you to take, take me back home
To a better place that I've never known
That I've never known
I can't control everything (death is the only way out!)
And I can't forget just what I've seen (death is the only way out!)
These memories take me away
To a better place that I am today
Than I am today
...this life I'm losing (this life I'm losing)
I devise my...own demise
