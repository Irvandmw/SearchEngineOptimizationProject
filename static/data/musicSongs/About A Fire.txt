Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Something 'bout a fire that burns in your soul
Saw it in your eyes and I couldn't let it go
I hesitate 'cause I know wrong from right
It took me by surprise it wouldn't leave without a fight
Something 'bout a fire that burns in your soul

A little slight of hand that melts away your mind
With every grain of sand you never know what you might find
Traces of film memories not your own
It's on display in a wonderland picture show
Something 'bout a fire that burns in your soul

I hesitate 'cause I know wrong from right
But it took me by surprise it wouldn't leave without a fight
Something 'bout a fire that burns in your soul
Something 'bout a fire that I won't let go
Something 'bout a fire that burns in your soul
