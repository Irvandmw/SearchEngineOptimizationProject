Lyrics:


You saw what others couldn't see
And loved the lonely part of me
Now I have everything, now I have everything
I know I used to be so strong
I never thought I could be alone
Now I have everything, now I have everything

I have your understanding
Your love is all I need
I was so far down and then you touched me
My aching soul was freed

You saw what I was hiding, you didn't turn away
You were there to stay
You were there to stay

You never cared what people said
You saw me with your heart instead
Now I have everything, now I have everything

You never cared what people said
You saw me with your heart instead
Now I have everything, now I have everything
With all the love you give
Now I have everything
