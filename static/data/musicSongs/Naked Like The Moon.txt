Lyrics:


I catch a word of the universal rhyme
In the summertimes in the summertimes
The river flows and I wonder where it goes
Only heaven knows only heaven knows

Inpatient with the human race
Still Nature shows a friendly face
And I believe in paradise on Earth

But then tonight I had this dream
So horrible I had to scream
I saw the Earth naked like the Moon
Naked like the Moon

[Piano]

Inpatient with the human race
Still Nature shows a friendly face
And I believe in paradise on Earth

But when I saw the News today
So horrible I had to pray
Don't leave the Earth naked like the Moon
Naked like the Moon
