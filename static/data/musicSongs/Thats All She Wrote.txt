Lyrics:


Hello mister mailman, thank you for the letter
It's from my baby far away
But wait mister mailman, this couldn't be my letter
Baby never writes this way

She didn't say I love you or I'm thinking of you
She didn't say sincerely or I miss you dearly
At the end was just goodbye my friend
Just a note
That's all she wrote

But look mister mailman, look at the writing,
There could be no mistake
I just didn't think the hand that wrote such sweet things
Would make my poor heart break

She didn't say I love you or I'm thinking of you
She didn't say sincerely or I miss you dearly
At the end was just goodbye my friend
Just a note
That's all she wrote

So please mister mailman, take away the letter
It's just a sad memory
You know mister mailman
The sooner I forget her
The better off I'll be

She didn't say I love you or I'm thinking of you
She didn't say sincerely or I miss you dearly
At the end was just goodbye my friend
Just a note
That's all she wrote
That's all she wrote
That's all she wrote
