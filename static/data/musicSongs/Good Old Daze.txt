Lyrics:


Is it Flashback Friday again?
Actually, I can't remember when
Or where the heck I am
But I'm doing the best I can
It's been a hazy afternoon
Lackadaisically playing tunes
The kind that lift and shift my mood
To an attitude of gratitude
Today feels like a classic
Love your life as you imagined
Maybe nothing special happened
But every moment's made of magic

Because it feels like the good old daze are happening right now
Feels like the good old, the good old, the good old, the good old, the good old daze
It feels like the good old times are happening right now

I don't need no great escape
Every moment's what we make
I'm gonna take my time and try on a few paths my life can take
Every breakdown is a blessing
Every love's learning me lessons
Life will always keep me guessing
Well, I can say without a question

That it feels like the good old daze are happening right now
Feels like the good old, the good old, the good old, the good old, the good old daze
It feels like the good old times are happening right now
It feels like the good old daze

It feels like the good old daze are happening
Feels just like them good old daze

I'm loving the vibe and the energy
In line with everyone and everything
I'm feeling this way
'Cause back in the day
There was a little kid dreaming we'd be here singing

We all have a melody
And lots of good reasons to celebrate
Lots of good love, lot's of good life
Oh yeah, we're doing it right

'Cause you know that it feels like the good old daze are happening right now
Feels like the good old, the good old, the good old, the good old, the good old daze
It feels like the good old times are happening right now
It feels like the good old daze

It feels like the good old daze are happening
Feels just like them good old daze
Yes it does
Well, it feels like there's still a few years to go
It's real, these are the good old daze, yeah

Is it Flashback Friday again?
Actually, I can't remember when
Or where the heck I am
But I'm doing the best I can
