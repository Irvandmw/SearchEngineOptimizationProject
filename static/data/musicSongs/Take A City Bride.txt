Lyrics:


I got a house on stilts and a five dollar bill
Sitting on the banks of a muddy, muddy bayou
That's a lot better than the streets of crowded cars
Pawnshops, friendly neighborhood bars

But your mom and your papa won't let me come a courtin'
Says I can't make a good livin' for the child
But the fish bite good and the crawfish are plenty
Gonna make a lot of money when I take a city bride

I got a pain, can't run, and your papa's got a big dog
Snappin' at my heels, get away you mangey hound
But the lights still burnin' and the ladders by the window
I take a chance, gonna make another round

But your mom and your papa won't let me come a courtin'
Says I can't make a good livin' for the child
But the fish bite good and the crawfish are plenty
Gonna make a lot of money when I take a city bride
