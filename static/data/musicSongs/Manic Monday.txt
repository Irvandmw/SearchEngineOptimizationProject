Lyrics:


Six o'clock already, I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissing Valentino by a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late 'cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days when you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday (Ohh, ohh)
I wish it was Sunday (Ohh, ohh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ohh, ohh)
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train, got to be to work by nine
If I had an aeroplane, I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train, but the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday (Ohh, ohh)
I wish it was Sunday (Ohh, ohh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ohh, ohh)
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

All of the nights, why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?
(Last night we got down)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down (Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh)
But when she tells me in her bedroom voice
"Come on, honey, let's go make some noise" (I can't resist)
Time, it goes so fast (When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday (Ohh, ohh)
I wish it was Sunday (Ohh, ohh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ohh, ohh)
It's just another manic Monday
