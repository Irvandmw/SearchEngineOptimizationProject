Lyrics:


Who's a beard that's long and white
Santa's got a beard that's long and white
Who comes round on a special night
Santa comes round on a special night

Special night, beard that's white

Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus

Who wears boots and a suit of red
Santa wears boots and a suit of red
Who wears a long cap on his head
Santa wears a long cap on his head

Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white

Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus

Who's got a big, red cherry nose
Santa's got a big, red cherry nose
Who laughs this way, "ho, ho, ho"
Santa laughs this way, "ho, ho, ho"

"Ho, ho, ho", cherry nose
Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white

Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus

Who very soon will come our way?
Santa very soon will come our way
Hey, little reindeer, pull his sleigh
Santa's little reindeer, pull his sleigh

Bring your sleigh, come our way
"Ho, ho, ho", cherry nose
Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white

Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus

When's Santa coming?
Christmas Eve!

Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen

Bring your sleigh, come our way
"Ho, ho, ho", cherry nose
Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white

Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus
Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus

(Don't forget Rudolph! Ha-ha!)
