Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Because you're mine the brightest star I see
Looks down my love and envies me
Because you're mine
Because you're mine

Because you're mine the breeze that hurries by
Becomes a melody and why
Because you're mine
Because you're mine

I only know for as long as I may live
I'll only live for the kiss you alone may give me
And when we kiss
That isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear
And its applause because you're mine

And when we kiss
That isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear
And its applause
Because you're mine
