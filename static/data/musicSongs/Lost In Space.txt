Lyrics:


As the world goes round, round, round,
Let the beat go down down down
Can we stay up all night,
Cause we can sleep all day,
Everybody can come out to play,
Let me hear ya say yeah yeah yeah.

How did we get here,
It feels like I'm floatin' off the ground,
Love is the only place,
I'm getting scared of looking down,
Let's go, aah aah.
I get so hot that I don't feel anything baby,
Aah aah,
And I get this spot, but I got you by my side,
Aah aah
It's about to get crazy, get crazy with me
Hold on time...

[Chorus:]
As the world goes round, round, round, round
Let the beat go down down down down
Can we stay up all night,
Cause we can sleep all day,
Everybody can come out to play,
Let me hear ya say yeah yeah yeah.
We get lost in space,
We don't need nobody, to get lost in space,
Show me how you rock it baby,
Lost in space, we don't need nobody,
To get lost in space,
Lost lost in space.

Feels like I'm crushin',
I crash slowly into you,
I love the attraction
I'm loving everything you do,

Aah aah.
I get so hot that I don't feel anything baby,
Aah aah,
And I get this spot, but I got you by my side,
Aah aah
It's about to get crazy, get crazy with me
Hold on time.

[Chorus:]
As the world goes round, round, round, round
Let the beat go down down down down
Can we stay up all night,
Cause we can sleep all day,
Everybody can come out to play,
Let me hear ya say yeah yeah yeah.
We get lost in space,
We don't need rock it, to get lost in space,
Show me how you rock it baby,
Lost in space, we don't need nobody,
To get lost in space,
Lost lost in space.

[x2:]
We don't need nobody, to get lost in space,
Show me how you rock it baby,
Baby lost in space
We don't need rock it, to get lost in space,
Lost lost in space,
Lost lost in space,

[Chorus:]
As the world goes round, round, round, round
Let the beat go down down down down
Can we stay up all night,
Cause we can sleep all day,
Everybody can come out to play,
Let me hear ya say yeah yeah yeah.
We get lost in space,
We don't need rock it, to get lost in space,
Show me how you rock it baby,
Lost in space, we don't need nobody,
To get lost in space,
Lost lost in space.
