Lyrics:


With pen in hand
You sign your name
Today at five
I might be on that train
And you'll be free
And I will be alone (alone)
Alone (alone)

If you think we can't find
The love we once knew
If you think that I can't make
It all up to you
Then I'll be gone
And you'll be on your own (your own)
On your own (your own)

And this is what I wanna know
Can you take good care of the children
Can you take them to school everyday (every every every)
Can you teach them how
To catch the fish and keep all of the bullies away
Can you keep them away

And tonight as you lay
In your lonely lonely bed
And you try to tell me that when you look at the pillow
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire (fire)
Would you have no desire (have no desire)
To kiss me (kiss me)
To kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss me

And if you can't forget
Those good times we had
If you think that the good
The good outweighs the bad
Then sign your name
And I tell you what
I'll be on my way (my way)
My way (my way)

I'll be on my way (my way)
Yeah, I'll be on my way baby (my way)
You know I'm the one, you gonna want me back
My way (sign)
My way (sign)
You know you love me (my way)
(Sign) and you know that I need somebody to love
(Sign) baby don't sign
(My way) (sign) baby don't sign
(My way) (sign) baby (my way) (sign)
(My way) (sign) baby don't sign, don't sign
