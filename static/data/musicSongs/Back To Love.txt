Lyrics:


I, I know I might let you down
Every twice in a while and I apologize
I get emotional sometimes, ha

But I'll keep running with my best foot forward
'Cause the race to love is never over
I wanna be better for ya
You made me genuinely better

You opened my heart, oh
You got me back to love
Back to love
Let's get back to love

I know I lost it, now I wanna get it back
You know I wanna get it back
There's a light on the path
And now I found it, here with you is where it's at
Now I'm never looking back
No, I'm never going back

I, I might get lost in the clouds
Every once in a while but I found a way out, huh
I get stronger with time, ooh

You opened my heart, oh (Oh)
You got me back to love (Oh, woah)
(That's where I'm meant to be, that's where I'm meant to be)
Ooh, back to love
(Right where we're meant to be, right where we're meant to be)
Can we get back to love?
(Can we get back? Can we get back?)
To how we used to be

I know I lost it and I wanna get it back
Now I wanna get it back
There's a light on the path
And now I found it, here with you is where it's at
Now I'm never looking back
No, I'm never going back

Had a good girl but I ain't treat her right
I was up in her head with bullshit every night
Took a little time, but now I got it right
You opened my eyes up to see the light

But I'll keep running with my best foot forward
'Cause the race to love is never over
I wanna be better for ya
You made me genuinely better

You opened my heart, oh
You got me back to love
(That's where I'm meant to be, that's where I'm meant to be)
Back to love
(Right where we're meant to be, right where we're meant to be)
Let's get back to love
(Can we get back? Can we get back?)

Can we get back to love?
Back to love
Can we get back to love?
Back to love

I know I lost it, now I wanna get it back
Now I wanna get it back
There's a light on the path
And now I found it, here with you is where it's at
Now I'm never looking back
No, I'm never going back
