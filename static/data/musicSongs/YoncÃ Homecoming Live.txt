Lyrics:


See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every girl in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how it's lookin' babe

Drop the bass mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up', I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
The man ain't never seen a booty like this
So why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash I just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
