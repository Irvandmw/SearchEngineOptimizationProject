Lyrics:


Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that donât offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if theyâre half as stubborn as me
Theyâll just keep on shining bright
I ainât ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ainât strong
Iâll just move on
And leave this in my past

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Iâll act today
Until you find somebody new
So Iâve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Canât call it love if you ainât in it

Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still donât know
Oh and it troubles me so

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Iâll feel today
I see you found somebody new
And Iâve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Canât call it love if you ainât in it

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Iâll feel today
I see you found somebody new
So Iâve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Canât call it love if you ainât in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile
