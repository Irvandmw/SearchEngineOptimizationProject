Lyrics:


How are ya' fixed for moonlight?
How are ya' fixed for stars?
How are ya' fixed for kissin'?
While we listen to soft guitars?

How are ya' fixed for someone
To watch the rain with?
To stroll down the lane with
For someone to just go a little insane with?

How are ya' fixed for memories?
Memories that shine so bright?
If we let fancy take us
We could make us a few tonight

How are ya' fixed for someone
Who'll fit your arms like a glove?
Hey, tell me, baby
How are ya' fixed for love?

How are ya' fixed for kissin'
While we dig those wild guitars?
How are ya' fixed for someone
To sit and tan with? To worry and plan with?
For someone to dine right from out of a can with?

How are ya fixed for memories
Memories that glow so bright?
Oh, if we let cupid rock us
We could knock us a few tonight

How are ya' fixed
For someone who'll fit your arms like a glove?
Hey, tell me, baby how are ya' fixed for
Tell me baby, how are ya' fixed for
Tell me, baby, how are ya' fixed for love?
