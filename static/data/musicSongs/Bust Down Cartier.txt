Ooh, oooh
Yeah
Mosey-Mosey you made this?

She a bad bitch, I gotta have it (Gotta have it)
She's just a date, got a brand new bust down Patek (Bust down)
Bust down cartier, yeah (Ooh)
Getting bands today (Bands)
Fly out on a jet, just for me to get away
She a bad bitch, I gotta have it (Gotta have it)
She's just a date, got a brand new bust down Patek (Bust down)
Bust down cartier, yeah (Bust)
Getting bands today (Bands)
Fly out on a jet, just for me to get away

Seat belt
That bitch, yeah, she ridin' with no seat belt (Lil bitch)
Need help, popping tags with no detail
Molly, still didn't change, I still pop xans
But I said I don't need them, uh-uh

Pop a bean, have her over here in the outer space
Ridin' with my niggas, while we shootin' on your lane
For my whole city, I be winning to get a K
Youngest nigga they ever see to fly away (Fly away)

She a bad bitch, I gotta have it (Gotta have it)
She's just a date, got a brand new bust down Patek (Bust down)
Bust down cartier, yeah (Ooh)
Getting bands today (Bands)
Fly out on a jet, just for me to get away
She a bad bitch, I gotta have it (Gotta have it)
She's just a date, got a brand new bust down Patek (Bust down)
Bust down cartier, yeah (Bust)
Getting bands today (Bands)
Fly out on a jet, just for me to get away

Iced out, it ain't heavy (Gang, gang)
Me and my niggas shootin', it's a heavy, yeah
One and two, on your girl, it's heavy, yeah (Brr)
Got some stars on the roof, bitches love it, has them crazy
Gucci on my waist, burberry headband
Bust him on the face, yeah, we on the check, man
And I'm drippin all this water, feel like a snow-man
And I'm off of some Wok, cause you're still a broke man (Lil' bitch)

She a bad bitch, I gotta have it (Gotta have it)
She's just a date, got a brand new bust down Patek (Bust down)
Bust down cartier, yeah (Ooh)
Getting bands today (Bands)
Fly out on a jet, just for me to get away
She a bad bitch, I gotta have it (Gotta have it)
She's just a date, got a brand new bust down Patek (Bust down)
Bust down cartier, yeah (Bust)
Getting bands today (Bands)
Fly out on a jet, just for me to get away

Now I'm heavy
