Lyrics:


Where are you my guiding star
Did you just vaish from sight
A comet passing in flight
How could you go when you must know
How precious and how dear to me you are
I need you my guiding star
Without you shining for me
I have no reason to be
So through the night love
I'll search for your light
Where are you where are you
My guiding star
