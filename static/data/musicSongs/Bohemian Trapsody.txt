Every night
I grab a little piece of Earth and make it ignite
I'm a satellite
Drifting through your nova at the speed of light
Every night
I grab a little piece of Earth and make it ignite
I'm a satellite
Drifting through your nova at the speed of light

I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know
I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know
Yes, I said, Yes, I said, Yes, I said, Yes, I should know, oh

And when I fall for you
That's when I break down my wall for you
Promise that I'd risk it all for you
Promise to reveal my all for you
That's when I fall for you
That's when I break down my wall for you
Promise that I'd risk it all for you
Promise to reveal my all for you

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Yeah
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Yeah

Every night
I grab a little piece of Earth and make it ignite
I'm a satellite
Drifting through your nova at the speed of light

I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know
I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know
Yes, I said, Yes, I said, Yes, I said, Yes, I should know, oh

And when I fall for you
That's when I break down my wall for you
Promise that I'd risk it all for you
Promise to reveal my all for you
And when I fall for you
That's when I break down my wall for you
Promise that I'd risk it all for you
Promise to reveal my all for you

And when I fall for you
That's when I break down my wall for you
Promise that I'd risk it all for you
Promise to reveal my all for you
And when I fall for you
That's when I break down my wall for you
Promise that I'd risk it all for you
Promise to reveal my all for you

And when I fall (Fall for you)
And when I fall (Fall for you)
Fall for you
Fall for you, yeah
Fall

Hold up, pour up
Break it down and we roll up, shown up
Break it down for me, shawty
Break it down for me
Break it down for
Hold up, pour up
Break it down and we roll up, shown up
Break it down for me, shawty
Break it down for me
Break it down for

Elevated, feeling elevated, took a hit of weed and shit escalated
Feeling innovative, I'ma integrate it, yeah, that's why I made it
Keep it classic, yo' shit is dated
We poppin', you ain't poppin', we ain't related, never hesitated
Pass the weed like a legislator, likeâlike, goddamn
