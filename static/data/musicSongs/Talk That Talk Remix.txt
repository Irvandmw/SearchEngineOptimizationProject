[Rick Ross]
Rozay, RiRi wassup?

[Rihanna]
Talk that talk to me, yeah
Talk that talk to me, yeah

[Rick Ross]
I hop out the BM, I park right next to young Hov
Took a page out the bible, Iâm rocking all yellow gold
Face to face with my rivals these haters praying I fold
All I sold âem was candy, I need a hammers?
Took the doors off the jeep
Now we just ride slow
New Air Yeezyâs on my feet
I got âem hanging out the door
Itâs double M G
Rihanna grinding it slow
We dominate the streets
Thats cause we grinding the most
Ya know?

[Rihanna - Hook]
One and two and a three and four
Come on let me know if you want some more
You know what I like, now get right
Boy talk that talk to me all night
Yeah boy I like it yeah boy I like it
Love it when you talk that talk to me yeah
Yeah that talk to me yeah
Love it when you talk that talk to me, yeah

[Rihanna]
Say what you want, say you want you like
Say you want me to do and I got you
Tell me how to love you, tell me how to hold you

Iâmma get it right on the first try for you
Cause you ainât never had a woman like me, yeah
And you will never have another like me, yeah
Noooooo
So Iâma give it to you baby

[Hook]

[Jay-Z]
I be trying to chill, bitches wanna fuck me
Every little city I go, fuck me
Shawty mustâve heard, got the word, I move that D
Had it by a bladder, she like âoh I gotta peeâ
Ran into a Rothko in my restroom
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
God I have the ticket for a walk through
Everything I do is big
I talk big money, I talk big homes
I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through the phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
Iâm Flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefa
Sex on the beach, left love speechless
They say that money talk, tell these other niggas speak up
Whatâs up

[Hook]

[Bridge]
What you saying now, give it to me baby
I want it all night, give it to me baby
What you saying now, give it to me baby
Give it to me baby, give it to me baby

What you saying now, give it to me baby
I want it all night, give it to me baby
What you saying now, give it to me baby
Give it to me baby, give it to me baby

[Hook]

Talk that talk to me, yeah
Talk that talk to me, yeah
