Lyrics:


Baby, Iâm tryinâ to make some sense
Of all we shouldâve learned from experience
We win, we lose, we conquer and we fail
One part serious, do or die
Another part crush in junior high
Iâm chasing my emotions like a tail
I can still move my fingers
But I canât seem to let go

The cold winds are blowing, I should be goinâ
Iâm in over my head
Without even blinkinâ, youâve got me thinkinâ
I would be better off dead
Yeahâ Iâm in over my head

You made me weak, I made you laugh
Driving through the rain in a yellow cab
The taste of your kiss is with me even now
But this thing weâve got goes by different names
Never two days in a row the same
I wanna stop feelinâ this, but donât know how

I see my legs and theyâre moving
But I just canât walk away

[Chorus]

Iâll say goodbye, but talk is cheap
I count the memories in my sleep
Iâve had enough, but I want more

Makinâ me weak, makinâ you laugh
Driving through the rain in that yellow cab
Baby, your kiss is with me even now

[Chorus]
