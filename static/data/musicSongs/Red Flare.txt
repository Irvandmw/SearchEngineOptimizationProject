Lyrics:


If the stars, make the skies so bright
Then where is my moon?
In the forest, with the trees so high
There lies a truth
In a perfect world, tears would mean more than just crying
If a desert could bring a rose to life, my rains coming soon

I think I deserve the pain of a lovers heart
I know there's someone out there who needs me to light up their dark

I'm gonna fire it off
Blow it away
Make room in the sky
For sparks to ignite
My red flare is on
There it will stay
In hopes of one day, that you'll come and find me
Come find me

Hear the whispers of the angels so loud
Are you listening?
See the smoke in the air, I won't let this flare burn out
It'll help you find me

I think I deserve the pain of a lover's heart
I know there's someone out there who needs me to light up their dark

I'm gonna fire it off
Blow it away
Make room in the sky
For sparks to ignite
My red flare is on
There it will stay
In hopes of one day, that you'll come and...

Follow the signals pointing towards me
Don't lose your focus keep on going
You're getting warmer, warmer, so much closer
Come let me light up your dark

I'm gonna fire it off
Blow it away
Make room in the sky
My red flare is on
There it will stay
In hopes of one day
I'm gonna fire it off
Blow it away
Make room in the sky
For sparks to ignite
My red flare is on
There it will stay
In hopes of one day, that you'll come and find me

Come find me
Hope that you will find me
Come find me, oh
