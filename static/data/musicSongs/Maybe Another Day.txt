Lyrics:


I haven't much I could give you in return 
If you'd only see my point of view.
I don't need you.
I don't need you.
I don't need you.
I don't need you.
I don't need you.
If you would return, I don't know what I would say
But if you forgot it would be okay.
Maybe another day.
Maybe another day.
Maybe another day.
Maybe another day.
Maybe another day.
??
I'm telling you I can't be true??
I don't need you.
I don't need you.
I don't need you.
I don't need you.
I don't need you.
I try to hide but still you come my way.
I can't ?? stay
Maybe another day.
Maybe another day.
Maybe another day.
Maybe another day.
Maybe another day.
