Lyrics:


Turn me up
Jamz turn me up

I know you heard of the boogie man
I am that nigga he woulda been
Hoodie on like I'm the reaper though
17 deep in the sprinter van
I heard they tryna get equal though
I would not let them get even man
She told me she trying to get into it
But I know these bitches be sneaky man
Murder she wrote murder all she wrote
I can go Boogie or artist flow
I probably got every car you drove
I probably fucked every broad you know
Bitches think I'm a target, no
Want me to take you to Bonnies, no
Run it up see how far we go
Double up but be cautious though
I know they hate seeing me in first class
I'm a young nigga wearing her mess
I came up from the big x
And Came home to a big bag
Imma big boss and you big mad
Fuck around and die by my respect
I got blood all over my christans
From all my oppositions
Fuck all my oppositions
Like every pair damn loubs now I got blisters
And all of my day ones got caught up in the system
If she don't want me, I fuck with her sister
I'm so grimy when it comes to these bitches
I hit her then end up going missing
I'm up now there ain't no more hard feelings
Its cool I just put her in the friendzy
I just had to put her in the frenzy
I swear they don't wanna see me happy
They just wanna see me in my feelings
Used to me a little nappy nigga now I'm nappy with a couple million
On the come up they was laughing at me
Now they fucking with me cause I'm winning
Now they say I'm acting different
This shit change you when you really in it
These days I can't come complain
Still get laid I swear
I used to not get paid
I'm back to my old ways
Tech hoodie on
No chains
First pair of new balmains
Had me feeling like Kurt Cobain
I embarrassed all my fly things
On the floor seats at the ball game
I got mad saint Lauren shit
I told em' nigga personally call me
Gotta stab bitch niggas in the streets I ain't even gotta call B
They be mad hoes after shows they following me to the lobby
Imma asshole when they come to that
I don't want you bitches to love me
But that's just cause I get it
Been in my bag for a minute
I just flow with it
They all in my business, but
They just do not get it
Blood on my shoes I'm sinning, yeah
New E.R.D getting yeah
A lot of niggas dress just like me
But its alright I already did it, yeah
Niggas wanna rap just like me
But its okay I already did it, yeah
Aliante got me icy
W's up I'm winning
W's up I'm winning
And I told her that I loved her but I didn't care
And if I expose her
It's because told my business, yeah
I'm kinda like povi in a business man
I'm a business man
I miss my nigga V12 and Montana man
I remember back when we was younger
I wish you was with me sitting in this Benz
Now when we talk the convos being lamgos cause you in affairs
Got a little heart, getting used to all these millions
I keep a minimum wage
Gotta little heart talking to you
Through a phone
Knowing I can't see your face
Nigga with a wire
Started fucking with you nigga
What the fuck did you say
Told you, you ain't gotta sell grills
No more nigga, but you did anyway
I wish they give you bell
You woulda been with me today
Real shit just 3 on my call
