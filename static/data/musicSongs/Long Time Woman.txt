Artist: Nancy Sinatra Lyrics
Song Name: Long Time Woman
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Sorrow is a long time woman
Resting on a nowdays mind
When her vision haunts your mornings
Tears will not be far behind

In the time that grows between you
You may try a thousand times
But you will not erase her image
With all your one night valentines

One sad question
Never leaves your mind:
"Could we have made it
If we'd tried just one more time?"

After of the one more chances
Break against the walls of change
Love is gone but still you tremble
When somebody speaks her name

Love may come again to find you
So much younger than you thought you were
Oh but never will your long time woman
Leave the place you've made for her

Never will this long time woman
Leave the place you've made for her
