Lyrics:


My baby cried,all night long
My baby cried all night long

He saw me dancing with a boy named Joe
A hug and then a kiss and with the lights down low

And my baby cried all night long
My baby cried all night long
My baby cried all night long

He saw me messin with a boy named Lu
And baby can't do what Lu can do

And my baby cried all night long

Last night I cried all night long
Last night I cried all night long

I saw my baby out on the town
Doing all the things I've done
And made brought me down
And then I cried all night long
Yeah,last night I cried all night long.

And tomorrow this story is that you shouldn't become a messing, when you shouldn't be messin.
Were you end up crying, all night long?
And that's where I am look: Crying all night long...
