Lyrics:


Every Friday night I call your butt up on the phone
A deeper voice answers and says you're not at home
Now if you think that I'm a fool who'll go for any line
Then honey, put down all your money, you win every time

Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way you kiss
Irresistible
Oh mama, I wish I could resist

All my partners ask me why I take so much abuse
Why am I so faithful, honey? Why are you so loose?
They say why am I the one who never gets to take you home?
But they don't know the things you do to me when we're alone

Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way you kiss
Irresistible
Oh mama, I wish I could resist

Hurt me, hurt me

Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
You're stealing all my honey, baby, keep you by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke

Hell if I know why I let u drive my car
Don't I know that walking won't get me very far?
Sure I know that crying over u is just in vain
But all things I lose don't add up to all the things I gain

Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way you kiss
Ain't it a shame?
Irresistible
Oh mama, mama, I wish I could resist
Hurt me!

Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
Stealing all my honey, baby, keep you by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke

Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody
Irresistible bitch
Irresistible bitch
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody
Irresistible bitch
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody
Irresistible bitch
