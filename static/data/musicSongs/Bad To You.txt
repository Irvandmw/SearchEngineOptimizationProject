Lyrics:


Hello, Charlie
Ariana, Normani, uh, let's go

Baby, I've been feeding the addiction
Flying from there and back
Felt like an acrobat
Brown eyed so I fell into submission
Needed to catch myself
Like "What the hell?"

Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up, wake you up
Push you 'til you break
Now you're stepping up, stepping up, huh huh

Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
(Tell me why) Are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)

Stopped thinking like a victim
This time I'll throw it back
Boy, can you handle that?
Got you trippin', gave you no attention
That's when I figured out
What you're about

Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up, wake you up
Push you 'til you break
Now you're stepping up, stepping up, huh huh

Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
(Tell me why) Are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)

Why you only nice when I get bad, boy, psha
Get back on your job like you employed, boy, psha
You know that I'm saucy, got that sauce, soy, psha
I ain't 'bout to stay up on this merry-go-round around
'Cause we go 'round and 'round
But I don't want no clowns around me
I tell him "Who is you cuffin'?"
I got him huffin' and puffin'
He keep on callin' me "baby"
Like I'm a bun in the oven
I said

Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
(Tell me why) Are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
