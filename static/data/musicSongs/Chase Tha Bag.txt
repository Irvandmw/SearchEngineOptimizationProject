Lyrics:


(Steve J beats)

I'm not patient, it's fast, tired of blue faces, don't fly to me
You bought a designer but I know you niggas ain't flyer than me
I'm feeling like Floyd, 50, and you know how I'm tryna be
Mask on, mask off, these niggas ain't robbing me
They killed my dawg and I can't believe it
So we had to air that big bag
I seen the wall safe, I had to keep it, we had to run up the sacks
I swear my drawers Tommy Hilfiger I had to order the safe
And my pocket stay fat
Pull up in a Maybach

Chase the bag and the Louis V's, I ain't gotta buy Supreme
Ask lil' shawty "is you rolling, baby," 'cause I'm 'bout to buy the bean
And I gotta get this package off, uncle gotta buy the piece
Can't nobody do it better, Louis V sweater, Prada by the jeans
Got two thousand and we made it double, my niggas had to invest
You ain't got the doughty, I give my man fifty, get hollows ripping through your chest
We been trappin' for a couple months, I made a hundred thousand on the roll
Racks bustin' out the Balmain's, I just make it, count it, then I fold
Got them Christian Louboutins on I just say that I'm feeling like Jesus
And I got a couple cars on me, we was traveling and making them visas
F&N gon' try is vest, call the choppa Lil' Ceaser
I move my family right outta the hood
Yah yah yah

I'm not patient, it's fast, tired of blue faces, don't fly to me
You bought a designer but I know you niggas ain't flyer than me
I'm feeling like Floyd, 50, and you know how I'm tryna be
Mask on, mask off, these niggas ain't robbing me
They killed my dawg and I can't believe it
So we had to air that big bag
I seen the wall safe, I had to keep it, we had to run up the sacks
I swear my drawers Tommy Hilfiger I had to order the safe
And my pocket stay fat
Pull up in a Maybach

Drunk my faygo with the lean,, baby, I just drink it out the bottle
Why you openin' your jeans, baby, I just want a little swallow
And she fucking with a nigga 'cause I got the Roley cracking in the Tahoe
Keep a 9 like Rondo, tryna run it out with Dambo
If that nigga try to talk about it on the Motorola he the Five-O
And My main bitch say she bout to get her face tatted like the fine ho
Came from eating ramen dawg, now I'm on a boat
My uncle Marley tried to run it up, the police shot him in the throat
Young nigga on the boulevard I was running with the vets
Member I had to go get me a TEC, now I keep a Patek
And you can't be hood rich if you ain't fucking up a check
Y'all niggas ain't hood rich if you ain't fucking up a check

I'm not patient, it's fast, tired of blue faces, don't fly to me
You bought a designer but I know you niggas ain't flyer than me
I'm feeling like Floyd, 50, and you know how I'm tryna be
Mask on, mask off, these niggas ain't robbing me
They killed my dawg and I can't believe it
So we had to air that big bag
I seen the wall safe, I had to keep it, we had to run up the sacks
I swear my drawers Tommy Hilfiger I had to order the safe
And my pocket stay fat
Pull up in a Maybach
