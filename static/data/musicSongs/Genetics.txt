My genetics
My genetics
My genetics
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S

Beauty queen since seventeen
At least to me, I was born with it
Maybelline is good to me
But I believe, I was born with it

I'm workin', workin', workin'
I've been workin' on myself
But I can't take cred
'Cause it's from somebody else
Watch me work it, work it, work it
I've been sweatin' on myself
All them boys, all them girls, make 'em stop

How you get that bod?
Is it from God?
Did you work real hard?
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
How you get that bass?
Is it all fake?
Made in LA
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S

My DNA is graded A
You see this face, I was born with it
I ain't ashamed to say one day
I might upgrade, I could fuss with it

I'm workin', workin', workin'
I've been workin' on myself
But I can't take cred
'Cause it's from somebody else
Watch me work it, work it, work it
I've been sweatin' on myself
All them boys, all them girls, make 'em stop

How you get that bod? (bod)
Is it from God?
Did you work real hard? (oh)
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
How you get that bass? (how you get that?)
Is it all fake? (is it all fake?)
Made in LA (oh)
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S

My genetics
My genetics (is it from God?)
My genetics
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
My genetics
My genetics (is it from God?)
My genetics
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S

My genetics
My genetics
My genetics
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
My genetics
My genetics
My genetics
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S

How you get that bod? (how you get that bod?)
Is it from God? (is it from God?)
Did you work real hard? (did you work real hard?)
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
How you get that bass?
Is it all fake? (tell me, is it all fake?)
Made in LA (made in LA)
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S

My genetics
My genetics (is it from God?)
My genetics
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
My genetics
My genetics (is it from God?)
My genetics
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
