Lyrics:


Daily
I've been waiting
For the time to pass
And let it fade in
But baby
My patience is driving me crazy
Making me fall apart

What do you do
When the truth
Isn't quite enough?
They looking at you
Telling you
We need to break it up

You need to trust what you do
It's you and me in love
But I'mma make it up to you
And show the world

I'm a changed man
'Cause you mean that much to me
I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand

So can we love
Can we love [5x]
Can we love again
Girl, I know I told you
Baby, this ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over

I remember your touch
God I miss you so much
Please believe me, baby. I'm sorry
And all of this money and fame
Can never amount
To every morning when I see your face

What do you do
When the truth
Isn't quite enough?
They looking at you
Telling you
We need to break it up
You need to trust what you do
It's you and me in love
But I'mma make it up to you
And show the world

I'm a changed man
'Cause you mean that much to me
I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand

So can we love
Can we love [5x]
Can we love again
Girl, I know I told you
Baby, this ain't over
It ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over, baby
It ain't over

Saying I'm sorry doesn't make it alright
I know I know
But I believe that we can make it if we try
If we try

I'm a changed man
'Cause you mean that much to me
And I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand

So can we love
Can we love [5x]
Can we love again
Girl, I know I told you
Baby, this ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over

It ain't over
It ain't over
It ain't over
