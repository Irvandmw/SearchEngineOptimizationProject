Lyrics:


(Aye, come over real quick, let me holler at you real quick)
Uh

Man fuck all that talking, my nigga let's link
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Drop your location, my nigga let's meet
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Smoke I want all of that, bitch where the beef?
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Ain't tryna drop by, I'ma hop out on feet
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street

Stop making songs, get off that phone
Bring your ass on, it's been too long
I got a hunnid round drum on that K
I shoot at niggas, I don't shoot at homes
Why that boy hating? 'Cause that nigga pussy
Send me a stepper, don't send me no rookie
You hoe niggas lucky that I'm good at rapping
'Cause I would've been came and seen 'bout that capping
'Cause I would've been came and seen 'bout that action
If that's how he feel he gon' stand on it
I'm upping as soon as my hand on it
This bitch a guitar, I'ma jam on it
Shoot up his car and then stand on it
Come bring your hoe-ass outside
My niggas know I'ma ride

Man fuck all that talking, my nigga let's link
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Drop your location, my nigga let's meet
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Smoke I want all of that, bitch where the beef?
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Ain't tryna drop by, I'ma hop out on feet
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street

Bring your ass on bitch I'm waiting
Matter fact bitch I'm getting impatient
I make your ass do the race
Chase your ass down like I'm Jason
I done got tired of your bitch ass
I put that rod on your bitch ass
I heard you was giving out smoke
Well I'ma get high on your bitch ass
I swear to God I'ma on his ass
As soon as you see me it's up
Why you think you ain't see me get touched
'Cause these niggas ain't really with that
My niggas can't wait to fix that
We come kick the door at your kickback
Shoot at you and your bros 'til it click-clack
Then go fuck on your hoe for some get-back

Man fuck all that talking, my nigga let's link
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Drop your location, my nigga let's meet
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Smoke I want all of that, bitch where the beef?
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Ain't tryna drop by, I'ma hop out on feet
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
Bring your bitch ass up the street
