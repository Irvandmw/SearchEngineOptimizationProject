Lyrics:


Lines in your misplaced palms
Fit perfectly
Where they're meant to be
Right in front of me

So, darling, you used to, yeah, you used to
Squeeze me
Like you haven't seen me
In eternity

Don't make me listen to you get sick of me
It's in your voice when you say
"Just leave me be"

Rock me to sleep, babe
But don't watch me cry
It's too much to handle
When you aren't by
Yeah, I'm missing you
Oh, the old you

Move every loop in your curly cue hair
To make memories
Of when you loved me
Yeah, you loved me

Rock me to sleep babe
But don't watch me cry
It's too much to handle
When you aren't by
Yeah, I'm missing you
Oh, the old you
