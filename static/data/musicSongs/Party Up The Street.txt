Lyrics:


(EarDrummers)

I'm sure that you know where I stand
Lead me on, do it while you still can
Party up the street
Even though there is no place to park
Party up the street
And you know what happens after dark

You could see our feet from the street
Since the garage was halfway open
Our eyes didn't meet until we started rolling

Party up the street
Even though there is no place to park
Party up the street
And you know what happens after dark

The way that you're moving your body on my knee
Soon as I put it on you, you want a go at me
We didn't come this close for nothing
We didn't come this far for nothing

Party up the street
Even though there is no place to park
Party up the street
And you know what happens after dark

You can count on me, okay?
(You and me, we can be okay)
We can rock like an ocean wave
(We can roll, we can roll, we can roll, we can rock, aye)
You and me, we can be okay
(You and me, we can be okay)
We can go out with a bang

(Party up the street)
The way that you're moving your body on my knee
(Party up the street)
The way that you're moving your body on my knee
(Party up the street)
The way that you're moving your body on my knee
(Party up the street)
The way that you're moving your body on my knee

(And you know what happens after dark)
The way that you're moving your body on my knee
(And you know what happens after dark)
The way that you're moving your body on my knee
(And you know what happens after dark)

(Yeah, yeah)
And you know what happens after dark
And you know what happens after dark
And you know what happens after dark
