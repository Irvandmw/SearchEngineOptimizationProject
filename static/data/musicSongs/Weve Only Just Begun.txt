Lyrics:


We've only just begun, to live, 
White lace an' promises,  
A kiss for luck an' we're on our way...  

(We've only just begun!) 

Before the rising sun, we fly, 
So many roads to choose,  
We start out walkin' an' learn to run...  
An' yes, we've just begun...  

Sharin' horizons that are new to us,  
Watchin' the signs along the way,  
Talkin' it over, just the two of us,  
Workin' together day to day...  

Together... (Together!) 

An' when the evening comes, we smile, 
So much of life ahead,  
We'll find a place where there's room to grow...  
We've only just begun (...just begun!) 
We've only just begun (We've only just begun!) 

Sharin' horizons that are new to us,  
Watchin' the signs along the way,  
Talkin' it over, just the two of us,  
Workin' together day to day...  

Together... (Together!) 

An' when the evening comes, we smile, 
So much of life ahead,  
We'll find a place where there's room to grow...  
We've only just begun (...just begun!) 
We've only just begun (We've only just begun!) 

We've only just begun...
