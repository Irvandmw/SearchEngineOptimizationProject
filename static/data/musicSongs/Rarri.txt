Lyrics:


I just bought a Rari then I switched lanes (Skrt skrt)
Ice drip like water, and it's in the rain
I hopped in the coupe, my bro hopped in a range
Stack my fucking bread we on the same thing (On the same thing)
I just bought a Rari then I switched lanes (Switched lanes)
Ice drip like water, and it's in the rain
I hopped in the coupe, my bro hopped in a range (That my twin)
Stack my fucking bread we on the same thing (My Gucci tats)

I'm the youngest nigga, face it (You don't say shit)
Mr. Bean, pour the wok when I be stressing
I just want her for thats what I mentioned
I be in the hills, I'm in a mansion
I touched a band when I flipped a brick
Don't say shit to me, my niggas empty shit
Ran up on your plug, ran him for his shit
He ain't say a word, man I swear he a bitch
I just stole your hoe, and I told that bitch suck me
And you nigga fu, you lying you don't tuck heat
I just take the money, you can't get no shit from me
And she see some bands, and I know thats why she loves me

I just bought a Rari then I switched lanes (Skrt skrt)
Ice drip like water, and it's in the rain
I hopped in the coupe, my bro hopped in a range
Stack my fucking bread we on the same thing (On the same thing)
I just bought a Rari then I switched lanes (Switched lanes)
Ice drip like water, and it's in the rain
I hopped in the coupe, my bro hopped in a range (That my twin)
Stack my fucking bread we on the same thing
