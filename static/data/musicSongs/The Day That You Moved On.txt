Lyrics:


Found myself alone
With nothing but a dialogue inside
Fear it comes from me
Falling from the razor's edge
But when it leaves
What's the point if only failure awaits me?
I feel like giving up

Love is a hole that drains from me...

Yesterday you moved away from me
Your apathy is clear
I know it's only fair
But I will miss you idiosyncrasies
How I long for moments when
I don't have grief
For all I've lost in you and me

All the blood - it drains from me...

The day that you moved on
The day that you moved on
The day that you moved on
The day that you moved on...

Ohh.....

The day that you moved on
The day that you moved on
The day that you moved on
The day that you moved on
The day that you moved on...
