Lyrics:


I'm-i-e-i-e-i-e-i-e-i-e-i p-plastic
P-plastic do-o-o-o-oll
P-plastic, technologic

Open me up and cut me loose
I come with a purse and new shoes
Am I your type?
Am I your type?
(Oh-la-la, oh-la-la, oh-oh, oh-la-la)
I've lived in a pink box so long
I am top shelf, they built me strong
Am I your type?
Am I your type?
(Oh-la-la, oh-la-la, oh-oh, oh-la-la)

'Cause I've spent too long
Dancing all alone
Dancing to the same song
I'm no toy for a real boy
(Oh-la-la, oh-la-la)
If you're a real boy

Don't play with me, it just hurts me
I'm bouncing off the walls
No-no-no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)

I've got blonde hair and cherry lips
I'm state of art, Iâm microchipped
Am I your type?
Am I your type?
(Oh-la-la, oh-la-la, ooh-ooh, oh-la-la)

'Cause I've spent too long
Dancing all alone
Dancing to the same song
I'm no toy for a real boy
(Oh-la-la, oh-la-la)
If you're a real boy

Don't play with me, it just hurts me
I'm bouncing off the walls
No-no-no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)
Don't play with me, it just hurts me
I'm bouncing off the walls
No-no-no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)

Tell me, who dressed you?
Where'd you get that hat?
Why is she crying, what's the price tag?
Who's that girl, Malibu Gaga?
Looks so sad, what is this saga?
Oh

Don't play with me, it just hurts me
I'm bouncing off the walls
No-no-no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)
Don't play with me, it just hurts me
I'm bouncing off the walls
No-no-no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)

I'm-i-e-i-e-i-e-i-e-i-e-i p-plastic
P-plastic do-o-o-o-oll
P-plastic, technologic
I'm-i-e-i-e-i-e-i-e-i-e-i p-plastic
P-plastic do-o-o-o-oll
P-plastic, technologic
