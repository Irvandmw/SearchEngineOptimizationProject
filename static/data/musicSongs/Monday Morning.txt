Lyrics:


I can always find the time to lay out in the sand
Watching as the waves roll by it makes me understand
What it is to make a life that means a little more
Seems so easy to forget what weâre all looking for

I donât know where Iâm going just yet
Skipping work and I donât need to excuse it
Long as that floating feeling I get in the moment
Makes it really worth it (makes it really worth it)

Hey, forget about your Monday morning
We are never gonna be that boring
Hey, forget about your Monday morning
So-so ordinary, same old story

Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o
Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o
Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o

I had a party, it went long, I told âem all to stay
Neighbors calling to complain and rain on our parade
They told me to use my head and keep my focus straight
Shame on all of you for being stiff and so straight-laced

Let them keep talking, I donât regret
They canât help it, caught up in their mindset
Long as that floating feeling I get in the moment
Makes it really worth it (makes it really worth it)

Hey, forget about your Monday morning
We are never gonna be that boring
Hey, forget about your Monday morning
So-so ordinary, same old story

Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o
No we donât wanna go, no we donât wanna go
Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o
Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o
No we donât wannao, no we donât wanna go

Nani, naki, nana, nani, naki, nana
Nani, naki, nana, nani, naki, nana
Nani, naki, nana, nani, naki, nana
Nani, naki, nana, nani, naki, nana

Sweet shot cherry pop
Everybody go to the beat, donât stop
Keep up body rock cardiac arrest
Itâs a culture shock

Hey, forget about your Monday morning
We are never gonna be that boring
Hey, forget about your Monday morning
So-so ordinary, same old story

Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o
No we donât wanna go, no we donât wanna go
Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o
Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o
No we donât wannao, no we donât wanna go
