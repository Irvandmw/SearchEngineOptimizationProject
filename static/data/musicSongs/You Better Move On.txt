Lyrics:


You ask me to give up a hand of the girl I love
You tell me I'm not the man she's worthy of
But who are you to tell her who to love
That's up to her yes and the Lord above
You better move on

I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings
But I believe she's happy with me without these things
Still you beg me to set her free friend that'll never be
You better move on

I can't blame you of loving her
Can't you understand man she's my girl
And I Lord I'm never ever gonna let her go
Cause I Lord I you know that I love her so

I think you'd better go now I'm gettin' mighty mad
You ask me to give up the only love I ever gad
Maybe I would but I love her so I'm never gonna let her go
You better move on you better move on
You better move on movin' on you better move on
