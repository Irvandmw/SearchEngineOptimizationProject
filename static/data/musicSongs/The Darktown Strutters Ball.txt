Lyrics:


I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey
You'd better be ready around half past eight
Ah baby don't be late I want to be there when the band starts honey

Well just remember when we get there honey
Two steps gonna handle them all
Dance with both my shoes when they play the jelly roll blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutter's ball

Well I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey
You'd better be ready around half past eight
Ah baby don't be late I want to be there when the band starts honey

Just remember when we get there honey
Two steps and gonna handle them all
Dance off both my shoes when they play the jelly roll blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutter's ball

I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey
You'd better be ready around half past eight
Ah baby don't be late I want to be there when the band starts honey

Just remember when we get there honey
Two steps gonna handle them all
I'm gonna dance off both my shoes when they play the jelly roll blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutter's ball
