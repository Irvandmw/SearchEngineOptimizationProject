Lyrics:


When did you fall?
When did you fall out from heaven
When did you fall?
When did you fall out from heaven

So beautiful,
I'm lucky that you're mine
Your beauty's blinding me
Can't look you in your eyes

Please excuse me,
I'm speechless
Can't believe this has happened to me

When did you fall out from heaven
Why did you come straight to me
Somebody sent me an angel from heaven
Who could it be
Who could it be,
Who loves me

So breathless
Can't stop calling me now
Tell me,
Are you my angel from above?

Please excuse me,
I'm speechless
Can't believe this has happened to me

When did you fall out from heaven
Why did you come straight to me
Somebody sent me an angel from heaven
Who could it be
Who could it be,
Who loves me

I don't know why
He could be mine
Am I good enough
You see
That he's everything
I could ever want
He is perfect for me

When did you fall out from heaven
Why did you come straight to me
Somebody sent me an angel from heaven
Who could it be
Who could it be,
Who loves me

When did you fall out from heaven
Why did you come straight to me
Somebody sent me an angel from heaven
Who could it be
Who could it be,
Who loves me
