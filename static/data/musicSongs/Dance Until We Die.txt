Lyrics:


Best believe my body's focused
I'm ready to begin
No need for demonstrations
I do this for the win

And I feel light
As he moves me 'cross the floor
I keep it in time
Ooh, he's got me wanting more and more and more

Hold me, baby, we can dance until we die
Let's take the middle of the floor and do it right
I, I can, I can pretend to love you
I'll, I'll try, I'll, I'll try not to fall for you
Hold me, baby, we can dance until we die
Let's take the middle of the floor and do it right
I, I can, I can pretend to love you
I'll, I'll try, I'll, I'll try not to fall for you

No need for motivation
Your beauty is to blame
Our chemistry is crazy
Don't even know your name

And I feel alive
When we move across the floor
Boy, keep it in time
You got me wanting more and more and more and more

Hold me, baby, we can dance until we die
Let's take the middle of the floor and do it right
I, I can, I can pretend to love you
I'll, I'll try, I'll, I'll try not to fall for you
Hold me, baby, we can dance until we die
Let's take the middle of the floor and do it right
I, I can, I can pretend to love you
I'll, I'll try, I'll, I'll try not to fall for you

I want you to take me, take me
I want you to take me, take me (T-take me)
I want you to take me, take me (Come on and take me)
I want you to take me, take me
I want you to take me, take me (Baby, come and take me)
I want you to take me, take me
So I want you to take me, take me

Hold me, baby, we can dance until we die
Let's take the middle of the floor and do it right
I, I can, I can pretend to love you
I'll, I'll try, I'll, I'll try not to fall for you
Hold me, baby, we can dance until we die
Let's take the middle of the floor and do it right
I, I can, I can pretend to love you
I'll, I'll try, I'll, I'll try not to fall for you

Oh, take me
Come on and take me
Oh, take me
Come on and take me
