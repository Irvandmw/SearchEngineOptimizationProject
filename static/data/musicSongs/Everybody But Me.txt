Lyrics:


Everybody's got somebody carin'
Everybody's got alove they're sharin'
Everybody, everybody but me

Everybody is gettin' ready
Everybody is goin' steady
Everybody, everybody but me

I stay home on Friday night, go to bed at eight
On Saturday nights I'm all alone
'Cause I don't have a date

Everybody's out romancin'
Havin' fun and goin' dancin'
Everybody, everybody but me

I stay home on Friday night, go to bed at eight
On Saturday nights I'm all alone
'Cause I don't have a date

Everybody's out romancin'
Havin' fun and goin' dancin'
Everybody, everybody but me
Everybody, everybody but me
