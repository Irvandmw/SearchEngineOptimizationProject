Lyrics:


[Intro]
Pump up the peculiar
While I yell unique
Ah, let me show you right here
Hey, Ah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I'm well on my way
I'm almost everything
And this is my day
You make me want to say

[Hook]
I'm free! Look at me!
Behold everything I'm allowed to see
Free,! Come and see
Na, na, na, na, na na na

[Verse]
The shapeless, formless, heart is enormous
Bore this, I've worn this, no never what the norm is
Come hear this, it's fearless
Contrast, colour, wisdom's a woman
Listen and love her

[Hook #2]
I'm free! Look at me!
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Free! come and see
Na, na, na, na, na na na

[Verse]
What you waitin' on?
I want action, passion, smilin', laughin'
Yieldin', feelin', helpin', healin'
Introduce your neighbour to your saviour

[Hook #3]
I'm free! Look at me!
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Free!
Na, na, na, na, na na na
