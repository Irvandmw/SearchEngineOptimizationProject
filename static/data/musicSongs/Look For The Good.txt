Lyrics:


Look for the good in everything
Look for the people who will set your soul free
It always seems impossible until it's done
Look for the good in everyone

Look for the good in everything
Look for the people who will set your soul free
It always seems impossible until it's done
Look for the good in everyone

People done gone crazy, people done gone mad
People done forgot the superpowers we all have
We were born to love, not hate
We can decide our fate
And look for the good in everyone
And celebrate all our mistakes
If there's a silver lining (silver lining)
You still have to find it, find it, find it

Look for the good in everything
Look for the people who will set your soul free
It always seems impossible until it's done
Look for the good in everyone

Everyone needs sunshine, everyone needs rain
Everyone is carrying around some kind of pain
I see who you are, you're just like me
I see you're searching for a purpose, guided by a dream
I see who you are, I'm just like you
I get lost sometimes and I forget what I came here to do
I keep on trying (keep on trying)
When it gets frightening

Look for the good in everything
Look for the people who will set your soul free
It always seems impossible until it's done
Look for the good
Look for the good
Look for the good in everyone

Everyone is nature, everyone is God
Everyone is love and light and vibration
Look for the good, look for the good
Everyone gets mad sometimes and maybe they should
Look for the good
Look for the good
Yeah, look out for all the heroes in your neighborhood
Look for the good
Look for the good
Life sure would be sweeter if everybody would

Look for the good in everything
Look for the people who will set your soul free
It always seems impossible until it's done
Look for the good
Look for the good
Look for the good in everyone
