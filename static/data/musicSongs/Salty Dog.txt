Lyrics:


Let me be your salty dog
I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog

I can see you standing there
I just gotta stop and stare
Honey let me be your salty dog

If you'd only speak to me
I'd be happy as could be
Honey let me be your salty dog

I can't think of what to say
You just make me feel that way
Honey let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog

If you wanna see this boy
Jumpin' up and down for joy
Honey let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog

I can't buy you diamond rings
But there's always other things
Honey let me be your salty dog

I can see you by my side
If you'd only be my bride
Honey let me be your salty dog

Please don't leave me in the cold
Won't you take this band of gold
Honey let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog
