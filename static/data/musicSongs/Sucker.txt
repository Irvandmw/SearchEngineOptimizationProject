Lyrics:


We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
'Cause I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you, 'bout you, 'bout you
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
'Cause it's true, I'm a sucker for you

Don't complicate it
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember, yeah, all of the nights
I can't remember when you're 'round me

I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
'Cause I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you, about you, about you
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you

I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
'Cause I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you, about you, about you
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
All the subliminal things
No one knows about you, about you, about you
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you
