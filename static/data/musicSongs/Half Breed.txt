Lyrics:


Your pappy was a traitor and your mammy was an Indian maid boy
Your pappy was a traitor and your mammy was an Indian maid boy
We know all about it and we don't want a half breed around boy
Tomorrow by sunrise, better be outta town boy

Half breed, they're hot on your trail boy
Half Breed but you'd better not run
Half breed you'd better get a gun boy
Better get a gun and stand boy
Better get a gun and stand

A man is a man as long as he can stand and think straight
A man is a man as long as he can stand and wait boy
So don't let 'em dog you, no don't let 'em no don't you let 'em boy
You're a human bein' and you're just as good as them boy

Half breed, they're hot on your trail boy
Half Breed but you'd better not run
Half breed you'd better get a gun boy
Better get a gun and stand boy
Better get a gun and stand
