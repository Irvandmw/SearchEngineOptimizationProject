[Intro:]
M-M-M-Murda

[6ix9ine:]
She want me, I ain't want her, ooh
She want me to be her boo
You so silly, don't get it confused
Now turn around, drop it low, pick it up, ooh
Big bank, we gettin' paid over here
Broke niggas, go stand over there
Fake ass hoes, go meet 'em over there
Little booties, they ain't matter over here
Now stop

Wait a minute, now I'm back at it
Back at it like a motherfucking crack addict
Sex addict, I'm a motherfuckin' sex addict
Hit shorty from the back, got her back crackin'
Back crackin', b-back crackin'
I love hoe bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
Yeah, I like to fuck hoes, I got a fuckin' problem
Bang, bang, bang and a chicken wing, bitch
Yeah, I know you love how I put it down, bitch
Drop down and pick your weave up, girl
Drop down and get your Eagle on, girl
Head downtown and pick the eaters up, girl
You know them chicken-heads eat it up, girl

She want me, I ain't want her, ooh
She want me to be her boo
You so silly, don't get it confused
Now turn around, drop it low, pick it up, ooh
Big bank, we gettin' paid over here
Broke niggas, go stand over there
Fake ass hoes, go meet 'em over there
Little booties, they ain't matter over here

[Kanye West:]
That pussy get wetter than yours
That head is better than yours
[6ix9ine:]
I flew her out so I could fuck on tour
Flew her back, 'cause my girlfriend's sore
[Kanye West:]
They tried to say I wasn't black no more
About as black as Macklemore
[6ix9ine:]
They don't like me 'cause I'm Mexican
Sent me back, now I'm back again
[Kanye West:]
Uh, just bought a piece of Fashion Nova
Your girlfriend look like a ogre
[6ix9ine:]
Nigga, fat bitches need love too
My fault, Ye, I wasn't sober
[Kanye West:]
Who the fuck gon' listen to Ebro? (Ebro)
All these niggas so emo
[6ix9ine:]
Fuck that nigga, I'm the motherfucking shit
Another old nigga on a young nigga dick
[Kanye West:]
N-N-Niggas tried to say that I was canceled (canceled)
When I asked them questions, couldn't answer
[6ix9ine:]
How Ye? How Ye? How, Sway? Nigga it's fucking-

[TrifeDrew:]
Yo, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, whoa, whoa, whoa
You cannot say that, bro, c'mon

[6ix9ine:]
She want me, I ain't want her, ooh
She want me to be her boo
You so silly, don't get it confused
Now turn around, drop it low, pick it up, ooh
Big bank, we gettin' paid over here
Broke niggas, go stand over there
Fake ass hoes, go meet 'em over there
Little booties, they ain't matter over here
Now stop
