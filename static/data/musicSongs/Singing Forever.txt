Lyrics:


[Mark:]
You took my hand, long ago
And you've been by my side always
I didn't know where to go
You showed me the way
Ohhh.. who knows what the future holds? Ohhh.. we'll never know 

[Chorus:]
Nobody thought that we'd still be together
They all said we'd fall to the floor
No matter the fight, we'll survive any weather
We'll prove them wrong
Keep singing forever

[Shane:]
As I lay here beside you
And I look in your eyes
I know without you in my life
It just wouldn't seem right

[Mark:]
Ohhh.. who knows what the future holds?
Ohhh.. we'll never know

[Chorus:]
Nobody thought that we'd still be together
They all said we'd fall to the floor
No matter the fight, we'll survive any weather
We'll prove them wrong
Keep singing forever

[Mark:]
We'll never know...

[Repeat Chorus]
