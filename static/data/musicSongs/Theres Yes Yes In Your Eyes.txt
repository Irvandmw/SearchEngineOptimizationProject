Lyrics:


Your lips tell me no no
But there's yes yes in your eyes
I've been missing your kissing just because I wasn't wise
I'll stop my scheming and dreaming 'cuz I realize
Your lips tell me no no
But there's yes yes in your eyes

[Spoken:] Come over here honey, I'm not going to hurt you
Let me talk to you

Your lips tell me no no
But there's yes yes in your eyes
Well I've been missing your kissing just because I wasn't wise
Well I'll stop my scheming and dreaming 'cuz I just realized
Well your lips tell me no no
But there's yes yes in your eyes
