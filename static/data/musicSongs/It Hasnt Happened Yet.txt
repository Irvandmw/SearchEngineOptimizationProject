Lyrics:


You said that I would be sorry if you went away
You said I wouldn't be happy without hell to pay
You said the teardrops would fall
Between the bedroom walls
You said that I would regret
But it hasn't happened yet

Your friends come over and offer to take me to eat
They seem so sorry I'm sufferin' so much misery
They say, give me a call, next time I start to crawl
I always say, yeah you bet
But it hasn't happened yet

I don't have anyone, I'm havin' lots of fun
No one is into me, no ones a mystery
I see you on the street, my heart don't skip a beat
All your hostility, don't mean a thing to me

I find it hard to remember, the good times we had
Call me insensitive, now that it's over I'm glad
You said that when shadows fell
It would be to hard to tell
My life from your silhouette
But it hasn't happened yet
Hasn't happened yet
