Lyrics:


I didn't know how much I loved you baby
Til you left me girl and I heard this song
I thought that i could forget you
Lord knows how I meant to
Somehow this old fool figured it wrong

No words of love were spoken
No tears of sadness were shed
There were no unseen tomorrow's
No commitments or sorrows
Just a kiss goodbye and good luck old friend

You stood by my side when I was lonesome
You made me warm when I was feelin' old
I'll miss the light of your smile
Your the music that I will
Play in my heart my whole life long

No words of love were spoken
No tears of sadness were shed
There were no unseen tomorrow's
No commitments or sorrows
Just a kiss goodbye and good luck old friend

No words of love were spoken
No tears of sadness were shed
There were no unseen tomorrow's
No commitments or sorrows
Just a kiss goodbye and good luck old friend
