Lyrics:


The lady with the big umbrella
Her name is Roseabella
You'll always see her with a fella
And her pink and yella umbrella

She isn't much for fancy dancing
But this girl sure love romancing
She's the lady with the big umbrella
And her name is Roseabella

With her umbrella in her hand
She's never shy and that's the reason why
She has a guy that's why
For love's a thing she really knows there is no doubt
For what it's all about she has found out

So plan a trip to Venezuela
You must see Roseabella
You'll always see her with a fella
And a pink and yella umbrella

(La la la la la la la la...)
(La la la la la la la la...)
(La la la la la la la la...)
(La la la la la la la la...)

With her umbrella in her hand
She's never shy and that's the reason why
She has a guy that's why
For love's a thing she really knows there is no doubt
For what it's all about she has found out

So plan a trip to Venezuela
You must see Roseabella
You'll always see her with a fella
'Cause some say that her umbrella
Is the way she gets her fella
But is it her umbrella
Or Roseabella
