Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The taste of love
you don't give up
The dream that grows in your mind
A touch of joy a glimpse of light
and you can't sleep at night

[Chorus:]
You want more
You want more
You want more
You wanna soar
Someone to adore
You want more

The sound of strings unfold your wings
And let's you fly inside your head
The smell of rain unlocks your chain
Makes you dreaming once again

[Chorus:]
You want more
You want more
You want more
You wanna soar
Someone to adore
You want more
