Lyrics:


Now, these are the Teen Commandments

1, stop and think
Before you drink
2, don't let your parents down
They brought you up

3, be humble enough to obey
You will be giving orders yourself someday
4, at the first moment, turn away
From unclean thinking at the first moment

5, don't show off driving
If you want to race, go to Indianapolis
6, choose a date who would make
A good mate

7, go to church faithfully, the Creator gives you the week
Give Him back an hour
8, choose your companions carefully
You are what they are

9, avoid following the crowd
Be an engine, not a caboose
10, or even better keep the original
Ten Commandments
