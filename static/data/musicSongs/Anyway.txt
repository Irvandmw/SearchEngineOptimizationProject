Lyrics:


[Chorus - Tayla Parx:]
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway

[Verse 1 - Chris Brown:]
I know you probably never had somebody
Loving you like I do, someone that's there for you
Don't judge ya cause I know we only human
I must be stupid babe, letting you slip away

[Pre-Chorus - Chris Brown & Tayla Parx:]
If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage, you no longer need to hide

[Chorus - Tayla Parx & Chris Brown:]
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway

[Verse 2 - Chris Brown:]
I wish that you could see you like I see you
It's like that you're no good, you're just misunderstood
Now it's my job to make you a believer
Them boys ain't like this man, can't love you like I can

[Pre-Chorus - Chris Brown & Tayla Parx:]
If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage, you no longer need to hide

[Chorus - Tayla Parx & Chris Brown:]
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway

[Bridge - Chris Brown:]
Lemme get it like
(Way-ay-ay-ay) [x3]
Lemme get it like
(Way-ay-ay-ay) [x3]
Lemme get it like
(Way-ay-ay-ay) [x3]
Lemme get it like

[Chorus - Tayla Parx & Chris Brown:]
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway
Cause I'm a love you anyway
