Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You're not a dream, you're not an angel
You're a man
I'm not a queen, I'm a woman
Take my hand

We'll make a space in the lives
That we'd planned
And here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Yes, we're different, worlds apart
We're not the same
We laughed and played at the start
Like in a game

You could have stayed outside my heart
But in you came
And here you'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Don't ask why
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever
Love me, love me, just love me now

This love of mine, had no beginning
And it has no end
I was an oak but now I'm a willow
Now I can bend

You're not a dream, you're not an angel
You're a man
I'm not a queen, I'm a woman
Just take my hand

We'll make a space in the lives
That we'd planned
And here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Until it's time for you to go
