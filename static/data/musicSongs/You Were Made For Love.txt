Lyrics:


(Baby baby baby you were made for love)
(Baby baby baby you were made for love)
Your beautiful eyes your wonderful lips
They were just made for moonlight trips
Oh baby love you were made for love
(Baby baby baby you were made for love)

The way that you smile the way that you kiss
There could be just one answer to this
Oh baby doll you were made for love
(Oh baby doll you were made for love)
Oh there's a ring around the moon tonight
It means we ought to linger
Oh babe I love you so I'd like to put
The ring around the moon around your finger

Oh what a break is waiting ahead
For some lucky guy who you're gonna wed
Oh baby doll you were made for love

(Oh there's a ring around the moon tonight)
It means we ought to linger
(It means I love you so I'd like to put)
The ring around the moon around your finger

Oh what a break is waiting ahead
For some lucky guy who you're gonna wed
Oh baby doll you were made for love
(Baby doll you were made for love)
