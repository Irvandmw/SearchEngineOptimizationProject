Lyrics:


I wasn't up, but now I'm knowin' how it feel
Stayed loyalty to these niggas, looked around and they ain't here
Cut yourself out the circle, nigga tell me how it feel
I got it out the mud nigga, nigga that's just how I feel
You wasn't with a nigga when I was down for real
Had to cut my main bitch off, she wasn't down for real
Tried to infiltrate the circle, he out of bounds for real
A lot of these niggas ain't down for real

Would you put down on my books if I was trapped behind that wall?
Just get trapped up in the jam, see how many niggas call
That's why I don't fuck with niggas, only bad bitches
Where was you at, nigga? When I was doin' bad, nigga
Now these niggas flood around, cause I got diamonds on my neck
Only fuck with loyal niggas, told my dawg to cut the check
I cut that bitch if she ain't comin' correct
Cause I got too many bitches to even stress
Tell my dawg to get that TEC, like Ron Artest
These niggas trap and then they ball for like half of the game
Made a profit with his dawg then spent half on a chain
I wonder why these groupies ain't call when I ain't have no name

I wasn't up, but now I'm knowin' how it feel
Stayed loyalty to these niggas, looked around and they ain't here
Cut yourself out the circle, nigga tell me how it feel
I got it out the mud nigga, nigga that's just how I feel
You wasn't with a nigga when I was down for real
Had to cut my main bitch off, she wasn't down for real
Tried to infiltrate the circle, he out of bounds for real
A lot of these niggas ain't down for real

My nigga just caught a 15 off the robbery, I ain't tryna do that
My old bitch done got my new number, keep callin' me, text her back like "who that?"
And my trap at the house, I gotta run up the cheese, I don't fuck with the rats
Gave handouts to these niggas, and I got struck in the back (aye)
And my nigga, we ain't cut from the same cloth, I'm in the street for real
Nigga I was trapped inside my problems, sippin' that lean for real
Young nigga touched bout thirty thousand, I ain't even seen a deal
Tryna get a three-piece out the trap for my team for real

A lot of these niggas say they down for real
But when he got up under pressure, he just fold
The pressure made me a diamond, I stood ten toes
I ain't have to sell my soul to sip this gold

I wasn't up, but now I'm knowin' how it feel
Stayed loyalty to these niggas, looked around and they ain't here
Cut yourself out the circle, nigga tell me how it feel
I got it out the mud nigga, nigga that's just how I feel
You wasn't with a nigga when I was down for real
Had to cut my main bitch off, she wasn't down for real
Tried to infiltrate the circle, he out of bounds for real
A lot of these niggas ain't down for real

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
These niggas ain't down for real
And that's just how I feel
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yea
