Lyrics:


Aaah yeah yeah
I see the spotlight in my dreams
I just wanna reach out
Find out what it's all about
I'll have to turn it in with
All leards of a different feather
Where they were together

No matter what may happen in our lives
You are you and I am I
I wanna rule the world
You wanna wake it up
But we're here for each other
No matter what

Like fire to the flame
Like water to rain
Like blue to the sky
You and I
Will stick up for each other
It's our time

Nothing's gonna break us apart
We'll always gonna shine in the dark
Wherever we go, wherever we are
We'll always be like two halfs of the... same heart!
Same heart!

Standing on top of the world
Everything is magic
You know that we have it
Even though we're two different girls
You know its okay, time to celebrate, yeah

It's the greatest moment of our lives
You are you, and I am I
I wanna rule the world
You wanna wake it up
But we're here for each other
No matter what

Like fire to the flame
Like water to rain
Like blue to the sky
You and I
Will stick up for each other
It's our time

Nothing's gonna break us apart
We'll always gonna shine in the dark
Wherever we go, wherever we are
We'll always be like two halfs of the... same heart!
Same heart!
Shine in the dark...
AH! Whoa!

Let's go girl!
Let's go girl!
Hey hey hey

Like fire to the flame
Like water to rain
Like blue to the sky
You and I
Will stick up for each other
It's our time

Nothing's gonna break us apart
We'll always gonna shine in the dark
Wherever we go, wherever we are
We'll always be like two halfs of the... same heart!
Same heart!
Yeah yeah yeah
Same heart!
