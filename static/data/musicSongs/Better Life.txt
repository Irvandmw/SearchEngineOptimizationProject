Lyrics:


I've been up late watching you breathe
Wondering if you're going to leave
Don't tell me what you see
That you actually believe it
Fuck, I'm blue
And all those photos that you like of a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
Goddamn right I miss drinking
Yeah, I do

I've been up late nights
Staring at the street lights
All the cigarette smoke, can't escape a closing window
And my head's like "What happened to, it's alright"
Baby, it's not alright
What if we're a closing window

But I can't shake the feeling
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
I can't shake the feeling
Do you picture a better life?

I found myself up late feeling kinda jealous
Looking at the bullshit, other peoples wellness
And it's got me thinking
It's just not you
I've been all night looking in the eyes of my baby
Right in front of me, what a gift so amazing
And that's what's true

But I stay up late night
Screaming at the street lights
All the cigarette smoke, filling up these hopeless lungs
Oh, and my head's like "What happens to, it's alright"
Baby, it's not alright
I feel like a closing window

But I can't shake the feeling
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
I can't shake the feeling
Do you picture a better life?

I can't seem to understand it
How did we get so low
No, no, no, no
I can't seem to understand it
How did we get so low
No, no, no

But I can't shake the feeling (I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low)
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high (no, no, no)
I can't shake the feeling (I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low)
Do you picture a better life?

Do you picture a better life?
Ooh, do you picture a better life?
And I wonder, and I wonder
Do you picture a better life? (Can't shake the feeling)
And I wonder (I can't shake the feeling)
Do you picture
Do you picture a better life?
