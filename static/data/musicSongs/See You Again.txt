Lyrics:


I got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must have known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said, "Oh, she's just being Miley."
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart: it can't rest 'til then
I, I can't wait to see you again

I got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said, "Oh, she's just being Miley."
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart: it can't rest 'til then
I, I can't wait to see you again

I got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said, "Oh, she's just being Miley."
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart: it can't rest 'til then
I, I can't wait to see you again

I, I can't wait to see you again
