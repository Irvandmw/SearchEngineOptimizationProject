Lyrics:


Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you

First spotted in my mind
Not figuring where I'm at in my life
Only I could ever change it up
Kind of stuck but I made my luck
And I know I gotta take control
I never wanna lean on you
You're defined by what you own
By my soul and it's rich in it's own

I don't ever back out alive
All I wanna do is call a shot
Ain't nobody got me all swept out
You're in my head, in my head by now

Moving on to better things
I'm afraid I'm the only king
Don't need you, that's how
I get through, a-ha

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you

Independent song
Only I could ever right my wrong
I don't drop when you hit the gong
And in my mind I decide how long
Which is I think I'm working for you
Deep in my heart you will do what I do
Gotta cause I gotta eat when I'm?
Felling the heat underneath my feet

Moving on to better things
I'm afraid I'm the only king
Don't need you, that's how
I get through, a-ha

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you

Must be the reason why I'm king of
Must be the reason why I'm king of

Uh, I want that soul control
Uh, I want that soul control
Uh, I want that soul control
Uh, I want that soul control
Uh, I want that soul control
Uh. I want that
Uh, I want that
Uh, I want that soul

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you
