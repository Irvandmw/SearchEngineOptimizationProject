Lyrics:


You said to go out and find another girl
Well I tried
Well yes I looked all over this world
And I tried
Some were pretty, some even rich
Still you know I'd rather fight than switch
'Cause each lonely day that I've been away
I've cried

I tried to forget you leave my past behind
I tried oh, and yet you seem to
Always be here on my mind

When you told me you never cared
You lied
Don't deny at times you were oh
So satisfied
I always knew that our love could be
If you'd only gone about it like me
I did the one thing you never seem to do
I tried

I tried to forget you leave my past behind
I tried oh, and yet you seem to
Always be here on my mind

When you told me you never cared
You lied
Don't deny at times you were oh
So satisfied
I always knew that our love could be
If you'd only gone about it like me
I did the one thing you never seem to do
I tried
I tried, I tried, I tried, baby I tried
I tried, baby I tried, I tried, baby I tried
