Lyrics:


[Kenny:]
You know that restaurant on highway 1
With the key lime pie that song the sand and the sun
Where we ran in our barefeet
Built a castle on the beach
Just the wind,the rocks, the waves and you and me

[Chorus:]
I can't go there
Cuz thats just too much us
I can't go there
I still feel your touch
Theres places in my heart and head that feel as empty as our bed
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs
Cuz I can't go there

Remember San Francisco on that cable car
Our reflection in the window of that store
How we danced the night away
With the lights out on the bay
Then wound up in a blanket on the floor

[Chorus:]
I can't go there
Cuz 'Friscos too much us
I can't go there
I still feel your touch
Now there's places in my heart and head that 
still feel as empty as our bed
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs
Cuz I can't go there

If it was only Florida or California 
Maybe I could let myself move on
But its everywhere we've been
And everywhere I turn
I can't love again 
Cuz I've learned

That I can't go there 
Its something I can't do
I can't go there
I'll run into you
I can't go there

[Tim Mcgraw:]
When the sun shines, when it rains
Christmas parties, football games

[Kenny:] I can't go there

[Tim:] Winter, summer, fall or spring
I see you in everything

I can't go there..
Its too much us
I can't go there
