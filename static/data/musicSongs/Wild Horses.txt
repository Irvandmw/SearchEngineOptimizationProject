Lyrics:


(Hi yup! Hi yup! Hi yup!) 

It would take more than a pack of wild horses 
pullin' your wagon to keep you from me 
It would take more than superior forces 
even a dragon to keep you from me 

You can make fools out of other good guessers  
put me in blinkers, I know where you'd be (Hi yup!) 
It would take schools of the finest professors 
usin' their thinkers to keep you from me 

What a sight you are, how bright you are, you glow  
take that sight away and right away I'd go (Hi yup!) 
straight to your door over obstacle courses  
maybe I'm braggin' but surely you'll see 

It would take more than a pack of wild horses 
pullin' your wagon to keep you from me 

nothin' could keep you from me! 

(Hi yup! Hi yup! Hi yup!) 

(Hi yup!) 

[repeat all]

...nothin' could keep you  
from me! 

(Hi yup!)
