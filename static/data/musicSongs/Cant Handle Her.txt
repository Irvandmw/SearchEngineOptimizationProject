Lyrics:


Hook me up, 4
Ooh, girl you got a goddamn
Oh, goddamn, hold on
Oh shit, oh

Ooh, you gon' fuck around get me in trouble
Ooh, I'ma fuck around tell her I love her
Ooh, she know how to talk to me, know how to touch me
Only reason I ain't fell in love with her, I'm so in love with the money

She think that she know what to do to me
She say that she know what to do to me
She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me
She think that she know what to do to me
She say that she know what to do to me
She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me

Woo, can't even lie, Baby the truth
Look at the way that she standin'
Watch how she pose for the camera
Check out the way that she dancin'
A lot of these hoes, they can't stand her
She got me watchin', I can't even stop it
I'm falling in love with the way that she pop it
She told me sit back while she eat up that chocolate
What you tryna do to me?
Bring up them hoes, she gon' say switch the topic
"What that gotta do with me?"
You gotta chill, girl, that head is amazin'
She told me, "Shut up, take that head like a gangsta"
That head made me jump out the bed, I can't take it
I had to embrace it, lil' mama my favorite
I'ma fuck around, tell her I love her
Let me get back on my pimpin'
Got me braggin' 'bout her to my brothers
Boy, this shit here got me trippin'

She think that she know what to do to me
She say that she know what to do to me
She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me
She think that she know what to do to me
She say that she know what to do to me
She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me
She think that she know what to do to me
She say that she know what to do to me
She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me

Promise you you couldn't handle her
It'll fuck up your head, it'll make you go crazy
Eating her pussy, treat you like a rookie
Falling in love, tryna give her a baby
When it come to that head, she the greatest
That shit ridiculous, ain't no competition
As soon as she see me, she say, "Let me taste it"
I don't know how to respond
All of my bitches, they know I got bitches
And all of 'em know how I kick it
Don't even open your mouth with no gossip
When you around me, don't bring up other niggas, uh
That ain't the way I was raised, come let me introduce you to this pimpin'
I can't admit it, I'm stuck in my ways
I know the game and I won't be a victim
I learned this shit from my uncle
I learned this shit from my brother
She gon' make me break the code
Fuck around, get me in trouble

Ooh, you gon' fuck around get me in trouble
Ooh, I'ma fuck around tell her I love her
Ooh, she know how to talk to me, know how to touch me
Only reason I ain't fell in love with her, I'm so in love with the money

She think that she know what to do to me
She say that she know what to do to me
She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me
She think that she know what to do to me
She say that she know what to do to me
She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me
