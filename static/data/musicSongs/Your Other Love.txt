Lyrics:


Your other love may be handsome 
And when he smiles he's got a twinkle in his eye 
Your other love may be bolder 
And when he holds you in his arms you wanna die 
He says he loves you from the very start 
But your other love, but your other love 
Is gonna someday break your heart. 

Your other love says he needs you 
Just like a flower needs the burning summer sun 
Your other love says he wants you 
Oh, how he swears to you 
That you're the only one 
He claims his future just depends on you 
But your other love, but your other love 
Is gonna someday prove untrue 

He's just tellin' lies 
Got you hypnotized 
Soon you'll realize. 

Your other love is unfaithful
When you're not there, another girl is in his arms
Your other love is a lover
Makin' love to any girl who's in his arms
My love is true
Not for just a day
But your other love
But your other love
Is gonna someday fly away
But your other love
But your other love
Is gonna someday fly away
