Lyrics:


I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
In a little place called Hamburger Den
I heard that old jukebox start playin'
A tune called the truck drivin' man

The waitress then brought me some coffee
I thanked her then called her again
I said that old song sure does fit me
'Cause I'm a truck drivin' man

Well pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox
And play the truck drivin' man

I climbed back aboard my old Semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a movin'
Now I'm on my way to San Antone

When I get my call up to glory
They'll take me away from this land
I'll head this old truck up to heaven
'Cause I'm a Truck Drivin Man

Well Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox
And play the truck drivin' man
