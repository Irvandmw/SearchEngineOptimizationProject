Lyrics:


We've got our problems
They're not so bad
Sticky situations always stop us from moving ahead
Just a civil feeling... and it feels so right
Where's the need for this indecision?
I don't really want to fight

Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

I know nothing is perfect
I see the doubt in your eyes
You're asking me so many questions
I pray that you realize
You don't the meaning
And it hurts me to say
In these games where we hide our feelings
Our problems remain the same

Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

Show a little mercy on me
Show a little mercy on me
