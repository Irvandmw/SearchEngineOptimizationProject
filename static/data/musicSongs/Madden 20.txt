Are you ready for some football?
Ladies and gentlemen
Yeah, haha, uhh
(Crazy)

Down in Mississippi and New Orleans
Big Snoop Dogg got a mad new league
The team is off the hook and you don't really want none
But if you do, come and get some

See, tell your mama and tell your daddy
Now tell the whole damn world this is Madden territory
Tell your mama and tell your daddy
Now tell the whole damn world this is Madden territory
Come and get some if you want some
But you ain't bad enough
So you can't take none on big Snoop Dogg
And I'm the only one
And when it comes to Madden
All ya'll fools my sons, haha

Back up off me and watch you lose
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I'm giving Madden boom
And if you choose to run up on me, you gon' laid down so fast
'Cause I can get you with the run or I can hit you with the pass
(Hey, go home)

I can't be touched and I can't be steamed
Roll your ass up, when I'm in a mud, leave!
Too old, too old, Madden time for you suckas
We all can't get close, so why you wanna touch us?
Cause my team is so hard, my team is legit
Madden 20, Snoop Dogg is this shit, now get it
(Hey, go home)

I got cleats on my feet, jersey on my back
Helmet on my hair, ready to attack like that

Down in Mississippi and New Orleans
Big Snoop Dogg got a mad new league
The team is off the hook and you don't really want none
But if you do, come and get some

See, tell your mama and tell your daddy
Now tell the whole damn world this is Madden territory
Tell your mama and tell your daddy
Now tell the whole damn world this is Madden territory
Come and get some if you want some
But you ain't bad enough
So you can take none
I'm big Snoop Dogg
And I'm the only one
And when it comes to Madden
All ya'll fools my sons, haha

Back up off me and watch you lose
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I'm giving Madden boom
And if you choose to run up on me, you gon' laid down so fast
'Cause I can get you with the run or I can hit you with the pass
(Hey, go home)
(You're crazy)

I can't be touched and I can't be steamed
Roll your ass up, when I'm in a mud, leave!
Too old, too old, Madden time for you suckas
We all can't get close, so why you wanna touch us?
Cause my team is so hard, my team is legit
Madden 20, Snoop Dogg is this shit, now get it

(Hey, go home) (Come on)
(You're crazy)
Go, go, go, go (crazy)
Big Snoop Dogg, is in the game
