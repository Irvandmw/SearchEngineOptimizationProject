Lyrics:


Trust me
Thereâs no need to fear
Everyoneâs here
Waiting for you to finally be one of us

Come down...
You may be full of fear
But youâll be safe here
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

I will let you down
Iâll let you down, Iâll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

Trust me
Iâll be there when you need me
Youâll be safe here
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

I will let you down
Iâll let you down, Iâll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

I will let you down
Iâll let you down, Iâll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

Never want to come down
Never want to come down
Never want to come down

(Down, let you down)

I will let you down
Iâll let you down, Iâll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

I will let you down
Iâll let you down, Iâll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me
