Lyrics:


Many times, my mind is wrapped up in troubles
And my heart gets so heavy too
Sometimes when I sink so low I touch bottom
I kneel down to reach up and He pulls me through

I pray my way out of trouble
And I ask my dear Lord to help me each day
I pray my way out of trouble
And the dear nail-scarred hand wipes my teardrops away

The smallest prayer from the world's biggest sinner
Brings a smile to His saddened face
So I just go to Him any time I am in trouble
Wash my heart in the waters of my Savior's grace

I pray my way out of trouble
And I ask my dear Lord to help me each day
I pray my way out of trouble
And the dear nail-scarred hand wipes my teardrops away

I pray my way out of trouble
And I ask my dear Lord to help me each day
I pray my way out of trouble
And the dear nail-scarred hand wipes my teardrops away
