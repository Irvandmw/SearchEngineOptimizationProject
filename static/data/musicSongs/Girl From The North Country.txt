Lyrics:


[Bob Dylan:]
If you're travelin' to the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

[Johnny Cash:]
See for me that her hair's hangin' down
It curls and falls all down her breast
See for me that her hair's hangin' down
That's the way I remember her best

[Bob Dylan:]
If you go when the snowflakes fall
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

[Johnny Cash (Bob Dylan):]
If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Please say hello (Remember me) to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

A true love of mine
(A true love of mine)
A true love of mine
(A true love of mine)
A true love of mine
(A true love of mine)
She once was a true love of mine
