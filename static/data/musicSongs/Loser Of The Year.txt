Lyrics:


Thereâs a lot of talk about me,
People lining up to meet me.
Iâm on a verge of celebrity,
So what you think about that?

Iâve got friends in high places,
Louis Vuitton suitcases,
Look at all their pretty faces
So what you think about that?

So why do I feel like itâs all just a show?

You make me wanna shut it all down,
Throw it all away,
Cause Iâm nothing if I donât have you.

Whatâs the point of being on top,
All the money in the world,
If I canât blow it all on on you.

So, send the cars back,
Put the house on the market,
And my big dreams too.

Because itâs all so clear,
Now without you here,
Iâm the loser of the year.

Iâm at a party in a mansion
Thereâs a lot of high fashion,
And Iâm cooler than Iâve ever been
So what you think about that?

Iâm livinâ life in a fast lane
Iâve got fridge full of champagne,
And Iâm hanging out with Lilâ Wayne.
So what you think about that?

So why do I feel like itâs all just a show?

You make me wanna shut it all down,
Throw it all away,
Cause Iâm nothing if I donât have you.

Whatâs the point of being on top,
All the money in the world,
If I canât blow it all on you.

So, send the cars back,
Put the house on the market,
And my big dreams too.

Because itâs all so clear,
That without you here,
Iâm the loser of the year.
Iâm the loser of the year.

I can try real hard,
I can try to pretend,
That all these dreams make any sense
Without you.
But that just ainât true

I thought these things would make me forget
About you and me
But youâre stuck in my head
Iâm a loser,
If I lose her.

You make me wanna shut it all down,
Throw it all away,
Cause Iâm nothing if I donât have you.

Whatâs the point of being on top,
All the money in the world,
If I canât blow it all on you.

You make me wanna shut it all down,
Throw it all away,
'cause I'm nothing if I donât have you.

So, send the cars back,
Put the house on the market,
And my big dreams too.

Because itâs all so clear,
That I need you near,
And itâs all so clear,
Now without you here,
Iâm the loser of the year.

Loser of the year.
Iâm the loser of the year.
Loser of the year.
