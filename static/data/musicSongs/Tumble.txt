I don't know where I'm going, I don't know how I'll get there
But I'll just keep on going and hope there's something waiting for me

It's Sunday afternoon and I hope I'll get there soon yeah
Cause I'm just kind of tired of not knowing where I'm gonna be soon

Can you show me? Give me just a sign? Show me I am right where I belong!

And so I'll tumble back to where I came from,
That's where I first found love and I'm not gonna run, run away no more
Yes I'll tumble, back to where I came from,
That's where I first found love and I'm not gonna run, run away no more

I guess I'm back again yea, the circles never end,
Tell me you'll be true to me you'll never ever want to be mean

I'm sorry I'm pushing you, but look what you put me through
I just couldn't take it, promise me you'll be good

And show me? Give me just a sign? Show me I am right where I belong!

And so I'll tumble back to where I came from,
That's where I first found love and I'm not gonna run, run away no more
Yes I'll tumble, back to where I came from,
That's where I first found love and I'm not gonna run, run away no more

Never will I understand it why we start to fuss and fight,
Never will I comprehend it whether it is right for,
I gotta make my mind up, can't seem to get along
Yet we know its been way to way to long,
You know it's true, I can't stop loving you

And so I'll tumble back to where I came from,
That's where I first found my love and I'm not gonna run, run away no more
Yes I'll tumble, back to where I came from,
That's where I first found my love and I'm not gonna run, run away no more
