Lyrics:


We the hottest niggas, no discussion
Fuck them niggas, I don't owe 'em nothing
They say they got it but I know they bluffing
Come here baby, come and show me something
Give me head, make it wet and sloppy
I promise baby I won't tell nobody
Fuck what them other hoes said about me
If you love me baby you should never doubt me
Now give me that groupie love
Now I need that groupie love
Now give me that groupie love
Come here and give me that groupie love
Just give me that groupie love
I come to your city just give me that groupie love
Don

No pillow talking with these hoes, groupie bitch play your role
I'm doing 80 through the toll, I hit up Vegas in a Rolls
I like strippers with they body done
I need a blowjob, I'm 'bout to hire one
She said she like all my songs
Well can you come give me some head while I'm writin' one?
I need a mami, a fire one
I'm taking these pills 'til my body numb
Slow-mo, I can't move
Hardly parked the new Rari at the pool party
Me and Artist going hop out it
Pull up on the curb, sitting lopsided
Talking fly you better not stop it
Balmain, my whole block got it
I get that work and I serve it
Hop in that toy and I swerve it
Maybach with the curtains
I'm laid back in my Birkin
I met a bitch out in Florida, but she said she live in Georgia
I was Louis down when I saw her
Had another one right before her
Say my name put some respeck on it
I'm certified, put a check on it
I come to your strip just to flex on it
Saint Laurent when I step on it
You and your friend, y'all are both mine
I got white bitches doing coke lines
Ten chains, you would go blind
Switching lanes, I got no time

We the hottest niggas, no discussion
Fuck them niggas, I don't owe 'em nothing
They say they got it but I know they bluffing
Come here baby, come and show me something
Give me head, make it wet and sloppy
I promise baby I won't tell nobody
Fuck what them other hoes said about me
If you love me baby you should never doubt me
Now give me that groupie love
Now I need that groupie love
Now give me that groupie love
Come here and give me that groupie love
Just give me that groupie love
I come to your city just give me that groupie love

Hit ATL, they think T.I.P there, Hit MIA, they think Rick there
20K for the wristwear, do the Yeezys then I switch pairs
Like woah, I do the dance on em
I fuck her then I put my mans on her
Strip club, throwin' bands on her
I throw that money just to stand on it
Wait, fuck all the hype
She coming to fuck then I'm boarding to flight
Ain't no difference all these hoes is alike
Pour a four in a Sprite then I call it a night
Wait, big kilo make my neck hurt
I got a rottweiler on my sweatshirt
I don't even got a text first
She gon' dive in the bed headfirst
They rush the door when we coming out it
I be drunk as fuck, I just stumble out it
Looking like a couple hundred thousand
I ain't never ever have no love for cowards
Niggas know me and the bitches on me
Doing autographs, just titties only
VIP, my hitters only
Bring that ass here and come sit it on me

We the hottest niggas, no discussion
Fuck them niggas, I don't owe 'em nothing
They say they got it but I know they bluffing
Come here baby, come and show me something
Give me head, make it wet and sloppy
I promise baby I won't tell nobody
Fuck what them other hoes said about me
If you love me baby you should never doubt me
Now give me that groupie love
Now I need that groupie love
Now give me that groupie love
Come here and give me that groupie love
Just give me that groupie love
I come to your city just give me that groupie love
