Lyrics:


I once heard that if your dreams don't scare you
You're not dreaming big enough
Save your pennies for a rainy day?
What if the rain never comes?

And if it pours, just let it pour down from the sky
Cause we weren't born to run
We can never second count
Cause we're the young, brave hearted ones

And we can leave our story like nothing ever told
Until we taste our glory, we'll bare our skin and bones
This is our territory, it's all we've ever known
We're right where we belong
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)

When seasons change and "maybe's" turn to "never's"
You learn that nothing lasts
Looking ahead, it seems like life will last forever
But time, it moves so fast

You can dream or you can wish upon a star
And toss your coins into a well
Or you can stare down all your fears right in their eyes
Leaving an echo that will yell

Belong, oh-ooh-oh-oh
We're right where we belong

When was the last time you did something for the first time?
When was the first time you did something for the last time?
Let's find a million things that we could do the first time
You never know-oh, this could be the last time

And we can leave our story like nothing ever told
Until we taste our glory, we'll bare our skin and bones
This is our territory, it's all we've ever known
We're right where we belong
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)

Belong, oh-ooh-oh-oh
We're right where we belong
Belong, oh-ooh-oh-oh
We're right where we belong
