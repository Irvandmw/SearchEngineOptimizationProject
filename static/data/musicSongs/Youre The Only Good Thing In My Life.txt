Lyrics:


You only fuck for love
Told me you could never get enough
Posing as a Playboy centerfold
You could be my Penthouse Pet, I know

You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off
Everything is wrong but it's all right
Everything is wrong but it's all right
You're the only good thing in my life

Do what your heart desires
Love is always strange when it just starts
You didn't have a care left in the world
Naked, tanning by the swimming pool

You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off
Everything is wrong but it's all right
Everything is wrong but it's all right
You're the only good thing in my life

Layin' in the sun
Never need to tell me when you come
'Cause you know that I can just feel it
