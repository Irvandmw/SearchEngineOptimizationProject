Lyrics:


I remember me wide awake on Christmas eve
Waiting for the sun to reach the sky
Life was beautiful, anything was possible
Never knew the meaning of goodbye

Things were oh so simple
I prayed that it would never end

And our love lives in every memory
The sweetest days never fade away
And when I need to feel them close to me
I think of Christmas mornings and how it used to be

I still remember when you were maybe 9 or 10
Afraid of shadows on your wall
I would hold you tight

Tell you everything's alright
I'm just a few steps down the hall

Things were oh so simple then
What I'd give to live it all again

But our love lives in every memory
The sweetest days never fade away
And when I need to feel them close to me
I think of Christmas mornings and how it used to be

Yes our love lives in every memory
The sweetest days never fade away
And when I need to feel them close to me
I think of Christmas mornings and how it used to be

I think of Christmas mornings and how it still can be...
