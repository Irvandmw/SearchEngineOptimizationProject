Lyrics:


[50 Cent - Chorus]
All we do is bullshit and party then bullshit some more
All we do is bullshit then party around the globe on world tour
Thatâs that bullshit, letâs party
Thatâs that bullshit, letâs party

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
Look bitch its 50, you know its hot
number one on the billboard spot
You must be high saying itâs not
You must be drunk, you must be drunk
I got Guetta going ghetto now
I suggest you donât fuck around
Everybody know how I get down, you know how I get down

[50 Cent - Chorus]
All we do is bullshit and party then bullshit some more
All we do is bullshit then party around the globe on world tour
Thatâs that bullshit, letâs party
Thatâs that bullshit, letâs party

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
Man I get the club jumping, yea itâs nothing
I do this all the time
Now bartender bring 10 bottles Iâm ballinâ out of my mind
Wait the bitches on me, bitch get off me
You fucking up the floâ you got the go
Donât trip, donât trip, this that certified rich nigga shit

Sound like a tech over techno (Itâs on)
From New York its sexual (Itâs on)
Give it yo you from the get go (Itâs on)
Every position (Itâs on)
Girl slow it down, matter of fact turn around
Back it up, break it down, you know how we get down

[50 Cent - Chorus]
All we do is bullshit and party then bullshit some more
All we do is bullshit then party around the globe on world tour
Thatâs that bullshit, letâs party
Thatâs that bullshit, letâs party

[50 Cent - Verse 3]
Till the sun come up, till we all fucked up, till the Champagne gone
This is celebration, till the music stop, and the lights come on
Till everybody gone, whereâs everybody gone to?
To my house, itâs the after party, better grab somebody
Come and move your body, now letâs make a toast
To success, youâre my guest Iâm your host, 50

Sound like a tech over techno (Itâs on)
From New York its sexual (Itâs on)
Give it yo you from the get go (Itâs on)
Every position (Itâs on)
Girl slow it down, matter of fact turn around
Back it up, break it down, you know how we get down

[50 Cent - Chorus X2]
All we do is bullshit and party then bullshit some more
All we do is bullshit and party run the globe on world tour
Thatâs that bullshit, letâs party
Thatâs that bullshit, letâs party
