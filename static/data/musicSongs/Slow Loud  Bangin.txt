Lyrics:


[Hook:]
Slow loud and bangin'
I turn my speakers up
And then I just start swanging
Sometimes I get behind the wheel
Then I start to steer
Don't know where I'm going but just get me out of here
Slow loud and bangin'
I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing
See baby I'm just trying to live
And I got stress for real
So I drop the topper 'cause how will that make me feel

[Verse 1:]
Drop the top and then you know the drill
Hit the strips so I can show the wheels
People say that I'm over trouble
But when they talk about me they promote and steal
They told me real to recognize the real
But if you real then you should know Chamille
If you don't then you should get a coke
Because a cold shoulder that it's the cola feel
Wooden rippen written on my plates
This type of weapon is in normal ways
But I can see you ain't got a clue
So be a good detective and get on the case
You can sit on that couch at home
And not reach success and then call it fate
'Cause y'all the type that applies the brakes
But know that I'm the type that ain't trying to wait

[Hook:]
Slow loud and bangin'
I turn my speakers up
And then I just start swanging
Sometimes I get behind the wheel
Then I start to steer
Don't know where I'm going but just get me out of here
Slow loud and bangin'
I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing
See baby I'm just trying to live
And I got stress for real
So I drop the topper 'cause how will that make me feel

[Verse 2:]
Money don't make you bullet proof of stress
You can get sued mess around and lose your vest
Get your heart broken and it bruise your chest
Peace won't guarantee the roogie's rest
Your good girl trying to find who to sex
While you try to figure what dude is next
Someday you gotta give bad news to press
But even winners gotta find new success
Meditate ain't a spare to wait
Next stop on the map is a better day
Pretend that the towers was never break
But the past's in the past so just let it chain
The passengers out with your head to lay
When I'm in the route till the getaway
The truth remain with you so be scared to say
When I turn the beat up and I let it play and say

[Hook:]
Slow loud and bangin'
I turn my speakers up
And then I just start to swanging
Sometimes I get behind the wheel
Then I start to steer
Don't know where I'm going but just get me out of here
Slow loud and bangin'
I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing
See baby I'm just trying to live
And I got stress for real
So I drop the topper 'cause how will that make me feel

[Verse 3:]
Seem like this world so drop as cruel
Good parents don't give proper duos
What the hell happened to Dr. Seuss
And who taught these little kids how to cock a shoe
Turn 13 and get shot for shoes
Turn 15 and get shot in school
Get too upset when I watch the news
So I just hit the strip in the drop topper cruise
Please Lord don't fail me now
This partnership's a cooperation
I'm on the job and know who to bust
And make living longer my occupation
They always told me their money talks
I always loved a good conversation
But they ain't seein' who behind the wheel
So let's drop the top so they not mistaken

Slow loud and bangin'
Amazing
Down against the wheel 'cause it always makes me feel
Down against the wheel 'cause it always makes me feel alright
Slow loud and bangin'
Slow loud and bangin'
Slow loud and bangin'
