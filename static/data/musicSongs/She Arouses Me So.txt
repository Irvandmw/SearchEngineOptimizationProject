Lyrics:


Well it's 2 oh 1 and she's saying she's done
but I need another go, coz she arouses me so
She arouses me so
Yeah it's 3 oh 4 and we're lying on the floor
but I need another go, coz she arouses me so
She arouses me so, she arouses me so

What's the point of sleepin'
instead of keepin'
doin' it anyhow?
Forget about tomorrow,
until tomorrow
let's stay here and now

Yeah it's 4 - 19 and it doesn't seem keen
but she needs another go
and she arouses me so
she arouses me so

do do dit dit 
do do dit dit [etc.]

what's the point of sleepin'
instead of keepin'
doin' it anyhow?
Forget about tomorrow,
until tomorrow
let's stay here and now

Yeah it's 6 oh 8 and we're already late
but we need another go
and she arouses me so
she arouses me so

she arouses me so

she arouses me so oh oh oh oh oh oh

she arouses me so

she arouses
really arouses
she arouses

yeah she arouses me so
