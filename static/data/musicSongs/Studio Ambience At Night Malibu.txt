Chattering

Feel it when I murder, so much further
I could go and so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
I say oh my

I feel the Arian in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water now I'm prayin' for a flood
Feel like time passing me by, slower than a slug
While this feelin' inside of my body's feelin' like a rug
You can hug me, rub me on the back like a child
Tell me you love me, need me, promise me you'll never leave me

Wait a minute, is that-?
Ayy, who's all in there? You playin' that?
6ix you can't be playin' that, that's the album shit, dawg!
