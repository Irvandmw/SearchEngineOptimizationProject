Justin Bieber

Damn damn JB, where the hell you been
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds
2 big face Rollies, no I ain't lyin'
Making momma so proud that she cryin'

Yeah you say I'm crazy? Guess that makes two
But I never knew that dreams really came true
Started playing drums when I was only 2
Now we kick it in Japan, kung-fu

So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating
I swear Otis Redding
Will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money

Riding in an all-black Benz with the all black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses

Wait, I'm not done
Wait, wait

I thanked Jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris I'm saving you by the bell
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves an imperfect person
Perfectly personally I think she is perfectly perfect

I get it done abundantly
She wants to get up under me
I swear that I got a hun' of these
'Cause baby I'm a money tree

So be my little honey, be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y

Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag's impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually
Get out your mind literally
There's a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out

I should make history
I am like a mystery
Hated by jealousy 'cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory

Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time
Playing with the camera claiming that "It's not mine"

Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry, you look good
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses
Yeah without them I'd be blurry
