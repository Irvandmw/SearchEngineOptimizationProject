Lyrics:


Bless them, it's the DJ, make the music play
Make the gyal them swing... everyday
Make them sing

Even if I know it's wrong
Hope the DJ plays our song
So you can find me
And dance behind me (down the line)
You love how I dip and wine
With you it happens everytime
My body is lonely, for you only

Something about you got me sweatin', sweatin'
Baby, ya ma driving loco, loco
Now you got my body shakin', shakin' (Â¡eh!)
I wanna dance with you all night

Hey DJ
PÃ³ngale la mÃºsica que le gusta
Una para que se mueva y se luzca
Y baile conmigo, sÃ³lo conmigo, Â¡hey!

Hey DJ
DJ turn it up
C'mon play the music I know she likes it
Gotta see her moving, I gotta keep dancing
Only with me, and only with me, yeah, eh (turn it up, turn it up)

I give you what you want, you want, you want
But you gon' fall in love, in love, in love
So tell me what you want, you want, you want
'Cause you got fall for me, baby (rewind)

Ponme el reggaeton, pero full
Pa' pasarla cool
Hay muchas en la discoteca
Pero sÃ³lo me gustas tÃº, solamente tÃº
Yo me imagino en la playa, contigo en un cielo azul

Sobre la arena, tu piel canela
Entramos en calor
Vale la pena, contigo nena (bam, bam, bam)
Se pasa mejor

Something about you got me sweatin', sweatin'
Baby, ya ma driving loco, loco (do it girl)
Now you got my body shakin', shakin' (Â¡eh!)
I wanna dance with you all night (how you mean?)

Hey DJ
PÃ³ngale la mÃºsica que le gusta
Una para que se mueva y se luzca
Y baile conmigo, sÃ³lo conmigo, Â¡hey! (DJ turn it up)

Hey DJ
C'mon play the music I know she likes it
Gotta see her moving, I gotta keep dancing
Only with me, and only with me, yeah, eh

Well you know what she tell me say
There ain't no place she'd rather be
She dash away the press and the media all top celebrity
Only me give the gyal love properly
Only me give the gyal loving endlessly
Me give her all me energy
So Mr DJ turn up the sound
Make she move her body
Only me give the gyal love properly
Only me give the gyal loving endlessly

Hey DJ
PÃ³ngale la mÃºsica que le gusta
Una para que se mueva y se luzca
Y baile conmigo, sÃ³lo conmigo, Â¡hey!

Hey DJ
C'mon play the music I know she likes it
Gotta see her moving, I gotta keep dancing
Only with me, and only with me, yeah, eh (DJ turn it up)

Only with me, ah-ha
Â¡Eh!
