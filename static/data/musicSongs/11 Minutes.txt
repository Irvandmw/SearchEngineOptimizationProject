Lyrics:


[Halsey:]
I'm eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?

[Halsey & YUNGBLUD:]
I think I missed you calling on the other line
I'm just thinking all these thoughts up in my mind
Talking love but I can't even read the signs
I would sell my soul for a bit more time
You stain all on my body like you're red wine
You're the fucking acid to my alkaline
You run your middle finger up and down my spine
I'm sorry there was no one to apologize
I'm so fucking sorry, I'm so fucking sorry
I've been playing somebody and it's helping nobody
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't stick
And now I'm sick, throwing fits
And yeah, I've seen you in my head every fucking day since I left
You on the floor with your hands 'round your head
And I'm down and depressed
All I want is your head on my chest
Touching feet in my bed

[Halsey:]
I'm eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?
[YUNGBLUD:]
You're eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?

[Halsey:]
Tell me what you need
I can make you more than what you are
Come and lay the roses on the floor
Every single Sunday, don't get bored
I just want to freeze
I can give you more than what you are
Now I see you standing all alone
I never thought the world would turn to stone

[Refrain: Halsey & YUNGBLUD]
So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fucking with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fucking with my head

[Halsey:]
I'm eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?
[YUNGBLUD:]
(Why aren't you here?)
You're eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?
(Why aren't you here?)

[YUNGBLUD:]
So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fucking with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fucking with my head

[Halsey:]
You're eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
So why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
