Lyrics:


I wish I was a pirate shipwrecked down in Mexico
Where the oceans turn to silver and the beaches turn to gold
I'd make love to some senorita in that town
I'd get on my boat and I'd sail the ocean round

I wish I was a pirate out there under my own flag
Running for no reason and no reason to turn back
The salt and rum on my tongue, sails tattered and torn
Laughing in the devil's face, riding out the storm

Ooh, one of these days
Gonna get off of this highway
Wake up in some bay
With the sunshine on my face
Saint Christopher on a silver chain
Say a prayer and sail away

Ooh, one of these days
Gonna get off of this highway
Wake up in some bay
With the sunshine on my face
Saint Christopher on a silver chain
Say a prayer and sail away

I wish I was pirate on some ghost ship in the night
With nothing but the stars, the moon and faith to be my guide
Steady as she goes with my back to the wind
Then in a cloud of cannon smoke out, I disappear again
