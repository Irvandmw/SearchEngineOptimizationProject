Lyrics:


I can see all night you've been on split stones
Trying to make it so we could play loud
Picking at our souls like we didn't notice
Like we were only playing with the sound

Trying to control what was so low, but
I never knew how then to just go and let it out
Let it out

But if you could fight, if you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry, if you couldn't sleep it off
If you could feel everything you've ever caused
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose

And I'm not saying I would always speak up
That it didn't creep up on me all the time
I'm just saying there was a window
Where you could've let go in that place and time

Laughing all it off like it was innocent, oh
All I ever wanted was to get rid of it and let it out
Let it out

But if you could fight, if you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry, if you couldn't sleep it off
If you could feel everything you've ever caused
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose

And I could see us there, you staring at me
And me just praying for it
I could see us there, standing cheek to cheek
And counting week by week
Wishing everything would be clear
I could see us there
I could see us there

But if you could fight, if you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry, if you couldn't sleep it off
If you could feel everything you've ever caused
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
