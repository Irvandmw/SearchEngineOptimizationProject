Lyrics:


Mmm, yeah, yuh
I thought you into my life, whoa
Look at my mind, yeah
No better place or a time
How they align
Universe must have my back
Fell from the sky into my lap
And I know you know that you're my soulmate and all that
I'm like ooh, ooh
My whole life got me ready for you, ooh
Got me happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy, yeah
I'ma be happy, happy
Won't get no crying from me, yeah
Gonna be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy, yeah
Gonna be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy, yeah
Gonna be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
