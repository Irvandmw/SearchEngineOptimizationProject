Lyrics:


Oh oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh oh,
Oh,
Yeah,

You had me waitin even on the second date,
I picked you up I took you to your favorite place,
I saw you flirtin but I looked the other way,
Away, away, away, hey,

You pulled me up and said you had a place to go,
Just grabbed my keys, you took my car and stole my phone,
I know I shouldnt but I let you get away,
Away, away, away,

But Im not a player,
Im not a clown,
I wont be a puppet,
Just hangin around,
You need another man to put diamonds on your hands,
And let you take his car,
I found out who you are,
I finally figured you out,

Oh no,
I should've seen it comin you were just pretend,
You just took my credit card and maxed it til the end,
I wish Id known before I hit the ATM,
Oh no,
It happened again,
(Oh yeah)

Im not a player,
Im not a clown,
I wont be a puppet,
Just hangin around,
You need another man to put diamonds on your hands,
And let you take his car,
I found out who you are,
I finally figured (I figured you out),
I finally figured (oh figured you out),
I finally figured (oh yeah) you out,

Im goin away (far, far away),
Im goin away (so far away),
Im goin away (far, far away),
Im gonna pack your bags and kick you out,
Im sorry but I figured you out,
(Figured you out, yeah),
So long, so long,
Farewell,

(Cause) Im not a player,
Im not a clown,
(I wont be) I wont be a puppet,
Just hangin around,
You need another man (diamonds on your hands) to put diamonds on your hands,
And let you take his car,
I found out who you are,

(Im) Im not a player,
Im not a clown,
I wont be a puppet,
Just hangin around,
You need another man to put diamonds on your hands,
And let you take his car,
I found out who you are,
I finally figured (I figured you out),
I finally figured (oh figured you out),
I finally figured (oh yeah), you out.
