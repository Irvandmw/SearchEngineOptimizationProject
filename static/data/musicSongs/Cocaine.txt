Lyrics:


If you wanna hang out you've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you wanna get down, down on the ground
Cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine

If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues
Cocaine
When your day is done and you wanna run
Cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine

If your day is gone and you wanna ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back
Cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine
