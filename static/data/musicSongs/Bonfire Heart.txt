Lyrics:


Your mouth is a revolver
Firing bullets in the sky
Your love is like a soldier,
Loyal 'til you die
And Iâve been looking at the stars
For a long, long time
Iâve been putting out fires
All my life

Everybody wants a flame,
They donât want to get burnt
And today is our turn

Days like these lead to...
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours.
You light the spark in my bonfire heart.
People like usâwe donât
Need that much, just some-
One that starts,
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

This world is getting colder.
Strangers passing by
No one offers you a shoulder.
No one looks you in the eye.
But Iâve been looking at you
For a long, long time
Just trying to break through,
Trying to make you mine

Everybody wants a flame,
They donât want to get burnt
Well, today is our turn

Days like these lead to...
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours.
You light the spark in my bonfire heart.
People like usâwe donât
Need that much, just some-
One that starts,
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

Our bonfire hearts
Our bonfire hearts
Our bonfire hearts
You light the spark

People like usâwe donât
Need that much, just some-
One that starts,
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

Days like these lead to...
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours.
You light the spark in my bonfire heart.
People like usâwe donât
Need that much, just some-
One that starts,
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

(Our bonfire hearts)

(Days like these lead to...
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours.
You light the spark in my bonfire heart.*)
People like usâwe donât
Need that much, just some-
One that starts,
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
