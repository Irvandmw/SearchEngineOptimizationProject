Lyrics:


When my heart doesn't beat anymore
And my body's cold
You will walk, dressed in black, to my door
And the bells will toll

You use my love like an open vein
Just when I thought it would heal
Back you came

Seeing you again for the first time
Tryna look ahead and not behind
Raging as you do against the tide
Knowing that you're his instead of mine
Getting used to being hurt again
Every day's closer to the end
Holding back the tears I need to cry
Waiting to breathe for the last time
Yeah, that's how it feels to be alive
That's how it feels to be alive

At my grave, they did say one last verse
'Bout the new love that you found
And I lay in the rain by the church
And they lured me into the ground

You stole my heart as your souvenir
Thought that you would never come back
But now you're here

Seeing you again for the first time
Tryna look ahead and not behind
Raging as you do against the tide
Knowing that you're his instead of mine
Getting used to being hurt again
Every day's closer to the end
Holding back the tears I need to cry
Waiting to breathe for the last time
Yeah, that's how it feels to be alive
Yeah, that's how it feels to be alive
Yeah, that's how it feels to be alive

(Outside waiting in the cold again)
(I'm outside waiting to be held again)
Yeah, that's how it feels to be alive
(Outside standing on my own again)
That's how it feels to be alive
