Lyrics:


Alright, you caught me, I don't play a good guitar
But what do you want from me, it's just a stupid bar
I didn't promise anything, no

You think I'm pretty and you like the way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk
So, I think we're gonna get along

I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair come down and make you look older
How you get that so handsome, my boy?

Pretty baby
Pretty baby

The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now

Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You won't hear no
You won't hear no

Pretty baby
Pretty baby
