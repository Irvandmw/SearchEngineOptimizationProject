Lyrics:


Are you ready?

You call me on the phone
I act like nothings going on
We're drivng in my car
I pretend that you don't turn me on
Ah ah ah  you sexy thing
Yeah you know it yeah
Ah ah ah you move around now you show it

I'm not in love
It's just a phase that i'm going through
I'm always looking for something new
But don't go running away

It's almost 3am
I'm hoping that you don't let go
You're moving in so close
I'm trying not to lose control
Ah ah  ah  you sexy thing
Yeah you know it yeah
Ah ah ah
You move around   now you show it (come on)

I'm not in love
It's just a phase that i'm going through
I'm always looking for something new
Don't go running away
Oh i'm not in love
I try to tell myself all the time
I just can't help how i feel tonight
So don't go running away yeah

Im not in love (yeah yeah)
I'm not in love
I'm not in love (give it to me now)
I'm not in love (break it down)
Ah ah ah you sexy thing
Yeah you know it ah ah ah
You move   around  yeah you show it

[Repeat last verse fading out with chorus]
