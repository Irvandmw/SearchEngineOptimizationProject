Lyrics:


I just talked to a dolphin the other day about things
And he said hey boy, what's your hurry
He said if I was you, I'd rather be me
I guess that's the way it's supposed to be
So don't you worry, no, try to love one an' other

I said take a look around town
Look what ya got to pick from
You got a whole lot of people
Just tryin' to get somethin' from someone, yeah

But then he said you can't start thinkin' like that
Because you know it's not where it's at
You gotta open up your mind
Leave the other world behind

I said it's easier said than done
He said no, no, all you gotta do is love one an' other
Take your time, try to rhyme
Shake the hand of your brother, yeah
And just love one an' other

I said thank you Mr. Dolphin
You're my friend now Mr. Dolphin
Once again now Mr. Dolphin
I said thank you, thank you
Mr. Dolphin, yeah

I said take a look around town
Look what ya got to pick from
You got a whole lot of people
Just tryin' to get somethin' from someone, yeah

But then he said you can't start thinkin' like that
Because you know it's not where it's at
You gotta open up your mind
Leave the other world behind

I'll see you later Mr. Dolphin and thanks again
For savin' my mind from oblivion and then some
He said now don't you thank me 'cause it's up to you
You gotta be as truthful as you can be to you son
Just love one an' other

I said: thank you Mr. Dolphin
You're my friend now Mr. Dolphin
Once again now Mr. Dolphin
I said thank you, thank you
Mr. Dolphin, yeah

I said: thank you Mr. Dolphin
You're my friend now Mr. Dolphin
Once again now Mr. Dolphin
I said thank you, thank you
Mr. Dolphin
