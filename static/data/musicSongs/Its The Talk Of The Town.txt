Lyrics:


I can't show my face, 
Can't go anyplace, 
People stop an' stare, 
It's so hard to bare, 
Everybody knows you left me, 
It's the talk of the town... 

Every time we meet, 
My heart skips a beat, 
We don't stop to speak, 
'Though it's just a week, 
Everybody knows you left me, 
It's the talk of the town... 

We send out invitations, 
To friends and relations, 
Announcing our weddin' day 
Friends and our relations, 
Gave congratulations, 
How can you face them? 
What can you say? 

Let's make up sweetheart, 
We can't stay apart, 
Don't let foolish pride, 
Keep you from my side, 
How can love like ours be ended? 
It's the talk of the town... 

[instrumental repeat of verse]

How can you face them? 
What can you say? 

Let's make up sweetheart, 
We can't stay apart, 
Don't let foolish pride, 
Keep you from my side, 
How can love like ours be ended? 
It's the talk of the town... hmm 

It's the talk of the town.
