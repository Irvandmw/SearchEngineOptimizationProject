Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Through a long and sleepless night I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night of who is to blame
Can't help but wonder if you're lonely too
As I lie there and toss about so at a loss about you

How I wish my heart would leave my memory alone
Why must I re-dream re-live the joys we have known
I pray that someday our love will see the light
'Til then in tick tock silence I'll tell my heart to replay
All through an oh so long and sleepless night

Why must I re-dream re-live the joys we have known
I pray that someday our love will see the light
'Til then in tick tock silence I'll tell my heart to replay
All through an oh so long and sleepless night
