Lyrics:


If we can't be the same old sweethearts
Then we'll just be the same old friends!

For I want someone like you
Just to tell my troubles to
My happiness, on you
It all depends!

For I've known you too long to forget you
And my old dream of love never ends!
Though I know you can't be mine
We will meet from time to time
And we'll just be the same old friends!

For I've known you too long to forget you
And my old dream of love never ends!
Though I know you can't be mine
We will meet from time to time
And we'll just be the same old friends!
