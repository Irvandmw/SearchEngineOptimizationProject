Lyrics:


Skin tight
Fits me like a glove
Your love is
Skin tight
Yes indeed it is
Your love is
Alright
Anytime of day or night
Is alright
Skin tight
Skin tight
Fits me like a glove
Your love is skin tight
Only you can keep me going
All night
Love me till the cows come home
It's alright
Skin tight
Skin tight
Fits me like a glove
Your love is
Skin tight
Yes indeed it is
Your love is
Alright
Any time of day or night
Is alright
Skin tight
