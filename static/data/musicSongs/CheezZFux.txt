Lyrics:


Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin
The butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin

He's trying to say that he's trapped,

He's got gold chains and hairy chest
He's making me sick in his Saturday night best

Shut your mouth, play on bounced
Money could be a...

Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin
The butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin

What is your sign sweetcakes? Have I seen

You somewhere before?
Can I check your tags?

I swear you were made in Heaven!

Disco fever, trampy hoes
El Comino and a confidential

Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin
The butterfly colour,

In the city gone pumpin, pumpin, pumpin, pumpin..

Put on your fatty gold chain,

You're pimpin' and struttin' your stuff
Your walking down the aisle, acting like you're above

Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin'
The butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin'
The butterfly colour

1.. 2.. 3.. STOP!

Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin'
The butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin'
The butterfly colour

Then he saw the most beautiful creature he'd ever seen
That wide brimmed hat, that fake pink fur coat,
And those fishnet stockings

She was just like him, she was just like him,
She was just like him

A PIMP!
