Lyrics:


Yeah
I like them keys
Fucking with them keys

You wouldn't believe this shit baby (waddup)
Feel like I'm going through a crisis (don't let it get to you)
Can't let this shit phase me
Momma tried to save me (she did)
I ain't been asleep in a decade I'm damn near crazy (Gone)
Money is a drug, trying to stay on it long as I can
In my lungs
Had a talk with Messiah everything about the commas (hey Future)
You got the world in your hands
Call it Future baby flow shit some shit by accident (Ew)
Pull strings nigga like sympathy
I'm Astronaut forever
I'm ghetto and I'm clever nigga

On the road to riches
Gods and bitches
Don't let it affect you
The nights and days
Don't let it affect you
Success, yes

I'm sippin' lean, no gasoline
This gon' help my dreams, control my thoughts
Free Lil Boosie, Love is Pain
Fucking with my sanity
Fucking with my family did this shit for my family
It wasn't supposed to be this hards
Shoot up in the park somebody call the ambulance
I fucked around start gambling
I know some niggas would hit your head for half a gram
Sacrificing who I am
I'm a astronaut can't feel my face
I'm ghetto and I'm clever

On the road to riches
Gods and bitches
Don't let it affect you
The nights and days
Don't let it affect you
Success, yes
