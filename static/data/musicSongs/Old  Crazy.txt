Lyrics:


Will you still call me baby when Iâm old and crazy?
When Iâm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think Iâm pretty when my hairâs grey?
Will you still call me baby when Iâm old and crazy?

Will you still hold my hand when my clothes are out of style?
My teeth all ran away and I donât have the same smile

Will you still call me baby when Iâm old and crazy?
When Iâm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think Iâm pretty when my hairâs grey?
Will you still call me baby when Iâm old and crazy?

Will you still wanna dance even if my hips are weak?
My ears donât hear so well and I canât find the beat

Will you still call me baby when Iâm old and crazy?
When Iâm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think Iâm pretty when my hairâs grey?
Will you still call me baby? Will you still call me baby?
Will you still call me baby when Iâm old and crazy?
