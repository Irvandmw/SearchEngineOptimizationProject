Lyrics:


I get by with what I got right here
Do what I can with what I got this year
Watching the time on the clock disappear
Fear is all I got left to fear
I got my enemies among these friends
You got means and baby I got plans
Give me the start and I can find these ends
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again

I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again
I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again

I want peace and all I gotâs this war
I want wings and all I gotâs this floor
I want a shot of what Iâm aiming for
Coming in hot but they blocked this door
So bring me the music for the revolution
Iâm singing for more than just a dead solution
So maybe good living is the best defense
So give me more time I can do it again, again, again

I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again
I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again

What are you waiting for the futureâs here?
What are you waiting for the futureâs here?
What are you waiting for the futureâs here?

I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again
I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again
[x2]

What are you waiting for the futureâs here?
I get by with what I got right here
Fear is all I got left to fear
