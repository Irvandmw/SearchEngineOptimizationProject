Lyrics:


Crazy the things that can turn a blind eye
Out on the street, all the people walk by
Nobody cares who gets pushed aside
As long as it's not gonna fuck with their own lives

Yeah, we're all a little guilty 'bout the vanity
Who we are and who we can't afford to be
Trying so hard to get the attention
Who's looking now is the burning question

Somebody special has a van-stick family
Somebody special took a trip last year
Somebody special drives a Maserati
Everyone's just trying to be somebody
Everyone's just trying to be somebody

Yeah we're all a little stunned by reality
What it is and what it's never going to be
Living everyday redundantly
Sounds like textbook insanity

Somebody special has a van-stick family
Somebody special took a trip last year
Somebody special drives a Maserati
Everyone's just trying to be somebody

Somebody special is a gangster wannabe
Somebody special turned a trick last year
Somebody special loves the paparazzi
Everyone's just trying to be somebody

Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
When nobody cares about each other, how they feel
Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
When nobody cares about each other, how they feel

Somebody special has a van-stick family
Somebody special took a trip last year
Somebody special drives a Maserati
Everyone's just trying to be somebody
Somebody special is a gangster wannabe
Somebody special just lives in fear
Somebody special is in love with molly
Everyone's just trying to be somebody

Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
Is this the new real?
