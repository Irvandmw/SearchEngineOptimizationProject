Lyrics:


Who can make you mad
When you're having a blast
I can, I can

And who can pick you up
When you feelin' like you suck
I can, I can

And who knows what you think
Without you saying anything
I do, I do

Who had you figured out
And never had a doubt
I did, I did

Havenât you heard?
I'm Super girl
You donât wanna mess with me
I got your back
I know your every move
And I got everything you'll ever need

I can make you hang
On every single word
Like this, like this

It could be my vibe
Maybe its my mind
Could be my kiss, could be my kiss

But when I'm around you
Thereâs nothing I can't do
I'm at my best, I'm at my best

Well maybe I'm so good
Cause your standing in the room
You wish, you wish.

Havenât you heard?
I'm Super girl
You don't wanna mess with me
I got your back
I know your every move
And I got everything you'll ever need

I'll take your headache away
I'll give you one another day
I'll be the reason that you live
I'll show you what you've always missed

Havenât you heard?
Iâm Super girl
You don't wanna mess with me
I got your back
I know your every move
And I got everything you'll ever need

I'm Super girl
You don't wanna mess with me
I got your back
I know your every move
And I got everything you'll ever need

I got everything
