Lyrics:


If you want me to prove that I love you baby
Let me tell you what I'll do
I'll climb a mountain and swim a river
Just to get a little kiss from you
Yeah, just to get a little kiss from you

If you want me to prove that I love you baby
Won't you let me tell you please
I'll cross a desert on bread and water
Just a crawlin' on my knees
Yeah, just a crawlin' on my hands and knees

I'll prove to you that my love is true
If you'll only give me just one chance
If you stay with me, where I want you to be
We can have a fine romance

Well, I want you to know that I'll never leave ya
Baby you can count on me
I'll stand beside you and love you forever
'Cause that's the way it's got to be
Yeah you know, that's the way it's go to be

I'll prove to you that my love is true
If you'll only give me just one chance
If you stay with me, where I want you to be
We can have a fine romance

Well, I want you to know that I'll never leave ya
Baby you can count on me
I'll stand beside you and love you forever
'Cause that's the way it's got to be
Yeah you know, that's the way it's go to be
Well, that's the way it's go to be
Mmm, that's the way it's go to be
Yeah you know, that's the way it's go to be
