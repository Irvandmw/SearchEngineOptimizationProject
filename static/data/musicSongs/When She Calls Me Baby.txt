Lyrics:


She'll call me honey
When she needs a helping hand
She might say darlin'
If she needs someone to understand
She'll call me sugar
If she's feelin' kinda sweet
She'll say that I'm crazy
Over my little jealousies 

When she calls me baby
I just reach for the light
I'll hold her like a lady
Thank God she's all mine
With her arms around me
I can leave the world behind
When she calls me baby
I know what's on her mind 

When this life has brought
me to my keees
She's got a way of bringin'
out the man in me 

When she calls me baby
I just reach for the light
I'll hold her like a lady
Thank God she's all mine
With her arms around me
I can leave the world behind
When she calls me baby
I know what's on her mind 

Oh, when she calls me baby
I know what's on her mind
