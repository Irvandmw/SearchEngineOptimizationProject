Lyrics:


Empty your pockets she'll give you all her love
Is that made of diamonds? if not you're gettin' shoved
She'll hold you real tight, squeeze the dollars out of you
Grab your wallet from your pocket and have fun with other dudes

Uhh oh, should've hid all your money
Uhh oh, she took it all from you
Uhh oh, you think I'm being funny
Well, boy, she doesn't really love you

Oh, you will touch the sky
If she told you, to really jump that high
You gave her all your lifelong love just to receive her
Gold diggin' love
Gold diggin' love
Gold diggin' love

You try to confront her on the cash that she spent
She gave you a kiss and that'll pay the rent
How long will you hold on givin' her your life?
Shes killin' you so fast, but with a golden knife

Uhh oh, should've hid all your money
Uhh oh, she took it all from you
Uhh oh, you think I'm being funny
Well, boy, she doesn't really love you

Oh, you will touch the sky
If she told you, to really jump that high
You gave her all your lifelong love just to receive her
Gold diggin' love
Gold diggin' love
Gold diggin' love

Now she's found another men
With more cash she can spend
She's swiped you to the end
Now you're left a broken mess
She left you in her debt
She never broke a sweat

Oh, you will touch the sky
If she told you, to really jump that high
You gave her all your lifelong love just to receive her
Gold diggin' love
Gold diggin' love
Gold diggin' love
Gold diggin' love
Gold diggin' love
Gold diggin' love
