Lyrics:


Thereâs a storm ahead
I see it all round me
I feel it in the air
Shake the ground beneath my feet
And I know itâs all a part of me
Did you make a plan
Just to watch it crumble
Now you see yourself
In a mirror that you cannot clean
And itâs all a part of you
Oh my friend
Look how time has changed
The cracks in our skin
Oh my friend
Let go of the fear thatâs inside your head
So stay strong live on
And chase the midnight sun
When the ceiling falls and thereâs no one watching
We can build again to more than what we
Once could dream
Weâre bigger than we seem

So break off these strings
That tie around you
Take smaller things
To make up something more to see
Make it bigger than it seems
Oh my friend
Look how time has changed
The cracks in our skin
Oh my friend
Let go of the fear thatâs inside your head
So stay strong live on
And chase the midnight sun
When you see yourself
As the darkest shadow
I see you as the light
Oh my friend
Look how time has changed the cracks in our skin
Oh my friend
Look how time has changed
The cracks in our skin
Oh my friend
Let go of the fear thatâs inside your head
So stay strong live on
And chase the midnight sun
