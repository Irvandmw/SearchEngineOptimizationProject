Lyrics:


Do you know that I
Really love you?
Do you know that I
Really want you?
Do you know I feel
I'll never have you?
'Cause I've always hurt
The ones I've loved

So now my mind
Holds back my feelings
Oh yes it does
It's lost all faith
Towards love
But still it feels loves presence all around
That means there's still hope that my love
Will be found

Please won't you tell me
Why I have always hurt
The ones I've loved?
I don't know
Please won't you tell me
Why does this keep me
From your love?
Oh huh
Please can you help me
Restore the faith in myself
Oh ooh
It it you
Who will help me find myself?

Now I
Was not
Expecting love
Now you're here
And I don't know what to do

At times I think
I should open up to you
Then I close up real fast
With the thought of ever really bringing any pain on you
You're so good I wouldn't want to put that kind of strain on you
Just live the life that life brings to you

But yet my heart
Asks
That you stay
It can't bare
To see you leave
It cares not of the yesterdays
It worries not of tomorrows
It only wishes to know of your love
Beyond all sorrows

Ooo hooo
Beyond all tomorrows
Ooooohooo
It only wishes to know of your love
Beyond all sorrows
It only wishes to know of your love
Yeah yeah
Beyond all sorrows
Oooooooooo
Hooooo
Uh Huh
Ooooo
Beyond all our sorrows
Ohh yeah yeah
Oooh oooh ooh
Ooohoouuh
