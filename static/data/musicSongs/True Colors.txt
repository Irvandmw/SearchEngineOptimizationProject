Lyrics:


You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness, inside you
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Like a rainbow

Show me a smile
And don't be unhappy,
Can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Just show your true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Like a rainbow

Such sad eyes
Take courage now
Realize

When this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Just show your true colors
True colors, true colors

There's a shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid just let them show
Your true colors, true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Beautiful, like a rainbow

Show me your colors
Show me your colors
Show me your rainbow
Show me your rainbow
Show me your colors
Show me your rainbow
That's why I love you
Show me your colors
Show me your rainbow
That's why I love you
Show me your colors
Show me your rainbow
