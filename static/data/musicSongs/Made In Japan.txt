Lyrics:


Every avenue in Tokyo is saying that I'm gonna make it,
It's offering the two of us a chance and knows,
Oh, we're gonna take it,
All they need to do is lead us to the floor it'll detonate us,
We'll show 'em what the beat is for to the core, gotta celebrate us

Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!

Fortune and fame suddenly, I can be a real supernova,
(Supernova, supernova)
Shooting star my name in neon lights in the sky before it's over,
Imagine us having fans think of when a-all of them are screamin',
Our fantasy is so getting out of hand I'm- loving what I'm dreamin'!

Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!

Woke up in another world now we're on a sama girls
Getting our kimono on, singing karaoke songs,
Eating sushi, drinking tea in the shade of maple trees,
Lotus flowers everywhere breathing in exotic air,
Manga artists take a bow animes a total wow,
My imagination sparks when I'm in yoyogi park,
Could it be this distant land scrambled crossing up our plans
Loving cosplay, gotta say sayonara u.s.a.

Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!
OH Oh OH
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
