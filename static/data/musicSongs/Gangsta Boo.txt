Lyrics:


Haha whatâs up ladies 
How yaâll doinâ 
Yea I know what yaâll need 
All of yaâll 
And thatâs yaâll gangsta boo right 
Come on 
Mmm 
Yeaâ¦Yea 
Oh no no 

It was 6 oâclock on the dot 
Thatâs when I seen this cutie 
She was chillin' at the spot 
she was wit her girls 
I was wit my boys 
All of a sudden 
I asked her to come over and say 
âWot up ma 
Howâd you like to get to know me? 
Iâm not shy 
Iâll do anything for you and 
Iâm that guy 
Say I pick you up at eight 
I promise I wonât be lateâ 

[Girl] âCause all I ever wanted was 
Someone I could hold on to 
Someone who would never break my heart in two 
[Chris] can I be the one for you? 
[Girl] lets sing out and letâs see 

Shorty wanna rider (gangsta boo) 
I told her that Iâd call her (itâs true) 
Iâm not looking for the love but 
I think that youâre the one 
So come on come on 
Shorty want a baller (gangsta boo) 
Someone who can spoil her (itâs true) 
Iâm not looking for the love but 
I think that youâre the one 
So come on, come on 

I never met no-one like you before 
But I gotta take this chance 
Cause if I donât Iâll never know 
What this girl is really looking for 
I may not have all the money (so who cares) 
I may not have all the fancy cars (Iâd still be there) 
But what I have to give you baby 
Is so much more 

[Girl] âCause all I ever wanted was 
Someone I could hold on to 
Someone who would never break my heart in two 
[Chris] can I be the one for you? 
[Girl] lets sing out and letâs see 

Shorty wanna rider (gangsta boo) 
I told her that Iâd call her (itâs true) 
Iâm not looking for the love but 
I think that youâre the one 
So come on come on 
Shorty want a baller (gangsta boo) 
Someone who can spoil her (itâs true) 
Iâm not looking for the love but 
I think that youâre the one 
So come on, come on 

Hey shorty youâre the one 
Nice lips thick hips 
Put me on 
Too tough come on girl 
Break me off 
I canât see you wit nobody else 
Nobodyâs like your Chris (noo) 

Come on baby [x2]

Shorty wanna rider (gangsta boo) 
I told her that Iâd call her (itâs true â yes I did) 
Iâm not looking for the love but 
I think that youâre the one 
So come on come on 
Shorty want a baller (gangsta boo) 
Someone who can spoil her (itâs true) 
Iâm not looking for the love but 
I think that youâre the one 
So come on, come on 

ooohh ohh 
ohh no
