Lyrics:


Better than me
All of them bitches ain't better than me
I know you wanted somethin' else that you freak
You go thinkin' how you lost one and that's me (Yeah, yeah)

Better than me
She ain't no queen, I'm like Houdini
Put a little magic in you like they can't see me
She so thickie in that polka-dotted bikini
Baby, why you frontin'? You know that I been the best
I come for they neck, they run 'cause I'm next
You so in denial lately she just got you stressed
She got no finesse, she just get undressed
Yuh (Yuh), talk (Yuh)
Put the honey in the pot (Pot)
Put a nigga in his place
She don't wanna take my spot
Whoa (Whoa), whoa (Whoa)
She ain't even got my guap (Whoa)
She ain't got a lot to say (Say)
Even if she bring that talk

Better than me, better than me
The best pussy, come from wifey

Better than me
All of them bitches ain't better than me
I know you wanted somethin' else that you freak
You go thinkin' how you lost one and that's me 

Look, I can do that too, bitch, I can do that too
I can get him juiced, I can make him screw, and
Trust me, he wake up right in the mornin', or like two, and
Just to get a smooch, and, touch on that caboose, and
What they say about it? Oh, they say either you snoozin'
Honey, you just lose him, why the fuck he snoozin'?
Messin' with my man, shawty, you cruisin' for a bruisin'
Don't gotta be slimy, honey, swag is what I'm oozin'
And they call her a trick because all she got is illusions
We walk in the room and complement each other smoothly
'Member how I kissed you upside down, like in that movie
Let God be the judge and we can get rid of these Judas

Better than me (Better than me), better than me (She ain't better than me, baby)
The best pussy (Best pussy), come from wifey (Come from wifey)

Better than me (None of the bitches)
All of them bitches ain't better than me
I know you wanted somethin' else that you freak
You go thinkin' how you lost more and lost me
You go thinkin' how you lost one and that's me (Yeah, yeah)

You gon' figure out, baby
Careful who you fuckin' with, 'cause you just lost one
Just be careful who you fuckin' with, 'cause you just lost one
