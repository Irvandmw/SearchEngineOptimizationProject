Lyrics:


I'm done feeling like this
So down, so dark, so numb
And I'm done feeling like this
Like I did something wrong

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family

Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend
What made you think it was OK to run away?
I'm going off the deep end

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family
Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend

I can't understand how we could come undone
Is love really that bad that you have to turn and run?

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family

Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend
What made you think it was OK to run away?
I'm going off the deep end

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family
Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend

Maybe someday you'll see it my way
When worlds apart is just too hard to take
You're here and now you're gone
And I can't move on

I can't understand how we could come undone
Is love really that bad that you have to turn and run?

Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend
What made you think it was OK to run away?
I'm going off the deep end

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family
Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend
