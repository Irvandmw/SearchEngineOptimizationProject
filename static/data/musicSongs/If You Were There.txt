Lyrics:


You're the one that makes my day a dream come true
They might just be the last
Yet and still you wonder if
I think of you
You ought to see how the other girls behave when you're not around
And only then you would know that it's on your finger I'm wound

I you were there you'd know
I you were there you'd know
I you were there you'd know
I you were there you'd know
That I care

There's no need for you not to have faith in me
'Cos it's by your side girl that I long to be
Yes there are times with my friends when I don't know have to much to 
say What you don't know is with you could never act that way

I you were there you'd know
I you were there you'd know
I you were there you'd know
I you were there you'd know
That I care

I care for you baby, I
Swear that I care 
There's no need for you
Not to have faith in me
'Cos it's by your side girl
That I long to be
Yes there are times with 
my friends when I don't know 
have to much to say uh, uh 
What you don't know is 
with you could never act that way

I you were there you'd know
I you were there you'd know
I you were there you'd know
I you were there you'd know
That I care

I care for you , I
Swear that I care for you
Baby
I do 
Have faith in me 
I care for you baby
