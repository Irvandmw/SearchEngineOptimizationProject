Yo
Come on
Blue
That's right
You know what I'm saying

Come on
Come on

I think you're 'bout it, 'bout it
No man could ever doubt it
You're looking so delicious
Could this be the night that we uh?

Get closer just a little
(That's right.)
Take it up another level
Look it's just plain and simple
Could this be the night that we uh?

Don't fight it
(Come on.)
Can't hide it
Let's ride this
It just feel so right

Oh, you got the perfect body (uh, huh)
Love the way you're shaking it for me (uh, huh)
Can we take it up stairs from the lobby?
I don't see nothing in you and me bubbling

How do we get started?
How do we get private?
(That's right, girl.)
Once we get inside
It's gonna be troubling
You and me bubbling
(That's right)

Yo, yo, yo, come on

Why don't we get this popping?
Top floor with no disturbing
Room service in the morning
This will be the night that we uh

Elevators waiting open
Don't you think it's time we go in?
Can't keep the penthouse waiting
This will be the night that we uh

Clock's ticking
(That's right.)
Times wasting
And you're amazing
(Listen, girl.)
It just feel so right

Oh, you got the perfect body (uh, huh)
Love the way you're shaking it for me (uh, huh)
Can we take it up stairs from the lobby?
I don't see nothing in you and me bubbling

How do we get started?
How do we get private?
Once we get inside
It's gonna be troubling
You and me bubbling

Got a body like whoa
Why you waiting over there? Let's roll
Take it all the way to the top floor
And let's get bubbling, girl
Bubbling, girl

Got a body like whoa
Why you waiting over there? Let's roll
Take it all the way to the top floor
And let's get bubbling, girl
Bubbling, girl

(oh hahahah whoa)

Oh, you got the perfect body (uh, huh)
Love the way you're shaking it for me (uh, huh)
Can we take it up stairs from the lobby?
(Come on!)
I don't see nothing in you and me bubbling

How do we get started?
How do we get private?
(I need to know.)
Once we get inside
It's gonna be troubling
You and me bubbling

Oh, you got the perfect body (uh, huh)
Love the way you're shaken that for me (uh, huh)
Let's take it upstairs from the lobby
I don't see nothing in you and me bubblin'

How do we get started?
How do we get private?
Once we get inside
It's gonna be troublin'
You and me bubblin'

Wanna get bubbling, girl?
Penthouse is waiting, ha, ha, ha
