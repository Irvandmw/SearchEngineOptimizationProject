Lyrics:


If there's any justice in the world,
I would be your man,
You would be my girl,
If I'd found you first you know its true,
He would be alone,
I would be with you.

When you decide, don't let me down,
Coz there's nothing to be certain in my life,
And you've seen a thousand times
There's not much justice in the world

If there's any justice in your heart,
You love really changed,
Ease it into heart,
Why don't you remember how it feels,
Not to give a damn,
For anyone but me

I cant believe you'd be decieved,
Changing memories from truth to fantasy,
Where there's nothing left but tears,
there's not much justice in the world

Just because he's wrapped around your finger,
Don't fool yourself with dreams that might appear,
Everytime you'll stop and trust your feelings,
The truth is out there somewhere
It's just blowing in the wind

If there's any justice in the world,
I would be your man,
You would be my girl,

If I'd found you first you know its true,
He would be alone,
I would be with you,

When you decide, don't let me down,
Coz there's nothing to be certain in my life,
And you've seen a thousand times
There's not much justice in the world

If I should lose you girl you know,
That there's not much justice in the world
