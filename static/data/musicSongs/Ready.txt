Lyrics:


You tell me that you're ready but you just don't know
My eyes are getting heavy and it's starting to show
Never seen it coming, never seen a thing
Maybe I'll get through what's ever coming to me

Cause I've been so unlucky I don't know what to say
Running out of money I've been wasting away
I never seen it coming never seen a thing
Maybe I'll get through what's ever coming to me

We fall
We fall down
If we fall
We fall down
If we fall down hard I'll be ready to grow

I'm ready
I'm ready for it
I'm ready
I'm ready for it
I'm ready
I'm ready for it all

Look me in the eye when I am talking to you
It's easy to get nervous I've been feeling it too
Yeah it's kind of crazy, yeah it's kind of dumb
But never let the pressure overpower the fun

Yeah I'm sure your parents probably said it to you
Follow what you love and you will love what you do
And never let the pressure tell you that you're not
Capable of being everything that you want

We fall
We fall down
If we fall
We fall down
If we fall down hard I'll be ready to grow

[x2:]
I'm ready
I'm ready for it
I'm ready
I'm ready for it
I'm ready
I'm ready for it all

[x2:]
I'm ready
I'm ready for it
I'm ready
I'm ready for it
I'm ready
I'm ready for it all

Look me in the eye when I am talking to you
It's easy to get nervous I've been feeling it too
Yeah it's kind of crazy, yeah it's kind of dumb
But never let the pressure overpower the fun

I'm ready
I'm ready for it
I'm ready
I'm ready for it
I'm ready
I'm ready for it all
