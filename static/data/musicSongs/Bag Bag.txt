Oh yeah
Hey
DaBaby
Firzt on the track
Woo, Sosa

Big racks (Yeah), boss up (Boss up), baller (Mm), cross up (Cross up)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed (Yeah)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag, the bag bag, bag bag
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag
Hoppin' out I got
Big racks, boss up (Ayy), baller (Yeah), cross up (Cross up)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed (Ayy)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed
Yeah, yeah
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag, the bag bag (Yeah, yeah)
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag

I'm jumping out [?] big racks
LOL I got the last laugh
Bitch act like she wan' know my whole past
Yeah, we hittin' licks, split it right down the middle
They run up on me, tell 'em back back
Got a whole lotta enemies, I keep a pistol
That's a rubber band 'round the dirty cash
Nigga run up on me bet he gon' get his issue
And tell him can get his bitch back
Got him, bent her over eatin' gumbo and [?]
I won't call her back, I won't even reconsider
I got too much baby on me, baby, I'm trippin'
Count up the check, I'ma hop out the [?]
Yeah, I know she love me, gotta act like I miss her
Even though I'm on another wave now
We back at the table to top off the skrilla
Hoppin' out I got

Big racks (Yeah), boss up (Boss up), baller (Mm), cross up (Cross up)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed (Yeah)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag, the bag bag, bag bag
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag
Hoppin' out I got
Big racks, boss up (Ayy), baller (Yeah), cross up (Cross up)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed (Ayy)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed
Yeah, yeah
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag, the bag bag (Yeah, yeah)
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag

Celebration, celebration (For real)
I took your bitch I want a trophy
I'm never chasin', never chasin' (Ayy)
When you got the bag they bust it open (For real)
Saw me swaggin', now it's over (Ayy)
Hate to say I told you but I told you (Yeah)
Woulda thought they had me under pressure
I'm never my losing my composure (Hey, nah)
You ain't gotta like it but you gon' respect it
Got some racks out the air for the time I invest it (Ayy)
Pull up with big B's, I hop out that beamer (Skrr, skrr)
My life just needed a little correction
Whole time I don't want no favors
And in my position put in no effort
Can't trust these hoes, no, they all reckless
I was down bad, we took up the level
Bitch, now I got

Big racks (Yeah), boss up (Boss up), baller (Mm), cross up (Cross up)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed (Yeah)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag, the bag bag, bag bag
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag
Hoppin' out I got
Big racks, boss up (Ayy), baller (Yeah), cross up (Cross up)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed (Ayy)
These bad hoes all gettin' slayed
Yeah, yeah
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag, the bag bag (Yeah, yeah)
Had to pull up on her with the bag bag (Pull up)
