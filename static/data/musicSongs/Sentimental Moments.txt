Lyrics:


Sentimental moments
Moments that you shared with me
They will last forever, and ever, and ever in my memory

Sentimental moments
How I treasure every one
And I live them over, and over, and over when my day is done

Those happy endless walks
The quiet talks, the music
The crazy things that lovers do when love is new

Sentimental moments
Share them once again with me
And they'll bring us closer, and closer, and closer
Like we used to be

Those happy endless walks
The quiet talks, the music
The crazy things that lovers do when love is new

Sentimental moments
Share them once again with me
And they'll bring us closer, and closer, and closer
Like we used to be
