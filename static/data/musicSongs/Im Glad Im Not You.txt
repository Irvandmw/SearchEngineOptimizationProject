Lyrics:


Itâs been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me
All thatâs left is shattered hearts
Itâs plain enough for us to see that
Youâve got me
Youâve got me

Weâre just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
Itâs no fuss
Iâm not in love

Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
Youâve got me
Youâve got me

Weâre just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
Itâs no fuss
Iâm not in love

I lost it in your kiss, your lips,
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healerâs touch
Itâs true
Iâm glad Iâm not you
