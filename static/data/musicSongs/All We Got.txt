Lyrics:


And we back
And we back
And we back

And we back
And we back
And we back

This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like AndrÃ©
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancÃ©e
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie YoncÃ©

Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll probably cry at my own service

Cause it was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
You know what I mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the words
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third

This is the music's all we got
So we might as well give it all we got (yeah)
This is the music's all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Cause this is all we got

I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
Doesn't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day

Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Cause this is all we got
