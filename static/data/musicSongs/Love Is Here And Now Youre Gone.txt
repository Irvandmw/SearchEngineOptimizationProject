Lyrics:


Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now, now you're gone

You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness
That was waiting there

You closed the door to your heart
And you turned the key, locked your love away from me

Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone

You made me love you
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love
Came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left it's trace

After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone

You made me love you
Oh, my darling
Now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh, my darling
Now you're gone
