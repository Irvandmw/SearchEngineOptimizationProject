Song Name: A Place In The Shade
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Now some folks play the whole day long
They think they got it made
But they won't get a thrill the way that I live
When I find me a place in the shade
A poor man word is never learned still I wouldn't trade
All the world and its gold all the treasures untold
I want a little place in the shade
Too late to bed and early to rise
Makes a man weary and cuts him down the size
They come and they go and their worlds fall apart
But I'm gonna cling to the dreams in my heart
Cause someday I know the years gonna come
When all my debts are paid
When my work is all done I'll smile at the sun
And find me a place in the shade
When the work is all done I'll smile at the sun
And find me a place in the shade
