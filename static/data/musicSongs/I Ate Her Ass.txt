Lyrics:


I'm still a kid
Look at my dick
But I made these hits
That'll shape your kids
If I shake my hips
They'll display their tits
It is weird, yet lit
What a chain of events
I've been fuckin
I ate her ass
She came, I gasped
I went again
Won't make my bed
My Mom got pissed
She said, "don't rap"
Guess what? I did
Oh yeah
All my haters hands up on their heads
I'm abusin substances with guys in the NFL
I just stole a Perrier from Kodak Black
From his dressing room
While he was on stage
I was thirsty, back up off me
This is just hip hop
But my shit pop
I wear flip flops
To my biz ops
Ain't no wristwatch
Pretty women all up on my arm
I don't think I need to make more charm
