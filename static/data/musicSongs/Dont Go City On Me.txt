Lyrics:


I remember you in that jacked up Jeep
Hair blowing, sipping Mickey Dâs sweet tea
Cheap sunglasses and paisley boots 
Long tan legs and those daisy dukes
Stopping for every single yard sale sign
What I wouldnât give to do that one more time

[Chorus:]
Donât go city on me
Please girl, keep it country
Lifeâs so different since you crossed those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back
Donât go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and your Miss Me jeans
The girl I knew wouldnât need those things
Donât go city onâ¦
Donât go city on me

Never knew what city lights looked like 
In the bed of a truck
On a summer night sky
Traffic jams on a gravel road
Donât you miss our old blue oak
Climb up on that rock and you held my hand 
So Iâm going to say this once again

[Chorus]

You threw me back in, gave me one last kiss
Said girl it donât have to end like this 

[Chorus]

Donât go, baby
Donât go, no
Donât go city on me
Donât go, keep it country
