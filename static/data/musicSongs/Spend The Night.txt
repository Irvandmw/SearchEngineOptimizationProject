Lyrics:


I've never asked to define our time
It's understood
So crystal clear
When your eyes lock mine
We so connect
But we're almost scared of it
So no strings attached
Is where it's at
For the moment

So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night

Yeah, I play cool
Like I've met a hundred yous
And for tonight
You're just right
To be the one I use
But you break me down
I forget the games I play
Oh you wrap me up
In your arms and I just melt away

So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night

Oh if I could freeze this moment
In my heart shaped locket
Wear you around my neck
So you won't be forgotten
I would, I would
Oh if I could tell you everything
I feel for you baby
Spill my heart out on the floor
And have it be reciprocated
I would, you know I would

So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Oh baby relax
Oh baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Undo my dress, let down my hair
(Oh if I could freeze this moment in my heart shaped locket
And let's just wear you around my neck so you won't be forgotten)
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
