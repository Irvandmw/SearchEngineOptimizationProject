Lyrics:


So many riffs you have with your girl
But I'm here to hear all your problems and tell you I understand
Falling in and out of love with her now
As I watch all I can see... is you being with me
I know you feel like a fool
Being used, paying dues
Afraid of your loving is taken advantage of
You don't have to live a life full of strife
Take my hand and I'll be the leader
You can depend on me

You can be living in my world
Sharing my time, being the one
Stare in the face of love
Long enough to see
You can be living in my world
You'll never shed another tear
And I'll never stop the love
I'll give you all of me

With open eyes and ears, I can hear your cries come from the inside
But baby its alright, you can just let it go, I'm your friend
Sitting here, willing to listen...
Oh, baby see that you don't have to live
Like you do, come with me be my king I'll be by your side
Just let me know what to do, only one goal in mind
Take your heart, share with mine, make you believe
So you can see that

You can be living in my world (Living in my world)
Sharing my time, being the one (Sharing my time)
Stare in the face of love (Stare in the face)
Long enough to see (See)
You can be living in my world (In my world)
You'll never shed another tear (Another tear)
And I'll never stop the love
I'll give you all of me

It only takes one look to see
That she's a fool and you should know
Come with me, and I will be
All that you need
There are no dreams we can't make real
And there are no feelings we can't feel
I'm just...
Wanting you...
Needing you...
Don't you know

You can be living in my world (With me)
Sharing my time, being the one (In my world)
Stare in the face of love (Face of love)
Long enough to see (Long enough to see)
You can be living in my world (Living in my world)
You'll never shed another tear (You'll never shed another tear)
And I'll never stop the love (I'll never stop)
I'll give you all of me (I'll give you all of me)

You, oh you...
You can be living in my world (Living in my world)
Sharing my time, being the one (Sharing my time)
Stare in the face of love (Stare in the face)
Long enough to see (See)
You can be living in my world (Living)
You'll never shed another tear (Another tear)
And I'll never stop the love
I'll give you all of me

You can be living in my world (With me)
Sharing my time, being the one (In my world)
Stare in the face of love (Face of love)
Long enough to see (Long enough to see)
You can be living in my world (Living in my world)
You'll never shed another tear (Another tear)
