Lyrics:


Hey, lover man
Here you got a plan
Sure cure for love ain't by
What you got to make me smile
Amuse me for a little while

I said
Oh oui oh oui
Can you erase his memory?
You can do it baby!
Oh oui oh oui
Can you pull out the fire in me?

Boy, shake a leg!
Don't make me beg!
Touch me touch me!
Touch me touch me up, oh yeah oh!
Touch me touch me touch me up!
Touch me touch me touch me!
Touch me up!

Do it baby 
Get it, get it get it get it get it baby
Touch me touch me touch me touch me touch me

Don't want love just a little romance
Heart is weak I can't take time
You'll have your freedom and I'll have mine
Just happy days and happy times

I said
Oh oui oh oui
Can you erase his memory?
You can do it baby!
Oh oui oh oui
Can you pull out this fire in me?

Boy, shake a leg!
Don't you make me beg!
Touch me touch me!
Touch me touch me up, oh yeah oh!
Touch me touch me touch me up, oh!
Touch me touch me touch me!
Touch me up, oh!
Touch me up touch me up!
