Lyrics:


Iâd work for you, slave for you
Iâd even be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isnât love itâll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

Iâd gladly, Iâd gladly, Iâd gladly move the earth for you
Oh, just to prove my love and itâs worth for you
Now, if that isnât love itâll just have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just canât sing to make you understand
Iâll always love you darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?

Iâd sigh, Iâd sigh for you, Iâd even cry for you
Iâd reach out and even tear the stars out of the skies for you
Now if that isnât love itâll just have to do
Until the real thing comes along
Until the real thing comes along
