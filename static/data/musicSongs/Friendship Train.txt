Lyrics:


You've been hurt and I've been hurt
Now we're living pain
Take my hand and ride with me
On the friendship train
We'll go some little place
And wait for the end
There I hold and comfort you
And love you like a friend

I'll love you like a friend
When you cry I'll lie and say
You're not feeling like yourself today
I'll love you like a friend
When you're blue
I'll do anything and everything you want me to
I'll do for you

And I'll do for you
You've been down and I've been down
Down I guess we'll stay
Love was just another word
We taught someone to say
So let's ride the friendship train
Who knows we might win
But win or lose, I'll stay with you
Love you like a friend

I'll love you like a friend
When you cry I'll lie and say
You're not feeling like yourself today
I'll love you like a friend
When you're blue
I'll do anything and everything you want me to
I'll do for you

And I'll do for you
And I'll do for you
And I'll do for you
And I'll do for you
I'll do for you
