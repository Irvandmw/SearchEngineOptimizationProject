Lyrics:


He lived his life in isolation,
A man without a name.
Saddled with a reputation,
From Cheyenne he came.
He moved down South when the money ran out
And turned to a life of crime.
Things weren't all that different then,
They'd kill you for a dime.
Never showed no mercy,
Had a heart of stone,
And his hands were dirty,
Stained to the bone. He said . . .

"Turn back! It's too late.
All I can do is pray there's another heaven.
Turn back! It's too late.
Sinners like me need another heaven.
Turn back! It's too late.
I've run out of time."

He lived at least a dozen lifetimes,
Luck was on his side.
The only friend he ever had
Was his trusty forty-five.
His final words to my grand-daddy were,
"Son, you must be brave."
And all that's left of what he was
Is in this Texas grave!
He could smell the danger.
Ooh, he knew the end was near.
Through the smoke and whiskey,
One thing was clear. He said . . .

"Turn back! It's too late.
All I can do is pray there's another heaven.
Turn back! It's too late.
Sinners like me need another heaven.
Turn back! It's too late.
All I can do is pray there's another heaven.
Turn back! It's too late.
I've run out of time.
Look me in the eyes.
I wanna see it comin'."

[Guitar Interlude]

He never showed no mercy,
Ooh, he had a heart of stone,
And his hands were dirty,
Stained to the bone!

"Turn back! It's too late.
All I can do is pray there's another heaven.
Turn back! It's too late.
Sinners like me need another heaven.
Turn back! It's too late.
I've run out of time.
Turn back! It's too late.
Sinners like me need another heaven, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Turn back! It's too late.
All I can do is pray there's another heaven.
Turn back! It's too late.
I've run out of time.
Look me in the eyes.
I wanna see it comin'.
I wanna see it comin', yeah.
I wanna see it comin'. Yeah, yeah.
I wanna see it comin', baby!"

Ooh. . . .
