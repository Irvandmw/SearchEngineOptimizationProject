Lyrics:


Everybody said that it wasn't love. I was dumb.
I was getting high on your sugar rush for too long.

You told me that we could have it all,
Now you're posting pictures on your wall,
Of you and her together, what the hell?
We were in heaven then we fell.

I believed you, said I'd never leave you.

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong.
You took all my money and you went off on the run.
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun.

You told me that we could have it all.
Now you're posting pictures on your wall,
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun.

Everybody said, "Careful of that guy."
Baby, couldn't stop, it was suicide.
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide.
You were feigning love by holding tight.

But I need you, don't want to, but need to.

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong.
You took all my money and you went off on the run.
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun.

You told me that we could have it all.
Now you're posting pictures on your wall,
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun.

You've been messing 'round with my beating heart,
You should be ashamed.
Boy, you never loved me from the start,
Such a wicked game.
I told you I needed somebody,
I never used you for love or for money, boy.
I feel like I can't trust nobody,
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody now.

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong.
You took all my money and you went off on the run.
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun.

You told me that we could have it all.
Now you're posting pictures on your wall,
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun.
