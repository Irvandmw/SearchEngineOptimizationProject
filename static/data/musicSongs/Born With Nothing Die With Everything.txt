Lyrics:


Fed-up 
Tired 
Sick and twisted 
One-man army 
I'm enlisted 
Trust yourself trust no one else 
Fuck a hero be yourself 
I don't need your lousy hand-out 
Clinched fists i'll fight my way out 
Fighting my way out 
Find my way out 

People wake up and sing along 
I trust no one 
My trust is gone 

Born with nothing 
Die with everything 

In a daze 
These days go by 
Faster and faster I speed through life 
Now I've got to take control 
Of my mental and my physical 
Never sheltered from life's hard storms 
I was cold but now I am warm 
Inside I'm warm 

Searching and finding the truth inside myself 
Inside myself 

My soul was starving 
I was born with nothing 
I'll die with everything
