Song Name: Leaving Home
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


East Coast trains run slow
And Edinburgh seems cold
For eighteen year olds
Freedom

But Leith feels like New York
All the cars and talk
Moving down the Walk
All day

So Iâm lying in this hotel
Hearing sirens and drunken fights
But I paid cash to the angels
Guarding me tonight

So Iâm lying in this hotel
Hearing sirens and drunken fights
And I paid cash to the angel
Guarding me tonight

Long days on my own
Cry when I come home
Have to carry on
Somehow

Leith could be New York
All the cars and talk
Moving down the Walk
All day
