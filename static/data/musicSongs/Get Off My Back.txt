Lyrics:


Well you think that you can take me on
You must be crazy
There ain't a single thing you've done
That's gonna faze me

Oh, but if you wanna have a go
I just wanna let you know

Get off of my back and into my game
Get out of my way and out of my brain
Get out of my face or give it your best shot
I think it's time you better face the fact
Get off of my back

You know it's all just a game that I'm playing
Don't think that you can't find a way in
That's what I'm saying

Oh, if you wanna have a go
I just wanna let you know

Oh, get off of my back and into my game
Get out of my way and out of my brain
Get out of my face or give it your best shot
I think it's time you better face the fact
Get off of my back

Oh, if you wanna have a go
I just wanna let you know

Get off, get off, get off of my back and into my game
Get out of my way and out of my brain
Get out of my face or give it your best shot
You know this train is coming off this track
Get off of my back
Yeah, get off of my back
Get off
Yeah

Oh
Get off
Get off
Get off
Get off
Get off
Get off
Get off

Get off of my back
