Lyrics:


I have seen better days
Seek shelter from the storm
Where it follows me, your sin follows me
Like a black cloud

Weâre running with no cover
I fear that I may drown
Where it follows me, your sin follows me
Like a black cloud

And Iâm so close to giving up
I have lost my fire and I stopped struggling
It knocks me down

I let your love wash over me
Youâll be my life jacket, youâll come to save me
Here comes the tide that tries to drag me under
Youâll be my life jacket, your love, it helps me

Floating in your oceans
I feel like I can breathe
You came for me, you came for me
Before I drowned

And now only my heart swims
For you and me
Finally, yes finally,
I have been found

I was so close to giving up
I have lost my fight and I stopped struggling
It knocks me down

I let your love wash over me
Youâll be my life jacket youâll come to save me
Here comes the tide that tries to drag me under
Youâll be my life jacket, your love, it helps me

Floating in your oceans
I feel like I can breathe
You came for me, you came for me
Before I drowned

I let your love wash over me
Youâll be my life jacket youâll come to save me
Here comes the tide that tries to drag me under
Youâll be my life jacket, your love, it helps me
