Lyrics:


It would be a comfort to know you never doubt me 
even though I give you cause most every day 
Sometimes I think that you'd be better off without me 
although I love you in my own peculiar way! 

Don't doubt my love if sometimes my mind should wander 
to a suddenly remembered yesterday 
My thoughts could never stray too long away from you 
because I love you in my own peculiar way! 

Though I may not always be the way you'd have me be 
though my faults may grow in number day by day 
Let no one ever say I've ever been untrue 
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way! 

I'll always love you... 
in my own peculiar way!
