Lyrics:


I know my parents loved me
Stand behind me come what may (hmm)
I know now that I'm ready, yeah
For I finally heard them say

It's a different world (ooh ooh)
Than where ya come from
Yes it is now, yeah

Here's our chance to make it
If we focus on our goal
You can dish it, we can take it (hey!)
Just remember that you've been told

It's a different world (it's a different world)
It's a different world (it's a different world)
Than where ya come from
Ooh ooh oooh
Than where ya come from!
