[Konshens:]
Yeah, oh yeah
Hey, girl, baby

[Enrique Iglesias (Konshens):]
I like the way that you moving (that you moving)
Baby, don't stop what you doing (yeah, yeah)
You know I came here for you, girl
I don't dance without you
I know you came for the music (for the music)
I know you came here to lose it (oh, yeah)
You got me so into you, girl
I don't dance without you

Last night I got you drunk
Last night, I fell in love
It's not really like me
But girl, you surprised me
I got an open mind
If you wanna cross that line
You know where I'll be, I'll be

Tell me what you want from me (tell me what you want)
Tell me what you need (tell me what you need)
I'll give you everything I got
When it's only you and me (yeah), only you and me

I like the way that you moving (way you move)
Baby, don't stop what you doing (oh, woah)
You know I came here for you, girl
I don't dance without you
I know you came for the music
I know you came here to lose it (yeah, yeah)
You got me so into you, girl
I don't dance without you

You say I move too fast
Slow down and just relax (slow down, down, down)
Hands on your waistline
Don't like to waste time
Sex written on your face
You never hesitate
I'll watch you all night, all night, yeah

Tell me what you want from me (tell me what you want)
Tell me what you need (oh, yeah)
I'll give you everything I got
When it's only you and me (baby, you and me), only you and me

I like the way that you moving (way you move)
Baby, don't stop what you doing (oh, woah)
You know I came here for you, girl
I don't dance without you
I know you came for the music
I know you came here to lose it (oh, yeah)
You got me so into you, girl
I don't dance without you

[Konshens:]
Come here, baby, pull up closer to me body
Real don daddy, know fi mek yuh happy
And if yuh down to take the ride tonight
I'ma take you on a flight tonight
Come here, baby, pull up closer to me body
Real don daddy, know fi make yuh happy
And if yuh down to take the ride tonight
I'ma take you on a flight tonight
