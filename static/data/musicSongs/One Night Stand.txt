Lyrics:


Heard the call and I packed it all
And I'm on the road again
If you can help to ease my load
I will be your friend
But the morning brings the sunlight
And the sunshine brings my train
So I say goodbye to New York
I'm an L.A. man again

One night stand in New York City
Lights are bright and the girls are pretty
Held her heart and I held her hand
Goodbye lady, I'm a one night stand

Oklahoma, Arizona, I wish I knew for sure
Came to town and I held my ground
That's what I came here for
But there's voices in the distance
And they're calling me back home
Guess my fate is not my own

Gypsy queens and magazines, livin' off the land
Don't make ties and don't tell lies
Do the best you can
But of every place I've been to
And of everything I've seen
I feel lonesome amongst strangers
I feel naked without string

One night stand in New York City
Lights are bright and the girls are pretty
Held her heart and I held her hand
Goodbye lady, I'm a one night stand
Goodbye lady, I'm a one night stand
