Lyrics:


Baby you've been giving feeling to me all night
And I can't leave unless you're leaving with me tonight
Now it's not difficult to tell oh baby you're selecting
And I think you're selecting me

To lead you
Y llevarte al cielo
Baby can't you see?

I wanna leave with you
Gotta take you home
I can see it inside my head
That if I leave with you and I get you home
Baby you're gonna love what I do
When I'm on top of you
When I'm on top of you

There's no need for us to see the future tonight
I just wanna live inside this moment all night
No, it's not difficult to tell baby I'm attracted
That's the way you make me feel

I wanna lead you
Y llevarte al cielo
Baby can't you see

I wanna leave with you
Gotta take you home
I can see it inside my head
That if I leave with you and I get you home
Baby you're gonna love what I do
When I'm on top of you
When I'm on top of you

Something I can't define
But your eyes tell the story
When my love fills you up
You'll never come down
No, you'll never come down

I wanna leave with you
Gotta take you home
I can see it inside my head
That if I leave with you and I get you home
Baby you're gonna love what I do

I wanna leave with you
Gotta take you home
I can see it inside my head
That if I leave with you and I get you home
Baby you're gonna love what I do
When I'm on top of you

Baby you're gonna love what I do
When I'm on top of you
