Lyrics:


[Mike Shinoda:]
This is war with no weapons,
Marching with no stepping,
Murder with no killing,
Illing every direction.
First, no sequel,
Do the math, no equal
John with no Yoko
More power, less people
And no I'm not afraid of that
Print it in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact
To act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade
That's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave 'em laying on the pavement
Bang
Fade to black

[Chester Bennington:]
In the wastelands of today,
When there's nothing left to lose,
And there's nothing more to take,
But you force yourself to choose,
In the wastelands of today,
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away,
And your hope turns into fear,
In the wastelands of today

[Mike Shinoda:]
Roll credits, to get it,
The show's done,
They're talking for just talking,
But meaning they got none,
None of 'em come proper,
They talk like a shotgun,
But how many got bred with integrity,
Not one
So no, I'm not afraid to see these suckers hold a blade to me,
Ain't a way to shake the ground I built before you came to be,
Take it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy,
And this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see...

[Chester Bennington:]
In the wastelands of today,
When there's nothing left to lose,
And there's nothing more to take,
But you force yourself to choose,
In the wastelands of today,
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away,
And your hope turns into fear,
And your hope turns into fear,

In the wastelands of today!

In the wastelands of today,
When there's nothing left to lose,
And there's nothing more to take,
But you force yourself to choose,
In the wastelands of today,
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away,
And your hope turns into fear,
And your hope turns into fear,
In the wastelands of today!

In the wastelands of today!
In the wastelands of today!
