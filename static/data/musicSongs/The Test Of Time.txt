Lyrics:


Tonight I know the kiss we share
Is sweet beyond compare
But will it stand the test of time
The lovely glow that's in your eyes
The music in your sighs
Oh will they stand the test of time

Time changes mountains time changes rivers
Time changes winter to spring
Time changes everything they say
But if the thrill we feel tonight
Is really really right
You'll never take your hand from mine
And our love will stand the test of time

Time changes mountains time changes rivers
Time changes winter to spring
Time changes everything they say
But if the thrill we feel tonight
Is really really right
You'll never take your hand from mine
And our love will stand the test
The test of time
