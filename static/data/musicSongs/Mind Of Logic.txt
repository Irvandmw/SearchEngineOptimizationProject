Lyrics:


Step into the mind of a young man
And if you don't then I don't really give a damn
All I really wanna do is make you understand
But if you don't wanna listen I guess you ain't apart of the plan
Sorry if I digress all I ever wanted was to be the best
Through lyricism to put your mind to the test
Staying up late night no rest
Feelin' bullet proof, no vest
But I confess my minds a mess living in world of stress I digest
But I gotta keep grinding cause everyday success what I'm finding
And I don't give a damn if you hate on me
Cause when I blow what you gone say homie huh
Not a God damn thing
But that's enough of that I'll let my home girl sing

Knocked down round for round
You're feeling like your shot down
On the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)

Knocked down round for round
You're feeling like your shot down
On the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)

All I think about is music
Don't get me wrong I think of other things but this how I fuse it
So the whole wide world can use it
When you feel like you just might lose it take a breath home don't confuse it
Take a step in the Mind Of Logic
As long as you don't abuse it
So let me break it down for the whole world
Like I broke it down for my old girl
I cannot deal with your bullshit no more
Gotta let it go let it unfurl
Cause I remember the time
When I was living sublime wanted to make a living off of my rhymes
But the whole world told me never mind
I'm a star how could I not shine?

Knocked down round for round
You're feeling like your shot down
On the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)

Knocked down round for round
You're feeling like your shot down
On the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)

I just wanna take it to another level that I've never even been on
So I can sit on every single piece of paper that I put a pen on
And when I been on for like 10 year I'm gonna do it better then anyone ever before me
So the whole wide world will adore me and no need to assure me
And why you wonder why I'm rapping so fast it cause I gotta lot of things on my mind
That wanna come out at the same time
In other words I'm racing I used to pursuit my dreams which are now a reality
And that's what I'm chasing, why are we on this earth? Why must we feel pain?
Why does everybody feel the need to judge one another when were all the same

Knocked down round for round
You're feeling like your shot down
On the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)

Knocked down round for round
You're feeling like your shot down
On the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)
