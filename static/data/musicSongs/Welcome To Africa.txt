Welcome
Oh, na na na na na
Oh, na na na

Oh, yeah

Welcome to Africa, yeah (Oh)
Welcome to Africa, yeah (Oh, na na)
Oh, welcome to Africa, yeah (Oh-oh)
Welcome to Africa, yeah
Today I feel like a King
Today I feel like a King
Today I feel like a King now
Today I feel like a King
So, welcome to Africa, yeah
Ey, welcome to Africa, yeah

The place I will build you a dream house
If you wan dey oh
The place I will make you my dream spouse
If you wan dey oh
[?] you can scream out
Together I fuck you together
If you wan dey oh

Now you know better
This the place I want to be
If I won a lotto
Filthy rich don't wanna leave now
I never thought life would be so hard
It never got easy
But I thank God for this blessing, yeah

Welcome to Africa, yeah (Oh)
Welcome to Africa, yeah (Oh, na na)
Oh, welcome to Africa, yeah (Oh-oh)
Welcome to Africa, yeah
Today I feel like a King
Today I feel like a King
Today I feel like a King now
Today I feel like a King
So, welcome to Africa, yeah
Ey, welcome to Africa, yeah

Opportunity lies between these trees
Living a stressful life it ain't my dream
Sipping an Espresso
The good life no more ghetto
Paparazzi want to take photos
Take as much as you want to
You know better
This the place I want to be

Now you know better
This the place I want to be
If I won a lotto
Filthy rich don't wanna leave now
I never thought life would be so hard
It never got easy
But I thank God for this blessing, yeah

Welcome to Africa, yeah (Oh)
Welcome to Africa, yeah (Oh, na na)
Oh, welcome to Africa, yeah (Oh-oh)
Welcome to Africa, yeah
Today I feel like a King
Today I feel like a King
Today I feel like a King now
Today I feel like a King
So, welcome to Africa, yeah
Ey, welcome to Africa, yeah
