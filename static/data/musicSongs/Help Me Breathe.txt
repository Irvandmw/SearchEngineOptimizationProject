[Future]
Wheezy outta here

[Young Thug:]
Drop to my knees
Beggin' you, please
Lickin' my teeth
Call the police
I'm searchin' for peace
Nuttin' three or four times
Automatic drapes gonna wake you, no blinds
You're my mommy, yes, I know, ma
Someone call the officer, lift the blouse on her (Ayy)
Skinny dippin' with me and the shoes came first
2020 Bentley and it's all for her (Sheesh)
Keep it pimpin' with me and we both say, "Church" (Woo)
I did Oxycontin for the first time (Yee)
Better hide your wifey, I'm on thirst time
Jewelry on me icey, I'm on surf time
Fall to my knees

[Young Thug & Future:]
You helpin' me to breathe, yeah
You helpin' me to breathe, yeah (Yeah)
You helpin' me to breathe, baby
You helpin' me to (Oh, oh, oh)
You helpin' me to breathe, yeah
You helpin' me to breathe, yeah
You helpin' me to breathe (Baby), yeah
You helpin' me to breathe (Baby), yeah
You helpin' me to breathe, yeah
You helpin' me to breathe
You helpin' me to breathe, baby, yeah
You helpin' me to breathe (Yeah, yeah, Future Hendrix)

[Future:]
Helpin' me breathe (Yeah, yeah)
You weaken my knees (Yeah, yeah)
Got your Cubans obese, makin' it hard for you to leave
Popped a pill just to count this money, I been up for a week (Up)
I bought Prada 'cause I'm proud of you, just keep it a G (Proud of you), yeah
Cleanin' up fresh new designer, I'm goin' to surf (Surf)
I'll let you hit two cups of lean (Two), then it's church (Church)
Broke down my bells, you were right there baggin' my bowls up (Bag it up)
Some red bottoms for you like it's a dozen of roses (Yeah)
Cop the Eliante too, top tiers lookin' like boulders (Yeah, yeah)
I'm snatchin' up that coupe for you, put Ferarri on your motor, girl
Snatchin' up that new foreign that pretty girl in the morning
I done tried these shrooms, but you already rollin' (All night)
Took you 'cross the moon, you on the left ('Cross the moon)
When you high, and you jet fly, money storm in
I know you photogenic Monday through Sunday (I can see it)
I'm keepin' my eyes on you, you iconic (Soldier)

[Young Thug & Future:]
You helpin' me to breathe, yeah
You helpin' me to breathe (Helpin' me), yeah (Yeah)
You helpin' me to breathe, baby
You helpin' me to (Ohh, helpin' me)
You helpin' me to breathe (Helpin' me to breathe), yeah
You helpin' me to breathe (Helpin' me to breathe), yeah
You helpin' me to breathe (Helpin' me to breathe, baby), yeah
You helpin' me to breathe (Helpin' me to breathe, baby), yeah
You helpin' me to breathe (Breathe), yeah
You helpin' me to breathe, yeah
You helpin' me to breathe, baby (Baby)
You helpin' me to breathe (Don't make me suffer if it's nothin')

[Future:]
Without my heart, there's a chance I could die
I'll help no opp, some chance I could die
I'm gettin' 'bout high as that I'ma touch the sky
Comin' from the projects, most of these bitches shiesty
But you helpin' me to breathe (You helpin' me to breathe)
