Lyrics:


Tell me, milk cow,
What on Earth is wrong with you?
Oh, milk cow,
What on Earth is wrong with you?
Now, you've left you a calf
And your milk is turning blue.

Lord, your calf is hungry
And I believe he needs a suck.
Lord, your calf is hungry,
I believe he needs a suck.
Well, your milk is turning blue.
I believe he's out of luck.

Now, I feel like milking and my cow won't come.
I feel like churning and my milk won't turn.
I'm cryin' please,
Please, don't do me wrong.
If you see my milk cow, baby now,
Please drive her home.

Lord, my milk cow been rambling
For miles around.
Lord, my milk cow been rambling
For miles around.
Well, how can you suck on some other man's bull cow
In this strange man's town?
