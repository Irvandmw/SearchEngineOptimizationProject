Lyrics:


Non Dimenticar means don't forget your heart my darling
Don't forget to be all you mean to me

Non Dimenticar my love is like a star my darling
Shining bright and clear
Just because you're here

Please do not forget that our lips have met
And I held you tight dear
Was it dreams ago
My heart felt this glow only just tonight dear

Non Dimenticar although you travel far my darling
It's my heart you'll own so I'll wait alone
Non Dimenticar
Non Dimenticar although you travel far my darling
It's my heart you'll own so I'll wait alone Non Dimenticar
