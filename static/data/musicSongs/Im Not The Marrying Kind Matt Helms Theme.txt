Lyrics:


I go my way alone free and easy like a rolling stone
I am strictly on my own not the marrying kind
I'm happy being free no girl gonna put a rain on me
It's always gotta be I'm not the marrying kind
I've been known to run a mile when they try to lead me down the aisle
So if you want me to stay a while don't start changing my style
It's always been my plan to stay single any way I can
I'm just a happy man I'm not the marrying kind
I'm not the marrying kind
It's always been my plan...
Not the marrying kind I'm not the marrying kind
(Not the marrying not the marrying not the marrying kind)
