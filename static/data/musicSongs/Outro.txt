Na na na na naaaa
Heyyyyyyyy
Na na na na naaaa
They said noooo when I told them thaaaaat
I find a way to get to the toooop (to the tooop)
They didn't knoooow that eventuallyyyy I'd be the ONE to worry about (worry aboouuut)
When someoooone would mention meeeee they always try to say I'mma floooop
But this the sound of reveeeeeennnge
The sound of reveeeennnge
The sound of reveeeennnge
The sound of reveeeennnge
Reveeeennnge

[Chamillionaire]
Yeah, on the path to find out whose true
the only person you can really trust is you
And if you, feel like you can't even trust you
You can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge
and critics people that wanna see you fail
and tell you what you can do, shouldn't do, must do
And when you got that glow
Nobody's else words can really bugs you
Haha
Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
and sometimes you just feel like you have to sin to win
Sometmes it sound like (gun shot), It's what it coulda been
And when you get to the gates of heaven they probably wouldn't let you in
Haha
But to change that meaning of it success is what it is in the end
and instead of worrying about what it should of, could of, or would it been
You turn you head towards the future and keep it moviiin, knowwhatI'm sayin?
(Well say it again)
Keep it moviiiin, knowwhatI'm sayin?
Screw it then
KnooowwhatI'm sayiiiin?

If you waitiiiiin for me to faiiiil
Your time is running out on the clock (on the gloooock)
I'm runniiiiiiin to the finish yeeeeeaaahh
when I get there I ain't gonna stooooooop (gonna stoooop)
Success iiiiiiisssss what I couldn't haaaavve
but now I tell them look what I goooooott
This the sound of reveeeeeennnnge
The sound of reveeeeennnnnge
The sound of reveeeeeeennnnnnge
The sound of reveeeeennnnnge reveeeennnnge
Na na na na naaaa
Heeeeyyyyyyy
Na na na na naaaa
Na na na na naaaa
Heeeeyyyyyyy
Na na na na naaaa
