Lyrics:


Excuse me sir, do I have your attention?
Thereâs something if you donât mind Iâd like to mention
so open those ears, sit your butt down and shut your mouth up
Iâm aware that itâs hard for you to do that,
all I ask is lay down, put your feet up
now soak in, pay attention, learn a lesson loud and clear

[Chorus]
Hey, youâre a dirty liar,
you wrung me out for something I thought was right,
I wanted to be left alone,
not shown around like your golden prize.
Oh, I looked around,
look what happened, you found out:
You never satisfy me

Never trusted anyone in the first place,
you turned me up, you're disgusting anyway
Hear that music, crank it up,
is there something familiar in the singer's voice?
Turn it down, now listen to me,
what made you think you were my authority?
Iâm awake, finally now Iâm able to move on (just gotta tell the truth)

[Repeat Chorus]

Now do these words stick to you, hope they do
think about it, think about it
stick to you like superglue, keep you from the things you do

[Guitar solo]

Hey, youâre a dirty liar.
You wrung me out for something I thought was right.
I wanted to be left alone,
not shown around like your golden prize.
Oh, I looked around,
look what happened, you found out...

Hey, youâre a dirty liar,
you wrung me out for something I thought was right,
I wanted to be left alone,
not shown around like your golden prize.
Oh, I looked around,
look what happened, you found out:
You never satisfy me.
