Artist: Don McLean Lyrics
Song Name: When Love Begins
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


In someone's hand there is a land
Where I must surely go, where she is
To learn what she must know
When she gives all her love away

To him that seems as in her dreams
Unbroken by the storm on the sea
But quiet deep and warm ever free
To give his love away

And when these two have found the land
The world is not the same
For though it spins when love begins
The world is not the same

This is one change I always have longed for
I always belonged more to you than to anyone
And in your hand the stars the sand
The rain and wind are new, as we live
And learn what love can do
When we give all our love away

And now we too have found the land
The world is not the same
For though it spins when love begins
The world is not the same
