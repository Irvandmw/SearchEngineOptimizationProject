Lyrics:


Yes your love put a song put a song put a song in my heart
Never have I heard this beautiful music before
Yes your love put a song put a song put a song in my heart
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore

It wasn't too long ago I thought I would never know
What reason has anyone to sing a happy song
I knew only loneliness but then I found happiness
And now I just want the world to smile and sing along

Cause your love put a song put a song...
Yes your love put a song put a song...
