Lyrics:


Wrote myself a letter, I told myself a lie
That you'll be coming home soon and then your name I sigh
I read it every morning since you went away
I'm living in a dream world and dying a little more each day

Wrote myself a love song, believing every word
Saying that you love me in melodies unheard
You'll be coming home soon, and this time you will stay
I'm living in a dream world and dying a little more each day

Snow is on the sidewalk, it's cold inside my heart
I look up and I wonder, have I lost my guiding star
And everything is white outside, how can it be so dark?

Say a prayer and thank God that your love is mine alone
And never be another who could grace our happy home
Pray on Christmas morning that this time you will stay
But I'm living in a dream world and dying a little more each day
Yes, I'm dying
For love on Christmas day
