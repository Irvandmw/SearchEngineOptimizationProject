[Tyler Hubbard:]
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom

Lost myself
Just trying to find my unhappiness
And I get overwhelmed
'Cause baby you know I can make a mess
When I get...

In my head and I just wanna forget
About my long day, just trying to pay off my rent
So when I come home, I wanna spend every second with you
And girl I want you

[Both:]
To meet me in the bedroom, mmm-mmm
Meet me in the bedroom, mmm-mmm
We can talk about the world and how we'll fix it soon
I will dance and make the bed move in the bedroom
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom

[Meghan Trainor:]
You're keeping me sane
Baby you're my only medicine
You keep me wide awake
You're the reason I can dream again
When I get...

[Both:]
In my head and I just wanna forget
About my long day, just trying to pay off my rent
So when I come home, I wanna spend every second with you
Yeah I want you

To meet me in the bedroom, mmm-mmm
Meet me in the bedroom, mmm-mmm
We can talk about the world and how we'll fix it soon
I will dance and make the bed move in the bedroom
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom (oh)
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom (oh)
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom (oh)
Uh-ah

I'm over it
So why don't we unmake this bed?
'Cause lately I've been

In my head and I just wanna forget
About my long day, just trying to pay off my rent
So when I come home, I wanna spend every second with you
Yeah I want you

To meet me in the bedroom, mmm-mmm
Meet me in the bedroom, mmm-mmm
We can talk about the world and how we'll fix it soon
I will dance and make the bed move in the bedroom
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom (oh)
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom (oh)
In the bedroom
Meet me in the bedroom (oh)
Uh-ah
