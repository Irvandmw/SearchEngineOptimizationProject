Lyrics:


There was a hentai video that I saw
I told you about the night that we first made love
About a girl who soon as she made you come
Showed you the future, told you your fortune

Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

Told you I wanted to die in an airplane crash
Over the ocean, thought it was romantic
But you didn't like it, thought it was stupid, ah
Thinking of me dead is making you feel bad

Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you
