Lyrics:


I know water, that's
Thicker than blood, that's
Deeper than love with my friends
People come, and
Some people go, and
Some people ride to the end

When I am blind, in my mind
I swear they be my rescue, my lifeline
I don't know what I'd do if I, if I'd survive
My brothers and my sisters, in my life, yeah

I know some people, they would die for me
We run together, they're my family
When I get up they gon' be high with me
I'll say forever my family, family
I'll say forever my family, family
I'll say forever my family

Stolen dreams took our
Our childish days, still
Ain't nothing changed now we're grown
We're still young, still got
Our mindless ways, and our
Timeless phase, kicking songs

When I am blind, in my mind
I swear they be my rescue, my lifeline
I don't know what I'd do if I, if I'd survive
My brothers and my sisters, in my life, yeah

I know some people, they would die for me
We run together, they're my family
When I get up they gon' be high with me
I'll say forever my family, family
I'll say forever my family, family
I'll say forever my family

I know some people, they would die for me
We run together, they're my family
When I get up they gon' be high with me
I'll say forever my family
