Lyrics:


We donât communicate can you not say whatâs on your mind?
And I see it every day you hide the truth behind your eyes.
Honestly, thereâs no need for you to hide.
Talk to me, canât you see? Iâm on your side.

Honest, honest.
Say what it is youâre trying to say,
But if you lie to me again.
I'll be the one that walks away.
Is it in you to be honest? Honest.
Is it in you to be honest?

I still remember the day we met I was hanging on your every word.
I didn't think I would ever let somebody see into my world.
Honestly, thereâs no need for you to hide.
Talk to me, canât you see? Iâm on your side.

Honest, honest.
Say what it is youâre trying to say,
But if you lie to me again.
I'll be the one that's walking away.
Is it in you to be honest? Honest.
Is it in you to be honest?

Is it all in my head or was it something I said?
Because Iâm trying to forgive, and now Iâm trying to forget,
Youâre telling me all of this, no more hearing of it,
It was all just a lie, was it all just a lie?
Was it all just a lie?

Honest, honest. Is it in you to be honest?
Say what it is youâre trying to say,
But if you lie to me again.
I'll be the one that walks away.
Is it in you to be honest?
Honest. Is it in you to be honest?
Is it in you to be honest?
