Lyrics:


God damn, God damn, God damn
Smack it, smack it in the air
I know you care

Smack it, smack
Smack it, smack it in the air
Smack it, smack it in the air

Wave your hands side to side, put it in the air
(Wave your hands side to side, put it in the air)
Clap, clap, clap like you don't care
Smack that, clap, clap, clap, like you don't care
(I know you care)

Clap it, clap it, clap it, clap it
Foot up, my foot up, hold up now my foot up
I'm spinnin' my foot up, foot up yeah my foot up
I'm spinnin' my foot up, put my foot down yeah my hands up
My hands up, my hands up (flexin') flexin' while my hands up

Hold that cup like alcohol, oh let go like alcohol
Hold that cup like alcohol, don't you drop that alcohol
Never drop that alcohol, never drop that alcohol
I know you thinkin' about alcohol
I know I'm thinkin' bout that alcohol

Man this here like rollin' dice, man this here like rollin' dice
Seven eleven, seven eleven, seven twice, man seven twice
Man it feel like rollin' dice, damn this feel like rollin' dice
Man it feel like rollin' dice, seven twice, seven twice
Man I'm tryna kick it with ya, damn I wanna kick it with ya
Man I wanna kick it with ya, I'll spin around and I'll kick it with ya

Shoulders sideways, smack it, smack it in the air
Legs movin' side to side, smack it in the air
Legs movin' side to side, smack you in the air
Shoulders movin' side to side, smack it, smack it in the air
Smack it, smack it in the air; smack it, smack it in the air
I know you care

Wave your hands side to side
Wave your hands side to side
Wave your hands side to side
Wave your hands side to side

Ooh wee Bey be freaky deaky, think me see she pink bikini
Rock that groovy dye dashiki, Nefertiti, edges kinky
Sweatin' out my blow out, sweatin' out my presses
This trick about to go off, mad cause I'm so fresh
Fresher than you, fresher than you
Fresher than you, oh
