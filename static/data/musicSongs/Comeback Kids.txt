Lyrics:


Do you remember the year 1989
That's when I started, shining, shining
In the summer heat on the Brooklyn streets
Baby, I came, my party inviting
Burst a fire hydrant
We burn brighter than the sun

You say I was born a loser
But I keep on winning
I keep on winning

Nah, nah here we go
Don't you know the night is young?
Screaming out all fucking long
Never stop the comeback kids
Naw naw we never sleep
Flamin' hearts don't skip a beat
A million strong, we flood the streets
Never stop the comeback kids

Now they chew me up, and then they spit me out
But I strike just like lightning, lightning
I'm just another face, a face in the crowd
Baby, I keep on rising, rising
Put it in the paper you know the fun has just begun

You say I was born a loser
But I keep on winning
I keep on winning

Nah, nah here we go
Don't you know the night is young?
Screaming out all fucking long
Never stop the comeback kids
Naw naw we never sleep
Flamin' hearts don't skip a beat
A million strong, we flood the streets
Never stop the comeback kids
Never stop the comeback kids
Never stop the comeback kids

Can you hear my blood boiling?
[?]
Forever came calling
No way out
[x2]

Nah, nah here we go
Don't you know the night is young?
Screaming out all fucking long
Never stop the comeback kids
Naw naw we never sleep
Flamin' hearts don't skip a beat
A million strong, we flood the streets
Never stop the comeback kids
Never stop the comeback kids
You never stop the comeback kids
