Lyrics:


It's only loving, in all its strangest ways
Listen up, it's only loving, no need to run away
Oh it's only loving, a search for higher ground
It's only loving, and only love can turn you around

Me, not be good. Me, not be right
Me, not be black. Me, not be white
Me, not be seen. Me, not be near
And what you're feeling may not be clear

Some people, they say, you got to be stronger
But don't you buy it
Look to yourself, let your heart be your guide
Why don't you try it?
The moon, it may fall. The mountains may crumble
No doubt about it
Oceans may rise. The [?] will tumble
But if I got you, I don't mind

It's only loving, in all its strangest ways
Listen up, it's only loving, no need to run away
Oh it's only loving, a search for higher ground
It's only loving, and only love can turn you around

Me, not be old. Me, not be new
Me, not be me. Me, not be you
Me, not before. Me, not be late
When evil come, will you wait?

Some people dream and I lost belief for the moment
But don't you buy it
Be true to yourself. Just follow your instincts
Why don't you try it?
If you stand tall, all over the round you were running
No doubt about it
These stars they may fall, the tide may be turning
But if I got you, then I don't mind

It's only loving, in all its strangest ways
Oh I know, it's only loving, no need to run away
Oh it's only loving, a search for higher ground
It's only loving, and only love can turn you around

It's only loving, in all its strangest ways
Oh I know, it's only loving, no need to run away
Oh it's only loving, a search for higher ground
It's only loving, and only love can turn you around

It's only loving, in all its strangest ways
Oh I know, it's only loving
