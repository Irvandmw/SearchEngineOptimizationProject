Lyrics:


Hello mister happiness, goodbye misery
I've got a pretty girl to walk along with me
Hello mister happiness, what was your delay
I nearly gave up hopin' love would come my way

Hello mister happiness, goodbye lonely room
I'll let all the sunshine in, and shut out all the gloom
Hello mister happiness, my baby loves me too
And my baby and I are gonna go steady with you

I wonder where you've been so long
I've searched everywhere
But when my baby smiled
You were standing there

Well hello mister happiness, goodbye loneliness
Now that you're here with me, you're my best friend I guess
Hello mister happiness, tell me it's okay
And you'll be my best man on my wedding day

I wonder where you've been so long
And I've searched everywhere
But when my baby smiled
You were standing there

Well hello mister happiness, goodbye loneliness
Now that you're here with me, you're my best friend I guess
Hello mister happiness, tell me it's okay
And you'll be my best man on my wedding day
