Lyrics:


It's been a while since I've been this way
You left your mark broken everything
But don't stop now take me all the way
(Close to close, this close to close)
They say love just isn't worth it
I say you gotta put the work in
That way you'll always gotta get what you give
(Close to close, this close to close)
You're this close to close

So stay right here and don't hold back
I'm into what you're doin' do it just like that
It's me and you forget the world
Just do what you doin'
Because you're this close to close
(Close to close, this close to close)

So don't stop now take my breath away
Don't let your heart try to play it safe
Please, you're this close to me
Last time love just wasn't working
This time I plan to put the work in
That way I'm always gotta get what I give
(Close to close, this close to close)
Ohh ohh This close to close

Stay right here and don't hold back
I'm into what you're doin' do it just like that
It's me and you forget the world
Just say what you're sayin'
Cause it's the best thing that I've heard

You don't know how far you've come
Leave your shield it's over
Let's just get it done
So stay with me and don't let go
Just do what you're doing
Because you're this close to close
(Close to close, this close to close)

It's been a while since I've been this way
You left your mark hope it never fades
But don't stop now take me all the way
Into your heart baby don't stop me fallin'

Stay right here and don't hold back
(Don't hold back)
I'm into what you're doin'
Doin' just like that
It's me and you forget the world
(Me and you, forget the world)
Just say what you're sayin'
Cause it's the best thing that I've heard

You don't know how far you've come
Leave your shield it's over
Let's just get it done
So stay with me and don't let go
Just do what you're doin'
Because you're this close to close

Stay right here, you're this close
Oooh you're close, you're this close
Do what you do, you're this close
(Say what you say)
Just do what you doin'
Because you're this close to close
