Lyrics:


Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
What you said, no, you can't take away
You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
Take a minute, do you need to stop and think?
What we have, no, we can't throw away, throw away

Show me that you mean it, ay
Show me that you mean it
Do you really mean it, ay
Everything happens for a reason
Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)
Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)

I hope you mean what you say, girl
Hope you ain't lying to my face, girl
You said you needed some space, girl
I tried to stay out your way, girl
You heard some stories about my past, hey
Wish we could leave them in the past, hey
You said it's hard for you to trust again
I wonder if you're really over it

Bounce back like a rebound
Are you saying what you mean now?

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
What you said, no, you can't take away
You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
Take a minute, do you need to stop and think?
What we have, no, we can't throw away, throw away

Show me that you mean it, ay
Show me that you mean it
Do you really mean it, ay
Everything happens for a reason
Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)
Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)

Time's up, what you gonna say next?
Can't hide what you did to me, yeah
Put you out like a cigarette
Put me out of my misery, yeah
It's not you it's me
Come on, seriously
Heard that once or twice before
You got that straight from a movie

Bounce back like a rebound
Are you saying what you mean now?

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
What you said, no, you can't take away
You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
Take a minute, do you need to stop and think?
What we have, no, we can't throw away, throw away

Show me that you mean it, ay
Show me that you mean it
Do you really mean it, ay
Everything happens for a reason
Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)
Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)
