Lyrics:


I betcha didn't know, you started up a chain reaction,
I saw no intention on your face,
It must have been some kind of chemical attraction.
I felt a spark, left a mark I can't erase.

It's like oh, oh,
Something like a bolt of lightning.
Oh, oh,
Is going on inside!

Cause I'm burning up it ain't no joke,
And all my cells are going rogue!
Caught up in a blaze with no way out.
And as my self-control goes up in smoke,
One more hit, I get so stoked that I,
I'm glowing in the dark,
You lit a fire in my heart!
(Fire in my heart)
You lit a fire in my heart.
(Fire in my heart)
You lit a fire in my heart.
(Fire in my heart)

It was kicking that beat, steady in my body, (my body)
Until you pumped it up with gasoline,
Struck a match and just like that you got me,
Now I'm the brightest firework you've ever seen.

It's like oh, oh,
No, there's no need to run for water,
Oh, oh,
Don't ever put me out.

Cause I'm burning up it ain't no joke,
And all my cells are going rogue!
Caught up in a blaze with no way out.
(Caught up in a blaze with no way out)
And if my self-control goes up in smoke,
One more hit, I get so stoked that I,
I'm glowing in the dark,
You lit a fire in my heart!

(Fire in my heart)
You lit a fire in my heart.
(Fire in my heart)

Oh, oh,
So come and warm your hands around me.
Oh, oh,
I will light you up tonight.

Cause I'm burning up it ain't no joke,
And all my cells are going rogue!
Caught up in a blaze with no way out.
(Caught up in a blaze with no way out)
And if my self-control goes up in smoke,
One more hit, I get so stoked that I,
I'm glowing in the dark,
You lit a fire in my heart!

Cause I'm burning up it ain't no joke,
And all my cells are going rogue!
Caught up in a blaze with no way out.
And if my self-control goes up in smoke,
One more hit, I get so stoked that I,
I'm glowing in the dark,
You lit a fire in my heart!
(Fire in my heart)
You lit a fire in my heart.
(Fire in my heart)
You lit a fire in my heart!
