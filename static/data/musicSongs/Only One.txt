Lyrics:


Only One can make the valley deep, 
The mountain high, the oak tree strong, 
Only One can bless us while we sleep, 
And give us faith to keep, 
To keep our whole life long . . . 

Only One can hear each prayer we say, 
And pray that we might learn His way, 
So has it always been, so shall it always be, 
As long as we believe in only One. . . 

Only one can make the valley deep, 
The mountain high, the oak tree strong . . . 
Only one can bless us while we sleep, 
And give us faith to keep, 
To keep our whole life long . . . 

Rich or poor, no matter who we are, 
We all are one to only One, 
So has it always been, so shall it always be, 
For all eternity, 
Only One!
