Lyrics:


Late at night, when the world is sleeping
You are frightened, 'cause the power's creeping
In your room is something you're afraid of
Life or doom is what this feeling's made of

Power fantastic
Is in your life at last
You're a little apprehensive
'Cause what it is, is what you want and need

Minor G is the chord of pleasure
It will be played eleven measures
You will see fire, but you're cool as ice
You lie if you say this isn't nice

Power fantastic
Is in your life at last
You're a little apprehensive
What it is, is what you want and need

Power, power

Power fantastic
Is in your life at last
You're a wee bit apprehensive
'Cause what it is, is what you want and need

Power, power, power fantastic
