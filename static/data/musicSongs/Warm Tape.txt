Lyrics:


Shiver for me girl
Deliver for me my darling
Pushinâ up to you
A river that runs right thru you
Swim for your smile
In a blue rock quarry
Make it for me baby
You wonât be sorry
Shiver for me now
Deliver for me my darling

Miles and miles of netherworlds I roam
Settle for love youâre never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the waters of love
Two of us were made of angels dust
Iâve been around
But not around enough

Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Quiver for me girl
Give me your head and shoulders
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and Iâm in your story
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm

Miles and miles of netherworlds I roam
Settle for love youâre never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the waters of love
Two of us were made of angels dust
Iâve been around
But not around enough

Letâs go
I know, I make it for two
Intuitions only what you take from it
I know, I make if for two
You were there and I was fortunate
I know I make it for two
And then a messy bed, apology that I will fall for you
I know I'll make it for two
I'll make it for two, I'll make it for two, and

Shiver for me now
Deliver for me my darling
A living that I could
Be giving to you my sweet love
Swim for your smile
In a blue rock quarry
Make it for me baby
You wonât be sorry
Shot from the pages of
Love and glory
Sleeping next to you
And Iâm in your dream

Settle for love
Settle for love
Settle for love
