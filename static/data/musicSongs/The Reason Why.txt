Lyrics:


Can't you see the reason why
I walked in, I sat right down and cried
Can't you see the reason why
I looked at you and knew it meant goodbye

You said that you loved me once before
And now you don't love me anymore
Well I tried, baby I tried

Can't you see the reason why
I try so hard to stop the tears I cry
Can't you see the reason why
There's nothing here without you, you're my life

We were so happy yesterday
But yesterday's come and gone today
So goodbye, baby goodbye

Can't you see the reason why
It hurts me so to know you've said goodbye
Can't you see the reason why
I feel the way I do for you inside

You make it so hard for me sometimes
I don't think I'll get you off my mind
But I'll try, so baby goodbye
Bye bye baby

Can't you see the reason why
If love meant life to me, I'd never die
Can't you see the reason why
You mean more to me than just goodbye

You've been with me so long it seems
And now you're in someone elses dreams
Well I tried, baby I tried

Can't you see the reason why
I walked in, I sat right down and cried
Can't you see the reason why
I looked at you and knew it meant goodbye

You said that you loved me once before
And now you don't love me anymore
Well I tried, so baby goodbye
Bye bye baby, yeah
