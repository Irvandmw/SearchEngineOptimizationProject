Lyrics:


let's leave town on a permanent vacation, lock up the house, pack up the station wagon, make
paradise our final destination, as long as we're outta here

There ain't no time like the present they say, let's cruise all the way down A1A, put the top
down, and catch a few rays, baby we'll be outta here

Any where you want to go, as long as its sunny weather, let the time fly by i don't mind, as
long as we're together

South of the border there's a place i know where James Taylor sang about Mexico and the suns
so hot we'll forget to go home, baby we'll be outta here

Any where you want to go as long as its sunny weather, let the time fly by, i don't mind, as
long we're together

Baby drive through the county down to the lake, see if the catfish are jumping set out bait,
and if we come up dry we'll just sleep in late, at least we'll  be outta here

As long as we're outta here, baby let's get outta here

Outta here

Come on baby let's get outta here, cruise down A1A, hang out in key west a little while
