Lyrics:


All that's left are memories of what used to be, hmmm
And what hurts is knowing
How much you really loved me
I didn't understand
Each time you held onto my hand
You were the kind of a girl
Who'd need so much love, so much love

And I should have loved you more
I should have loved you more
I should've given you all of the love
That was burning inside of me
Then you'd be here today

Baby all I do is think about you, hmmm
I don't know if I can make it without you
Losing you has made me wise
Though it's to late, I realise
My one big mistake was I didn't give
I could only take

And I should have loved you more
I should have loved you more
I should've given you all of the love
That was burning inside of me
Then you'd be here today

I should have loved you more
I should have loved you more
I should have loved you more
