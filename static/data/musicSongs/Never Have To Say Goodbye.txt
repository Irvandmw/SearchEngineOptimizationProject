Song Name: Never Have To Say Goodbye
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I never had a chance to say what I needed to say
Cause when you took your last breath
I was high â I was running away

You'd always call me on the phone but I'd never pick up
I never wanted you to know I was running out of luck
You didn't walk out â you didn't give up on me

So even if you're gone then I'm not giving up on you

We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just want to say that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you said is true
Then I will never have to call on you
In every single way â you're with me every day
So we never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

I didn't have the strength that I needed at the end of the day
Cause I was poppin' every pill the only one that I was foolin' was me
You always loved me when I couldn't even love myself
No you never turned away when I was begging for help
I should've said thanks for never giving up on me

So even if you're gone then I'm not giving up on you

We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just want to say that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you said is true
Then I will never have to call on you
In every single way â you're with me every day
So we never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

I can hear your voice when I walk through the pain
You showed me how to live, showed me that I could change
I can feel you catch me when I fall away

We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just want to say that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you said is true
Then I will never have to call on you
In every single way â you're with me every day
So we never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye
