Lyrics:


Hey yeah yeah, whoa yeah, whoa oh yeah

Well everybody got an opinion now, don't they?
But it ain't no thing to me
it really don't make any difference now to me
if you don't like what you see
I pay no mind to the negative kind
cause it's just no way to be
I don't stop to please someone else's needs
Gonna live my life for me

I'm gonna keep on, gonna do my own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
and no matter what people say, or might think
I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
And I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay

I'm here to stay
Whoa oh oh yeah (I'm here to stay)
Whoa oh oh yeah (I'm here to stay)

I've never been the type to be shy
I know that some would say I'm too headstrong
But Iâd rather be a woman who voices her mind
Whether you think I'm right or wrong

And I know some people wanna criticize
Makes them feel better about themselves
So say what you will
Time will reveal
In the end that I will be here still

I'm gonna keep on I'm a do my own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say, or might think
I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
Cause I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay

Gotta get up
Keep my head up
Gonna keep on turnin it up, never let up
If I keep steppin it up, I'm  a prove that
I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not
Gotta get up
Keep my head up
Gonna keep on turnin it up, never let up
If I keep steppin it up, I'm a prove that I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not

Woah woah woah

No matter the pressures that face me
I believe, I believe that we'll see
I'll never let anyone break me
All your doubt can do now is strengthen me

And life, it ain't always that easy
Gotta fight to see past the boundaries
Crossin' the lines I will define
Every time
That forever is mine

I'm gonna keep on, I'm a do my own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say, or might think
I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
Cause I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay
I'm gonna get bold, I'm a do my own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say, or might think
I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
Coz I aint going no place, no I'm here to stay
