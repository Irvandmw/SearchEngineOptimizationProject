Lyrics:


I wanna go to the riverbank
Right down the road, we'll take it slow
If I can get my truck to crank
I wanna lay with you there in the sand
Yeah, it oughta be fun layin' in the sun
Working on my farmer's tan

And we can be beach bums for a while
Naw, we don't even need palm trees
'Cause that's just a matter of style
And we can get away from everything
Yeah it's gonna be just you and me
When the weekend comes
And we can be beach bums

When it gets hot, let's take a dip
I'll be baptized by your angel eyes
And I'll taste heaven on your lips
We might pack a tent and spend the night
I'll play your favorite song as you sing along
Right there in the firelight

And we can be beach bums for a while
Naw, we don't even need palm trees
'Cause that's just a matter of style
And we can get away from everything
Yeah it's gonna be just you and me
When the weekend comes
And we can be beach bums

No I don't need no ocean breeze
I got the river and you here with me

And we can be beach bums for a while
Naw, we don't even need palm trees
'Cause that's just a matter of style
And we can get away from everything
Yeah it's gonna be just you and me
When the weekend comes
And we can be beach bums for a while
Naw, we don't even need palm trees
'Cause that's just a matter of style
We oughtta get away from everything
Yeah it's gonna be just you and me
When the weekend comes
And we can be beach bums

Beach bums

We can be beach bums
