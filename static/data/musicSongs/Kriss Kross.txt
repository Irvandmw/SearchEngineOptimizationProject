[Chris Brown:]
VVS protect all in my wrist watch
Got it jump, jumpin' like I'm Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girls, let 'em Kriss Kross
Drippin' water, I forgot to turn my wrist off
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girls, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross

Hoe I'm flossin', tell your bitch get off
Hit it once and had her feelin' nauseous
She pop that pussy, put that pressure on her
I got a lot of freaks that live in Arizona
Now I'm seein' things, sippin' on gasoline
Poppin' the Xan, I got the soda and the promethazine
Five in the mornin', keep me up like soldiers
She say she wanted a OG, like hold up baby,
there's more of us, you know I'm a nasty nigga

VVS protect all in my wrist watch
Got it jump, jumpin' like I'm Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girls, let 'em Kriss Kross
Drippin' water, I forgot to turn my wrist off
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girls, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross

[Luvaboy TJ:]
Reachin' for my .40 yeah, I'mma catch a charge
Don't make my chopper bark, I'm a fuckin' dog
We could take it to the yard or firearms
All my niggas, we go dumb, bomb it like Sudan
Get it straight, now I can't relate
Most you niggas fake, tryna infiltrate
Got gold golds at the gate
Grab 'em up quick, toss 'em in the lake
Got that goyard on my bezzels
Goyard on my wrizzle
Your bitch, she can't resist
Assist me for some interest

[Chris Brown:]
VVS protect all in my wrist watch
Got it jump, jumpin' like I'm Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girls, let 'em Kriss Kross
Drippin' water, I forgot to turn my wrist off
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girls, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross

[Young Blacc:]
Get killed if they crossin' me
They sprayin' so much, swear that they losin' me
We drippin' in saucey
Don't fuck with you niggas that be on that broke shit
Rap niggas, I expose 'em
Strapped up like a soldier
Phone calls, yeah a big homie
Gettin' packed, I was on another
I'm chuckin' in Phantom
I'm doin' 100, the same for the ransom
Hear they good with them cameras
We be takin' that shit, everyone put your hands up
OHB, that's the mob, nigga
Black out, do the job, nigga
Out of town with a passport
On Sunset, you get robbed nigga, I mean that

[Chris Brown:]
VVS protect all in my wrist watch
Got it jump, jumpin' like I'm Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girls, let 'em Kriss Kross
Drippin' water, I forgot to turn my wrist off
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
She gon' bring her girls, let 'em Kriss Kross
All that goyard, let 'em Kriss Kross
