Lyrics:


On a picnic morning,
Without a warning,
I looked at you,
And somehow I knew...

It must have been moonglow,
Way up in the blue,
It must have been moonglow,
That led me straight to you...

I still hear you sayin'
Dear heart hold me fast,
And I start in prayin'
Oh lord, please let this last,
We... seem to float right through the air,

Heavenly songs seem to come from everywhere,
An' now when there's moonglow,
Way up in the blue,
I always remember,
That moonglow gave me you...

You and I in the sunshine,
We strolled the fields and far,
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere,
And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue,
I always remember,
That moonglow gave me you,
That moonglow gave me you,
That moonglow gave me you...
