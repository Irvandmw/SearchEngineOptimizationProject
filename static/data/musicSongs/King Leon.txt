Lyrics:


Lets go,
Well alright, well alright,
Look,

Uh, feeling sorry for the runner up,
Iâm still awake getting money while the sun is up,
and they keep saying how they need me to deliver
cos they hate it when the rookie star doesnât put the numbers up,
Man, hate is so passe, catch me anytime for a suit on draft day,
nigga and itâs just me and my money,
ya donât even get to play when yaâll leading by 20,
yeah I infiltrated the game,
i was hesitant at first and fear what it would change,
now Iâm high off the success and faded off of the fame,
and still managed to keep all of my opinions the same,
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here,
hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear,
I want it all man, I never learned how to share,
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires,
wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit,
shout out to my niggas I just made a couple million with,
yeah from the beginning to the end,
know Iâm into making history not into making friends,
muthafuckerâ¦.
