Lyrics:


Rose is late for tea
She's been making mischief
Naughty as can be
She's been making mischief
When will papa see?
She's been making mischief in the schoolyard
Rose is pinching skin
Making all the boys cry
She is kicking shins
Making all the boys cry
Papa can't see it
She's is making boys cry in the schoolyard

Rose, Rose
Rose, Rose

Rose is throwing stones
Making all the girls scream
Rose is breaking bones
Taking all their ice cream
Papa doesn't know
The havoc she is reeking in the schoolyard

Rose, Rose
Rose, Rose

Rose is on her own
No one wants to play now
Rose is all alone
Pushed everyone away out
Only Rose is gone
Papa sees her sitting in the schoolyard
Rose is papa's seeds
She misses mama sadly
This flower's growing weak
No mama to hold hands with
Rose falls to her knees
She lets a tear fall softly in the schoolyard
