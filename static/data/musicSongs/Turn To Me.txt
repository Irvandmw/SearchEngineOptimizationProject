Lyrics:


If ever you need warm fan affection love and protection turn to me
If ever you want someone who's tender darling remember turn to me
Whenever you find the life's got you down I'll be around
Any time night or day I'm only your phone call away
I waited for you a half of my lifetime but I'll wait a lifetime
If that's how it must be till you turn to me
(If ever you need warm fan affection love and protection) turn to me
(If ever you want someone who's tender darling remember) turn to me
Whenever you find the life's got you down...
