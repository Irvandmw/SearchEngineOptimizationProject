Lyrics:


Your the right one
Yes, the right one
I have never been so sure
Of any one before

Your the first time
And the last time
You're the one time
They'll be no more

You're the star that always seems so far
But darling here you are
For all the world to see
So if you love me
Say you love me
For I know you're the right one for me

You're the star that always seems so far
But darling here you are
For all the world to see
So if you love me
Say you love me
For I know you're the right one
For me
