Lyrics:


OoohOooh 
Oooh ooh ohh yeah 
Ohh no 
Yeah.. 

Shorty ain't got cable, 
She don't even got a radio, way more than able. 
What kinda girl should I take her for? 
The perfect kind, just what I like, 
exactly what I had in my mind, a dream... 
She's a dream... yeah.. 

Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night. 
And when I'm outta town to go and do work, 
I'm first class every flight. 
If she takes the time to open her eyes, 
she can realize that she's a dream... 
cause she knows me... 

Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity, 
cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree. 
cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP. 
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me... 
That's why I make her say... Ooh 
Make her say... Aaah 
Make her say... Uhhh 
Make her say... Aaahh 

Shorty don't know who I am... 

And I'm cool with that, if she says so 
I even got a lot to her 
And when I'm out making pesos? 
Aint' nobody treat her like I do her. 
Cause I'm the one that she thinks about, 
The only one on her mind, 
She's a dream... 
cause she knows me... 

Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage, 
like 3 or 4 times a week 
she don't even know I've been around the world 
and all the different girls and me. 
But there's just one, face that I see 
She's the only one for me 
She's a dream.. 
cause she knows me.... 
Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity, 
cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree. 
cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP. 
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me... 
That's why I make her say... Ooh 
Make her say... Aaah 
Make her say... Uhhh 
Make her say... Aaahh 

See, shorty don't know who I am 
That's not good for us, cause I know, 
it's not good to fuss 
And I know she loves me, for me 
and i love her, for her 
but It wouldn't work if she ever gave 
a damn 'bout who I am but she knows me 

she don't know I'm a celebrity, 
cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree. 
cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP. 
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me... 
Uuuuuh 
Make her say... Aaah 
Make her say... Uhhh 
Make her say... Aaahh 

bout me...
