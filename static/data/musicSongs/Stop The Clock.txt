Lyrics:


Mmm
Mmm
Whoa-oh, mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Whoa-oh

Did it take you a minute to realise that I'm deep in it?
'Cause it feels like hours, I've been stuck here thinking
I get down, down on my knees
Begging, begging, please
Every single prayer's wasted in the air

It's like the hands of time (Oh-oh)
Have put handcuffs on mine (Oh-oh)
And nothing about this is holy
It's just killing me, killing me slowly
And I'm not ready yet (Oh-oh)
But I'm running outta breath (Oh-oh)
And all I can do is watch
'Cause I can't find a way
To stop the clock

Mmm
Mmm
Whoa-oh, mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Whoa-oh

I hear that long, black train, it's running outta track
And I'm no coward but right now, I got no powers
On no more you and me
We all get eulogies
But most of them, I swear, are wasted in the air

It's like the hands of time (Oh-oh)
Have put handcuffs on mine (Oh-oh)
And nothing about this is holy
It's just killing me, killing me slowly
And I'm not ready yet (Oh-oh)
But I'm running outta breath (Oh-oh)
And all I can do is watch
'Cause I can't find a way

I can't find a way to stop the hourglass now (Ooh, ooh)
Sand just slips away and life goes way too fast

It's like the hands of time (Keep taking away from me)
Have put handcuffs on mine (They'll never set me free)
And nothing about this is holy
It's just killing me, killing me slowly
And I'm not ready yet (I don't want you to leave)
But I'm running outta breath (One step ahead of me)
And all I can do is watch
But I can't find a way
To stop the clock
