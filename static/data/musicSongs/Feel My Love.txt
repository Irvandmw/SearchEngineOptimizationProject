Lyrics:


Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud

Well, hey there shawty with the big, brown eyes
I know you got something that I really do like
If you rock with me, I can make you mine tonight, tonight

My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone

Asking what I do isn't any of your business
Looking at my crew like you're something you fit in with
I don't even know if you thinking what I'm thinking
But I'm thinking 'bout your body, would you lay down for a minute?

Well, hey there shawty with the big, brown eyes
I know you got something that I really do like
If you rock with me, I can make you mine tonight, tonight

Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud

My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone

Is there an essence to the problem
If you ask me, I can solve them
If you need me, then I need you
And there's more than I can take than this love could be
More than amazement, more than entertainment
And if you need me [?]

My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
