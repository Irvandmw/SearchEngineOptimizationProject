Lyrics:


I love Corrina, tell the world I do
I love Corrina, yes, tell the world I do
I pray each night she loves me too
(Corrine, Corrina, Corrine, Corrina, Corrine, Corrina) I love you so

Oh little darling, now where you've been so long
Yeh, little darling where you've been so long
There's been no loving since you've been gone
(Corrine, Corrina, Corrine, Corrina, Corrine, Corrina) I love ya so

I left Corrina way across the sea (Across the sea)
I left Corrina way across the sea (Across the sea)
If you see Corrina send her home to me
(Corrine, Corrina, Corrine, Corrina, Corrine, Corrina) I love ya so
(Corrine, Corrina, Corrine, Corrina, Corrine, Corrina) I love you so
(I love you so)
