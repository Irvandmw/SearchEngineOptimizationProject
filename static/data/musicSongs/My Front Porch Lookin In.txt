Song Name: My Front Porch Lookin In
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Ooh yea woo, yeah, oh yea

The only ground I ever owned was sticking to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I could sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung

My blessings are in front of me it's not about the land
I'll never beat the view from my front porch looking in

[Chorus:]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue-eyed blonde
With shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most is my front porch looking in

Yeah, yeah

I've travelled here and everywhere
Following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air
Brushed by the hand of god
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one he made for me

'Cause anywhere I'll ever go and everywhere I've been
Nothin' takes my breath away like my front porch looking in

[Chorus]

I see what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out

[Chorus]

There's a carrot top that can barely walk
(from my front porch looking in)
A little blue-eyed blonde
With shoes on wrong
(from my front porch looking in)
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Ooh, yeah
