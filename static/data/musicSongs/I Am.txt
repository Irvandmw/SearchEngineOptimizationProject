Lyrics:


Before there was anything at all, He was
Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall, He was

Why?
Because, because, because, because
And I heard him say
Beside myself, no other, I am
And uh, no mother, no sister, no brother
Only I am
Because, I can, I can, I can, I can

Oh-oh!

I don't need to see, touch and feel (feel) desire, 
Everything in me will now be real a fire
A fire, a fire, my desire
Lightning struck when the painting began

When it was over, there stood a man
Amen, oh yes
A man, a man, a man, a man

Alright, oh!
Oh-oh!
Come on!
Look out now
Amen, amen, amen
Oh-oh!
