Lyrics:


(Wella, wella, wella, wella, wella, ....)

Well the coffee's too weak
Ant the steak is too strong
And I got an idea
I've been single too long, too long, too long
Wella, wella, wella the coffee's too weak, steak is too strong
Got an idea I been single too long
I ain't gonna lead this life no more
Sweet Jean
I ain't gonna lead this life no more

Well I'm washing my shirts
And mending my socks
And the hotel bed
Is stuffed with rocks, them rocks, them rocks
Wella, wella, wella, I'm washing my shirts
Mending my socks
The hotel bed is stuffed with rocks
I ain't gonna lead this life no more
Sweet Jean
I ain't gonna lead this life no more

Well a beautiful gal
Makes a beautiful bride
We'll be leaving that church
Marching side by side by side by side
Wella wella wella beautiful gal
Beautiful bride
Leaving that church side by side
I ain't gonna lead this life no more, Sweet Jean
Ain't gonna lead this life no more
