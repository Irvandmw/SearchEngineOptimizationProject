Lyrics:


Baby, if your dream is forty acres and a house
Porch going all the way around
I'mma buy it
Or if you'd rather see
City lights and a crowd
I'mma move you uptown
It don't matter to me
Nah, it don't girl
Baby, I can see me livin' anywhere with you so

Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place

If all you wanna wear is faded blue jeans and a tee
Oh baby, that's fine with me
You look good in anything
Aw, but girl I swear
If you wanna hit the town in a dress, turn a few heads
I ain't gonna stop you
Baby, I got you, oh

Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place

Every night (every night)
And every day
You're my everything
Til we fade away

Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place

Til we're both in a better place
