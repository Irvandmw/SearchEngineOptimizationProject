Lyrics:


All the love you give to me is so warm and gentle
When you kiss me my whole body tremble
You made me realize a real love can do
Oh oh oh, when you're making love to me

Come on and love me forever, never never let me go
Oh baby now, baby now, oh baby now, yeah
Love me forever, carry me away from home
Ooh, and I won't tell nobody if you do
Shut up bone, I really won't let you
Shut up bone, I really won't let you

I enjoy when I think of ours
Else of what your love has done from me
I was looking for someone to raise it
Who will make me dance to a different beat

Come on and love me forever, never never let me go
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh ooh ooh
Love me forever, carry me away from home
Oh, and I won't tell nobody if you do

I enjoy when I think of ours
Else of what your love has done from me
I was looking for someone to raise it
Who will make me dance to a different beat

Come on and love me forever, never never let me go
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Love me forever, carry me away from home
Oh, and I won't tell nobody if you do
Shut up bone, oh oh yeah, ya ya, well

Love me forever
Al you gotta do, all you gotta do, all you gotta do
Love me forever
