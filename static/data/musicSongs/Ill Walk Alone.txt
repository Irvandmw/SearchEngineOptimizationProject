Lyrics:


I'll walk alone, because to tell you the truth, I'll be lonely
I don't mind being lonely
When my heart tells me you are lonely too

I'll walk alone, they'll ask me why and I'll tell them I'd rather
There are dreams I must gather
Dreams we talked of the night you held me tight

I'll always be near you wherever you are each night
In every prayer
If you call I'll hear you, no matter how far
Just close your eyes and I'll be there

Please walk alone and send your love and your kisses to guide me
'Til you're walking beside me, I'll walk alone

I'll always be near you wherever you are each night
In every prayer
If you call I'll hear you, no matter how far
Just close your eyes and I'll be there

Please walk alone and send your love and your kisses to guide me
'Til you're walking beside me, I'll walk alone
