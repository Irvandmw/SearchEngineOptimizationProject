Lyrics:


Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand

Down these streets the fools rule
There's no freedom or self respect
A knife's point or a trip to the joint
Is about all you can expect

They kill people here who stand up for their rights
The system's just too damned corrupt
It's always the same, the name of the game
Is who do you know higher up

Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand

The blacks and the whites
Steal the other kids' lives
Wealth is a filthy rag
So erotic so unpatriotic
So wrapped up in the American flag

The witchcraft scum exploiting the dumb
Turns children into crooks and slaves
Whose heroes and healers are real stoned dealers
Who should be put in their graves

Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand

Listen to me Mr. Pusherman
This might be your last night in a bed so soft
There are pimps on the make, politicians on the take
You can't pay us off

We're gonna blow up your home of Voodoo
And watch it burn without any regret
We got the power, we're the new government
You just don't know it yet

Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand

For all of my brothers from Vietnam
And my uncles from World War II
I've got to say that it's countdown time now
We're gonna do what the law should do

And for you pretty baby
I know your story is too painful to share
One day though you'll be talking in your sleep
And when you do, I wanna be there

Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand
Band of the hand
