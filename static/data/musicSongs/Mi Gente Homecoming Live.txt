Turn up, BeyoncÃ©, yuh
Turn up, BeyoncÃ©, yuh

Are y'all ready, Coachella?
I wanna see everybody from the front to the back

Jump, jump, yeah
Let me see you jump
Ladies and gentlemen
Please give it up for J Balvin

Yeah, yeah

Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza
Ya empezamos como es
Mi mÃºsica no discrimina a nadie
AsÃ­ que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo cÃ³mo los tiene
Hago mÃºsica que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mÃ­
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo cÃ³mo los tiene
Hago mÃºsica que entretiene
Mi mÃºsica los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila asÃ­, come on

They say my body stay wetter than the (Ocean)
And they say that Creole in my body's like a (Potion)
I can be a beast or I can give you (Emotion)
So please don't question my (Devotion)
