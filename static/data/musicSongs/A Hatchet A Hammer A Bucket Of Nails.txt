Lyrics:


A hatchet, a hammer, a bucket of nails 
an' all the wood I can find 
I'll build me a cabin on top of the hill 
got all the plans in my mind . . . 

Where the tree tops talk to the wind 
where the eagle flies 
I'll bring her to see it the minute I'm through 
won't she light up with surprise!  

A hatchet, a hammer, a bucket of nails 
an' just my two hands, but with some help from above 
The walls will start risin', the roof will go on 
the final touch will be love . . . 

Where the tree tops talk to the wind 
where the eagle flies 
The preacher will bless us as we hurry to 
our happy home in the skies . . .  

As soon as we're married,  
we're movin' in to 
our happy home in the skies . . .  

(A hatchet, a hammer, a bucket of nails . . .) 
Our happy home in the skies . . .
