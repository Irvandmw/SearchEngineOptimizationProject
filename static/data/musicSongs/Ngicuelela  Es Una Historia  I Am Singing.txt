Lyrics:


[Ngiculela]
[Zulu translation by Thoko Mdalose Hall]

Ngiculela ikusasa
Ngiyacula nao thando
Ngiyacula ngeliny' ilanga
Uthando luyobusa
Jikelele kulomhlaba wethu

[Es Una Historia]
[Spanish translation by Raymond Maldonado]

Es una historia de maÃ±ana
Es una historia de amor
Es una historia que amor reinarÃ¡
Por nuestro mundo
Es una historia de mi corazÃ³n

[I Am Singing]

There's songs to make you smile
There's songs to make you sad
But with a happy song to sing 
It never seems so bad
To me came this melody
So I've tried to put in words how I feel
Tomorrow will be for you and me

I am singing of tomorrow
I am singing of love
I am singing someday love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
I am singing of love from my heart

Let's all sing someday sweet love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
Let's start singing
Of love from our hearts
Let's start singing
Of love from our hearts
