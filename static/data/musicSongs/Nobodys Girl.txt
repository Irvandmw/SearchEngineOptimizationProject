Lyrics:


Battle worn, a little tossed and torn
Ready to deceive
Carefree as a summer's morn
What a tangled web she weaved

Nobody's girl
Living in her mixed up world
Out of the blue
Out of control (ah)
Nobody's girl
Caught up in her twisted world
Playing a game
Playing a role

She's nobody's girl
She's nobody's girl

You can make it real, you can make it right
If you're ready to believe
You can't see through all the truth and lies
You only see what you wanna see

Nobody's girl
Living in her mixed up world
Out of the blue
Out of control (ah)
Nobody's girl
Caught up in her twisted world
Playing a game
Playing a role

She's nobody's girl
She's nobody's girl
She's nobody's girl
She's nobody's girl
