Lyrics:


My love has gone away, quietly after hundred days
This is what's she has always said she won't stay for more than what she can repay

I can still hear her say that I'm not hearing tender play
The day she let me kiss her was a display, of love to those who she betray

How can I put someone to the test, when I thought I got the best?
Until the taste of bitterness then I regret but still I won't detest
The love I can't forget, like someone who has left

How can I leave someone for the rest when I'm facing the best?
Until the taste of treachery then I regret
But still I won't detest who I can never forget like someone I once met

I can still hear her say that I'm not hearing tender play
The day she let me kiss her was a display, of love to those who she betray

How can I put someone to the test, when I thought I got the best?
Until the taste of bitterness then I regret but still I won't detest
The love I can't forget, like someone who has left

How can I leave someone for the rest when I'm facing the best?
Until the taste of treachery then I regret
But still I won't detest who I can never forget like someone I once met

How can I put someone to the test, when I thought I got the best?
Until the taste of bitterness then I regret but still I won't detest
The love I can't forget, like someone who has left

How can I leave someone for the rest when I'm facing the best?
Until the taste of treachery then I regret
But still I won't detest who I can never forget like someone I once met
