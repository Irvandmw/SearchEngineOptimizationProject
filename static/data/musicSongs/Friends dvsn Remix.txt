[Justin Bieber:]
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)

[Justin Bieber:]
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good

So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?

[dvsn:]
Aw, yeah
Ooooooh
(Can we be friends?)
It's hard when everybody out there
Just assumes we're still together
I just ran into your cousin
And had to tell her that we wasn't
Me and all my other exes talk
Why can't we?
Guess that's something you never really liked 'bout me
I gotta be careful when I text you
'Cause "LOL"s turn into "I miss you"s
Been told to keep it 100
I lost you and found myself wondering

[Justin Bieber & dvsn;]
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
