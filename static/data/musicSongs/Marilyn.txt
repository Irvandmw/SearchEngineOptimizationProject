Lyrics:


I met a boy on Sunset Boulevard
And fell in love on the avenue of the stars
He was a playboy, I tamed his heart
Cause I got what he wants, I got what he wants, hey

He loved the [?] laid upon my lips
He put his hands all around my curvy hips
"Love you forever", that's what he says
I'm the only one he wants, hey

Cause I comb my hair like Marilyn, Marilyn
I got the body like Marilyn, Marilyn
Don't got no fears like Marilyn, Marilyn
Yeah, I'm a hottie like Marilyn, Marilyn
So I say, "eyo, let the wind blow my skirt high"
Eyo, I got the candy cotton love like Marilyn, Marilyn
Yeah, I'm a hottie like Marilyn, Marilyn

We take a drive to the clear blue Pacific Coast
Not a [?] with the sand in between my toes
White bikini with polka dots
[?] no one gets 'em high, no one gets 'em high, hey

He loved the [?] laid upon my lips
He put his hands all around my curvy hips
"Love you forever", that's what he says
I'm the only one he wants, hey

Cause I comb my hair like Marilyn, Marilyn
I got the body like Marilyn, Marilyn
Don't got no fears like Marilyn, Marilyn
Yeah, I'm a hottie like Marilyn, Marilyn
So I say, "eyo, let the wind blow my skirt high"
Eyo, I got the candy cotton love like Marilyn, Marilyn
Yeah, I'm a hottie like Marilyn, Marilyn

Eyo, eyo
Eyo, eyo
Eyo, eyo
Eyo, eyo

I comb my hair like Marilyn, Marilyn
I got the body like Marilyn, Marilyn
Don't got no fears like Marilyn, Marilyn
Yeah, I'm a hottie like Marilyn, Marilyn
So I say, "eyo, let the wind blow my skirt high"
Eyo, I got the candy cotton love like Marilyn, Marilyn
Yeah, I'm a hottie like Marilyn, Marilyn
I comb my hair like Marilyn, Marilyn
I got the body like Marilyn, Marilyn
Don't got no fears like Marilyn, Marilyn
Yeah, I'm a hottie like Marilyn, Marilyn
