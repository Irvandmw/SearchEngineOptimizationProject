Lyrics:


Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isnt any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I find that day by day youre making all my dreams come true
And (so) come what may I want you to know
I'm (that I am) yours alone, and I'm in love (in love) to stay
As we go through the years day by day

(I said, day by day)
(As we go through the years day by day)
