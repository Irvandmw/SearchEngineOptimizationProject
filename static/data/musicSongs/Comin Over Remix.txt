[DaBaby & DJ Luke Nasty:]
Hey, hey

Girl, you know I'm on the way
Yeah, yeah

[DaBaby:]
Call my phone, I'm comin' over
Girl, you know I'ma do you right (Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring)
You know we put on a show, girl
You might as well keep on the lights (Might as well keep on the lights)
She do her thing, I be like, "Go, girl"
We can do this shit all night (Do your thing, do your thing)
I ain't to proud to let you know, girl
I'll sing this shit all night (I'll sing this shit all night)
She do her thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
I do my thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
Uh, hey

Whatever she with, then I'm with it (Hey)
Chokin' her out with the pillow (Uh)
We playin' hide and go get it (Ayy)
I ain't had that thing in a minute (Ayy)
She told me, "Let's get on the floor" (The floor)
I told her, "You already know" (You know)
Chokin' her out by her throat
Around and around and she go (Hey)
She tryna give me the business (The business)
I'm tryna get in her kidneys (Her kidneys)
Pullin' out all her extensions (Come here)
That pussy so good, it gon' kill me (Woo)
You know, I'm tryna keep you a secret (Shh)
As long as you promise to keep it
I'm only in town for the weekend

Call my phone, I'm comin' over
Girl, you know I'ma do you right (Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring)
You know we put on a show, girl
You might as well keep on the lights (Might as well keep on the lights)
She do her thing, I be like, "Go, girl"
We can do this shit all night (Do your thing, do your thing)
I ain't to proud to let you know, girl
I'll sing this shit all night (I'll sing this shit all night)
She do her thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
I do my thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
Uh, hey

[DJ Luke Nasty:]
It like threesome on one (Woo)
Wanna do somethin' with that long tongue (Yeah)
Wanna eat that cat from the back
Girl, just don't get attached
Doin' 80 in a 60 on my face
Whenever she comin', she don't ever use no brakes
Pentouse suite, my shit is sweet like crÃªpes (Woo)
Flow outta the Norman, that's why we on the lake
Tell me what it takes, don't tell me how it tastes
I just landed in Charlotte, girl, you know I'm on the way

[DaBaby:]
Call my phone, I'm comin' over
Girl, you know I'ma do you right (Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring)
You know we put on a show, girl
You might as well keep on the lights (Might as well keep on the lights)
She do her thing, I be like, "Go, girl"
We can do this shit all night (Do your thing, do your thing)
I ain't to proud to let you know, girl
I'll sing this shit all night (I'll sing this shit all night)
She do her thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
I do my thing, I be like, "Yeah, yeah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do your thing, do your thing)
Uh, hey
