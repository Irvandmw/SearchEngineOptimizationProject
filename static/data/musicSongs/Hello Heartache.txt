Lyrics:


La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

You were perfect
I was unpredictable
It was more than worth it
But not too sensible

Young and foolish
that seemed to be the way
And I was stupid
To think that I could stay
Oh oh
To think that I could stay

Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
Itâs not the end
Itâs not the same
Wish it didnât have to be this way but
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache

La la la la la la la
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la

I was champagne
You were Jameson
Every bad thing
We did was so much fun

I've seen your best side
You got to see my worst
Itâs not the first time
But this one really hurts
Oh, oh, yeah, this oneâs gonnaâ¦ it hurts

Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
Itâs not the end
Itâs not the same
Wish it didnât have to be this way but
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Do you know? Do you get it?
Itâs just goodbye, itâs not the end
Do you know? Do you get?
Itâs just goodbye, itâs not the end

Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
Itâs not the end
Itâs not the same
Wish it didnât have to be this way but
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache

La la la la la la la
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la

Wish it didnât have to be this way but
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache

La la la la la la la
