Lyrics:


I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna lie
I don't wanna tear you apart
I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna lie
I told you right from the start

Since we got a moment to talk
Why don't we just sit right down
Or we can take a little walk
Around the town
You were always good to me
My friends would say you treated me fine
But there's something you just can't see
And now it's time
But baby

I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna lie
I don't wanna tear you apart
I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna lie
I told you right from the start

I don't wanna cause you pain
Everytime I have to go
But the road is always calling my name
To another show
Oh, baby

I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna lie
I don't wanna tear you apart
I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna lie
I told you right from the start

Oh, eh
I don't wanna lie to you
Ooh, ooh
I don't wanna lie to you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I don't wanna lie to you
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey
I don't wanna lie to you, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna lie to you, woohoo
