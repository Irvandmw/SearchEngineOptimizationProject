Lyrics:


She squeezed the handle, topped the tank off
Pulled out her necklace and kissed the cross

El Paso he waved, horizon off the hood
She's going through with something
He never thought she would

By now he's rolling over on his back
He ain't waking up
Not with all the liquors he's had

She'll be halfway to Longview by the time he starts to stir
By the time he opens his eyes she'll already be a blur

You go girl, get in that Cadillac
There ain't no lie in looking back

She tore outta that station
Dust and gravel flying
Sideswiped a couple of highway signs
Tore off both mirrors
Something free and wild
Yeah, seems like ages but there's that smile
That long lost smile

Staring through the windshield
A new look in her eyes
A conscience as clear as the Texas sky

She ran out of patience, out of strength
And out of tears
He ran out of second chances
And now she's outta here

You go girl, don't look back
And there ain't no lie in living like that

She tore outta that station
Dust and gravel flying
Sideswiped a couple of highway signs
Tore off both mirrors
Something free and wild
Yeah, seems like ages but there's that smile
That long lost smile, tthat long lost smile
Yeah, you go girl, you go girl
Hey, you go girl
You go girl
