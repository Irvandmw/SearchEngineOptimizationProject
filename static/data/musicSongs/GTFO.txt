Lyrics:


How about you
How about you

You took my love for granted
You left me lost and disenchanted
Bulldozed my heart as if you planned it
My prince was so unjustly handsome

Who was a knight in shining armor
I got a story, you'll love me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr

How about you get the fuck out?
How about you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out
How about you take your things and be on your merry way?
Fly off with a wink, bye bye, baby
How about you scuse me, let me call your valet
You just take your things and be on your merry way

My friends are sordid in your eyes
They told me once, they told me twice
I looked beyond all the signs
I guess fool's love makes you blind, I

Who was a knight in shining armor
(You, you, you)
I got a story, you'll love me harder
(You, you, you)
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
(You, you, you)
I ain't the type to play the martyr

How about you get the fuck out? How about...
How about you get the fuck out?
How about... get the fuck out?
How about you take your things and be on your merry way?
How about you... Fly off with a wink, bye bye, baby
How about you scuse me, let me call your valet
How about you... take your things and be on your merry way?
How about you get the fuck out?
Fuck out, fuck out

Stop telling me these lies when you're bluffing
How about you get the fuck out?
Go stay at your friend's house or something
Don't mean to be rude but take your shit and leave
How about you
Go and stay at your friend's house or something
How about you
Go and stay with your homeboys you was talking to
How about you
I ain't tryna be rude, but you're lucky
How about you
I ain't kicked your ass out last weekend
How about you
Just take your things and be on your merry way
How about you
Fly off with a wink, bye bye, baby
