Lyrics:


Surrounded with only noise
I seem to tune it out
I just wanna hear your voice
And you need to say it loud
They can't distract me from our love
(Once I'm in, I'm fully in)
Giving a fraction ain't enough, no, whoa

Wanna get between so they can be someone, whoa
Tryna intervene 'cause they don't have no one (no one)

Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa...
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya...

Everybody wanna be something
Everybody wanna find their love
If you believe in something then you can get enough
Everybody wanna be something
Everybody wanna find their love
If you believe in something then you can get enough

Wanna get between so they can be someone
Tryna intervene 'cause they don't have no one (no one)

Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa...
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya...

Everyone wanna be something
Everybody wanna find their love
If you believe in something then you can get enough (oh, whoa)
Yea ya, yea ya
Yea ya, yea ya
