Lyrics:


Don't give your love away
'Cause girl, I give a fuck about you
Oh, don't let go of your heart
Gotta let go of the pain you feel
Pain you feel
'Cause I know what's in your heart
In your heart

Yeah, yeah
This the same old bullshit
Yeah, yeah
This the same damn thing (Thing)
Grabbin' on your body tryna get you loose
You done make mistakes, but I
Who making love, girl? I see the truth
It's the best, I got you rolling eyes
In the back of the head now
You think that I'm a thug nigga
Misery loves company
So I'ma stay with you
You're playing hard to get
Damn, like girl, you won't forget
More liquor with no niggas
Up in my crib with no extras
No clothes, just your necklace
Work it out, I bowflex it
And I hope that you gon' stay long
Roleplay, just play along

Baby, just keep them heels on, yeah
I hope you ready for them body shots
You been playing dumb with me all night
It's time to give it to me, girl, all you got

Don't give your love away
'Cause girl, I give a fuck about you
Oh, don't let go of your heart
Gotta let go of the pain you feel
Pain you feel
'Cause I know what's in your heart
In your heart
