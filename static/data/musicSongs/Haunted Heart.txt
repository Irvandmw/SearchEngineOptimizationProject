Lyrics:


There's no ground when you fall for me
You'll be falling for miles
I'm bewitched by your misery (ha-ha)
But I love it when you smile
Let me know what you want from me
Whisper low in my ears
Before you try to get your hooks in me
I should warn you, my dear

My heart is a haunted house
Once you're in you ain't getting out
It's the trap you've been waiting for
Ain't no windows, ain't no doors
No escaping the way you feel
It's like a dream but you hope it's real
My, my, my heart
M-m-m-m-m-my heart
Is a haunted... haunted house!

Watch your step when you walk to me
Careful where your heart treads
Suddenly you'll be in too deep
You'll be caught up in my web
You will think of me constantly
It'll drive you insane, mmh
Like the tattoo you can't remove
Like the blood in your veins

My heart is a haunted house
Once you're in you ain't getting out
It's the trap you've been waiting for
Ain't no windows, ain't no doors
No escaping the way you feel
It's like a dream but you hope it's real
My, my, my heart
M-m-m-m-m-my heart
Is a haunted... haunted house!
It's a haunted house!
