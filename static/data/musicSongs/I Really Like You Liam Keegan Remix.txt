Lyrics:


I really wanna stop
But I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I need to tell you something [x5]
But I need to tell you something
Do you want me too? [x3]

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by thread, baby

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
Do you want me?
Do you want me too? [x2]

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them?
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something

(YEAAAAAAH!) I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you (Oh, oh, ohh!)
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? 
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
