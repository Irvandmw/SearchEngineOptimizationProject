Lyrics:


(Alright)
(HÃ¸yere)

Sometimes it's harder to go home alone
Sometimes it's harder to make it on your own
But there's one thing I know
Trees will not grow on sand

Sometimes it's easier to go home alone
Sometimes it's easier just to know you've gotta make it on your own
But there's one thing I know
Trees will not grow on sand

On sand, yeah
On sand

Come on all over, baby
We were meant to be, yeah
You may not realize it yet
But I shall make you see
'Cause there's one thing I know
Trees will not grow on sand

One thing I know
Trees will not grow on sand
Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Oooooooh... yeah...
