Lyrics:


[Khalid & Jessie Reyez:]
Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Why is it always televised, they want me desensitized
I won't do it, I won't do it, mhm

[Shawn Mendes, Khalid & Jessie Reyez:]
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You have died inside, and your soul's not worth the price
Don't you lose it, for this foolishness, no
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away (can't take my youth)
You can't take my youth away
Oh, yeah

How come certain boys in blue
Can be so quick to shoot
You gotta be the change that you want to see
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
You gotta be the heaven you want to see
No, I won't let it change me (ooh)

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (youth away)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (oh yeah)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today (oh, oh)
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
