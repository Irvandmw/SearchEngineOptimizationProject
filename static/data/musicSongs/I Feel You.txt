Lyrics:


[Nelly:] Hey Esthero!
[Esthero:] Yeah?

[Esthero:] Hey, Nelstar!

[Nelly]
I want to know where you go
I want to know where you go
At night, when you leave my bed
And, when I saw you wandering is when I knew
You had no time for me left in your life
So I'm gonna hold my baby blown away, blown away
So goodbye

But I feel you
(Don't want to let you go)
I feel you
(Hey man I love you so)
I feel you
(Alone here in the night)
I feel you

If you want you can try
And you can make it right

[Esthero]
Oh you are such a little child
Oh you are such a little child
And you won't give anything away
No way, no way, no oh

And when I saw you wandering
When I saw you creeping is when I knew
You had no time for me in your life
Bo boo-hoo, now you're gone

But I feel you
(Don't want to let you go)
I feel you
(Hey man I love you so)
I feel you
(Alone here in the night)
I feel you ooh ooh ooh

It's not too late to catch me while you can
I will be waiting for you
You know it's not too late
It's not too late
Oh baby went away
I wish he could have stayed here
But, it's not too late

'Cause I feel you
(Don't want to let you go)
I feel you
(Hey man I love you so)
I feel you
(I long you in the night)
I feel you you you you (yeah)
