Lyrics:


Born on the isle of pain
It's easy to find others to blame
We used to be gagged and bound
And we ain't, no we ain't turnin' round

To get to the promised land
You got to go back to understand
Everything comes from sound
All vibrating under the crown
And we ain't, no, we ain't turnin' round

Ran out of patince yesterday for them with no helpin' hands
We came from a people who built everything and farmed the land
Let's stop looking for a reason to die and just sound the alarm
Maybe the hand you're looking for is at the end of your arms
End of your arms, end of your arms
