Lyrics:


So soft and slow
Never knew a girl could be so god damn cold
I know
The way she move got me spending my dough
And yo
If you would've seen what I seen on that pole
Just know

That I was wrong for falling in love
I was wrong for falling in love
(They always say, "Don't love a whore.")
Say I was wrong for falling in love
(Don't do it yo)
I was wrong for falling in love
(They always say, "Don't love a whore.")
But I just went against the grain

It was a feeling I can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singing in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
Singing in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day

Look at me, I'm stuck
That bubble in her pants got me caught up
I never had no luck
Thinking with the wrong head
Got me jumping out there with no glove
It feels so good, had me sprung out
All messed up, now I'm stuck

That's what I get for falling in love
That's what I get for falling in love
(They always say, "Don't love a whore.")
That's what I get for falling in love
(Don't do it yo)
That's what I get for falling in love
(They always say, "Don't love a whore.")
But I just went against the grain

It was a feeling I can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singing in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
Singing in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day

So thick, so raw
That oil all over her body stole my heart
I'm caught
The way she drop down won't allow me to close my jaws
'Cause I'm already in love
And I knew better from the start
Oh, no

I was wrong for falling in love
I was wrong for falling in love
(They always say, "Don't love a whore.")
I was wrong for falling in love
(Don't do it yo)
I was wrong for falling in love
(They always say, "Don't love a whore.")

But I just went against the grain
It was a feeling I can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singing in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
Singing in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day

It was a feeling I can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singing in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
Singing in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
