Bitch wanna roast me
Cuz I got a xbox one
I don't even have no games
All I play is GTA
My nigga got Franklin dick
Livin in a franklin crib
I'ma get frank lil bitch
Why you on my frank like this
Bitch I'm annual flossing
VVS
Yeah I play Animal Crossing
Gamecube, 3DS
I ain't ever been poor
Used to play Sims 4
Put a lil wall round niggas
Take the door off, trap em in the swimmin pool

I don't play Fortnite fuck that
Chun-Li when I street Fight
Bust back
You ain't got combos whats that
Rock bitches on Mortal Kombat
It's tricky to rock a rhyme
Merk bitches on SSX
Leave bitches all bald like Seeiah
Mic check em like test test test
I remember my downward spiral
Back when I was playin Spyro
When I never went out n lied low
Way before my lil ass went viral

Super Smash Bros
You so ass though
Prolly pick Kirby
So you don't get smashed on!

Shake that ass hoe [x4]
Can I get a hell yeah?

Can I get a hell yeah?
(Fight!)
Can I get a hell yeah, yeaaaah?
(Nigga)
Can I get a hell yeaaaah?
Can, can, can, can, can, can, can...
(Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I...)

Can I get a hell yeah?
(Fight!)
Can I get a hell... yeah?
(Nigga)
Can I get a hell... yeah?
Can I get a hell... yeah?
(Yeah, yeah)

Master of my craft never played Minecraft
Look how my mind crafts things
Be on my halo tings
Look at my sonic rings
Ahooga don't push me
I hadouken
Hear the "toasty"?
Donkey Kong when he drum on that pussy
I don't play but I sure ain't no rookie
Steal a nigga like a bandit, boo
Then spend every penny of his bands and loot
Now she think that I'm the devil like a bandicoot
Wawawawawawa what u wanna do?

Yo, Can I get it, get it yah

(Oh yeahhh!)
Can I get a hell yeah, yeah, yeah?

Can I get a hell yeah, yeah, yeah?
(Yeah yeahhh!)
Can I get a hell... yeah?
