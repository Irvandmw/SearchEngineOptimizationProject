Lyrics:


The world is ours, whatever we want it to be
Pour it down all over me
I'm lost, I'm found, I hold you like a mystery
I'll meet you where no one else can see

It's like my heartbeat's poundin' right out of my chest
Yeah, like my heartbeat's got me all out of breath
And baby, this right here's about as good as it gets
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh

And this love
And this love is
And this love is
Limitless

You let go when I was holding on too tight
You put the colorin' to black and white, mmh

It's like my heartbeat's poundin' right out of my chest
Yeah, like my heartbeat's got me all out of breath
And baby, this right here's about as good as it gets
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh

And this love
And this love is
And this love is
Limitless

Limitless
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh
It's limitless

The world is ours, whatever we want it to be
Pour it down all over me
