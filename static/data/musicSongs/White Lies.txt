Lyrics:


White lies, white lies

Every word you say haunts me in my brain like a ghost, like a ghost
Every word you say violates what we've already known, I should go
Why do you light these fires around my heart and soul?
Every word you say is a sewer main ready to blow, I should know

With all of your white lies, white lies
With all of your white lies, all of your white lies
With all of your white lies

You keep talking about your new intentions
You keep telling me that you're gonna change
But every word is your new invention
But your words don't mean a thing

I got myself out walking over the ledge on a wire
I got myself into the frying pan from the fire
I got my number in over my head this time
When I think about you

And all of your white lies, white lies
With all of your white lies, all of your white lies
With all of your white lies

You had my heart and my soul, and you sold it
You had my heart and my soul, and you sold it
You had my heart and my soul, and you sold it
You had my heart and my soul, 'cause you stole it
You had my heart and my soul, and you sold it
You had my heart and my soul, and you sold it

For all of your white lies, white lies
With all of your white lies, all of your white lies
With all of your white lies
