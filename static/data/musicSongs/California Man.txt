Lyrics:


Going to a party meet me on after-school
Yeah we're going to a place where the jive is really cool
And if the band stops playing there's a jukebox in the hall
I got my blue dress on and my folks are gone and we're gonna have a ball

So get that real guitar boy shaken
He's a California man
Dance right on till the floors are breaking
He's a California man
Well he rocks his mama so bad
My baby, he's making me mad
And he don't care if my legs start aching
'Cause he's a California man

Well my legs start to shiver when I hear him call my name
And my knees keep a knocking and his bow tie is busting out
His feet start to fly and his jeans slung way down low
And when he's tapping his heels it's making him feel like the king of Rock n' Roll

So get that real guitar boy shaken
He's a California man
Dance right on till the floors are breaking
He's a California man
Well he rocks his mama so bad
My baby, he's making me mad
So he don't care if my legs start aching
'Cause he's a California man
Yeah, he's my California man

Go, baby, go, baby, go, baby, go

Well we're going to a party meet me on after-school
You know we're going to a place where the jive is really cool
And if the band stops playing there's a jukebox down the hall
I got my blue dress on and my folks are gone and we're gonna have a ball

So get that real guitar boy shaken
He's a California man
Dance right on till the floors are breaking
He's a California man
Well he rocks his mama so bad
My baby, he's making me mad
And he don't care if my legs start aching
'Cause he's a California man
Yeah, he's my California man
