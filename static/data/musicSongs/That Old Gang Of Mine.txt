Lyrics:


Gee but I'd give the world to see that old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartet that sang Sweet Adeline

Goodbye forever old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever old sweethearts and pals
God Bless them
Gee but I'd give the world to see that old old gang of mine

(Gee but I'd give the world to see that old gang of mine)
I can't forget that old quartet that sang Sweet Adeline

Goodbye forever old fellows and gals...
