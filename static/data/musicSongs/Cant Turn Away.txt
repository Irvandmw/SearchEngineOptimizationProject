Lyrics:


I can't run, can't turn away now

It's all the same, nothing ever changes
The long days, the ten cent raises
A few bucks in my pocket's gotta go a long way
22, got my whole life ahead of me
But still, lettin' life get the best of me
Gotta stop, and just leave it up to destiny now
I don't know how much more of this I can handle
But I know that good things come to those who wait

I can't run, can't turn away now

Four years, I've been out of high school
Forget college, thinking I was so cool
But no regrets, gotta do what you gotta do
My heart, it's in love with the rock 'n' roll
And playing music is all that I really know
You know love, it's the only thing you can't control

Can't stop believing/no matter how long it takes
It might kill me to keep on dreaming
But I'd rather die than throw it away
I don't know how much more of this I can handle
But I know that good things come to those who wait
And better things will come to those who don't give up
So mine should be coming any day

I can't run, can't turn away now
