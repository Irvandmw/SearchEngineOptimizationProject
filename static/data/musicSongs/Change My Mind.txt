Lyrics:
Lyrics:


We were bold
We were dust
We were energy
We were more in the light than we'd ever be
Effortless dancing with symmetry
And the memory's more or less killing me

All of my sirens
Running to your fire
Don't fight it

Change my mind
Make me drown for you again
Take the time
Got you wonderin' where I've been
Are you ever gonna change my mind?
(Are you ever) change my mind
I've been waiting for you, change my mind
(Are you ever) change my mind

Change my name
Chain the words to my dying day
But I just seem to keep pushing you away
And it's all I can do as an optimist
To look out on the shore for our lonely ship

All of my sirens
Running to your fire
Can't fight it

Change my mind
Make me drown for you again
Take the time
Got you wonderin' where I've been
Are you ever gonna change my mind?
(Are you ever) change my mind
I've been waiting for you, change my mind
(Are you ever) change my mind

Change my mind (are you ever)
Make me drown for you again
(Are you ever)
(Are you ever)
(Are you ever)
Change my mind (are you ever)
Make me drown for you again
Are you ever?
Are you ever?

We were bold
We were dust
We were energy
We were more in the light than we'd ever be
