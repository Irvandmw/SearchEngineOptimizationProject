Lyrics:


You come over to tell me that it's over
Say you want to do this face to face
Bottle opens we pour out our emotions
Knew that if you came here you would stay

If you want closure
Come on and close that door
I know, know, know
What ya' really came for
If you want closure
Come on and close that door
I know, know, know
What ya' really came for
I know what ya' want, baby
What ya' really came for
Closure
I know what ya' want, baby
Know what ya' came here for
Closure

How did we end up in this situation
Guess it went exactly as you planned
I always give in to your manipulation
I tried to resist but I just can't

If you want closure
Come on and close that door
I know, know, know
What ya' really came for
If you want closure
Come on and close that door
I know, know, know
What ya' really came for
I know what ya' want, baby
What ya' really came for
Closure
I know what ya' want, baby
Know what ya' came here for
Closure

Oh as soon as we make love
It's gonna break your heart again
Cause we both know when we wake up
That we'll go back to war again

If you want closure
Come on and close that door
I know, know, know
What ya' really came for
If you want closure
Come on and close that door
I know, know, know
What ya' really came for
I know what ya' want, baby
What ya' really came for
Closure
I know what ya' want, baby
Know what ya' came here for
Closure
