Lyrics:


How could this affect my life?
How could I affect the outcome?
So why even try?
For what, for what, for what, for what?
A coward can save the day
When the bravest of men just stand by
So easy to say
So what, so what, so what

So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored?
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?

A candle's the smallest light
But a handful becomes a lighthouse
Cutting the night
For us, for us, for us, for us
The one with the loudest voice
Is rarely the one to follow
Silence the noise
So what, so what, so what

So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored?
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?

Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
What if we, what if we, what if we

So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored?
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?

Hurry up, the world needs this
Hurry up, the world needs this
