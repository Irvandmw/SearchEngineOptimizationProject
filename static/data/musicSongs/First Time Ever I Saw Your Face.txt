Lyrics:


The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and empty skies, my love

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt your heart beat close to mine
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was ther at my command, my love

The first time ever I saw your face, your face,
Your face, your face
