Lyrics:


Play it hard, make it soft, make it sound kinda sleazy
Put it in, take it off, no one said it was easy
Number one, I don't know, better get her direction
Here it comes, there it goes, didn't pass his inspection

Be yourself, take a chance, we know you can do it
Have a weird rubber pants, number ten with a bullet
Good words, wrong song, don't try to seduce her
Sounds great, hold on, think you need a producer
No way that punk rock can set you free
Put your mind at ease

Call it what you want, it's alright
It's rock 'n roll to me
Call it what you want, it's alright
It's rock 'n roll to me
It's rock 'n roll to me

Real bad, pay your dues, save the tuition
Take a chance, bye bye, shouldn't make a decision
My friends they arrive, rent a house on the ocean
Go to lunch, outta sight, we were talkin' promotion
No way that punk rock can set you free
Put your mind at ease

Call it what you want, it's alright
It's rock 'n roll to me
Call it what you want, it's alright
It's rock 'n roll to me
It's rock 'n roll to me
