Lyrics:


Well if you can't be my lovin' baby, you ain't got the style
I'm gonna get some real darn love that will drive the cool cat wild

I wanna move, move on down the line
Yeah I wanna get some loving and love that's truly fine

Yeah I wanna move on down the line
I wanna get some love that's truly fine
She'll be cool and do me wrong, she'll be cool and twice as gone
We're gonna roll on, roll on down the line
Aww, I wanna do right, do right all the time

Yeah I'm gonna move on down the line
I wanna get some love that's truly fine
She'll be cool and do me wrong
She'll be cool and twice as gone
We're gonna roll on, roll on down the line
Aww, I wanna do right, do right all the time

Yeah!

Mmm, I'm gonna show it ain't so hot, I'm gonna get what you ain't got
She'll be cool and do me wrong, she'll be cool and twice as gone
We're gonna roll, on roll on down the line
Yeah I wanna do right, do right all the time

Well I wanna move on down the line
I wanna get some love that's truly fine
She'll be cool and do me wrong, she'll be cool and twice as gone
We're gonna roll on, roll on down the line
Aww I wanna do right, do right all the time
Yeah I wanna do right, do right all the time
