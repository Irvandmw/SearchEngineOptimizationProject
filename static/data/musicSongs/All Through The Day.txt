Lyrics:


All through the day, I dream about the night 
I dream about the night here with you 
All through the day, I wish away the time 
Until the time when I'm here with you 

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you 
The evening mist melts away! 
Down smiles the moon, and soon your lips recall 
The kiss I dreamed of, all through the day! 

[instrumental break]

All through the day, I wish away the time 
Until the time when I'm here with you 

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you 
The evening mist melts away! 
And down smiles the moon, and soon your lips recall 
The kiss I dreamed of, all through the day!
