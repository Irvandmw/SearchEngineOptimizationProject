Lyrics:


I like how you are
And how you're still my friend
And although it's been so long
I'm wondering
If you can tell me
Tell me how you
How you stay so pure and sure
Can I tell you
Tell you how I
How I feel, feel for you

I know in time
You'll still be by my side
And I know that I
I don't have to think
Twice about who you are
Yes, I know
I know that you are mine
You're mine, you're mine
You're my sweet, sweetie pie

Well, I like how I can be
So open to you
And I know you understand
Just what I'm going through
And can I tell you
Tell you that I
I believe you're a true, a true friend
And I sure hope
Hope that I can
Keep this going 'til the end

And I know in time
You'll still be by my side
And I know that I
I don't have to think
Twice about who you are
Yes, I know
I know that you are mine
You're mine, you're mine
You're my sweet, sweetie pie

And even if the love don't show, I know
I know just how our feelings grow
We're friends forever
Yes, I know
We'll never let go

And I know in time
You'll still be by my side
And I know that I
I don't have to think
Twice about who you are
Yes, I know
I know that you are mine
You're mine, you're mine
You're my sweet, sweetie pie
