Lyrics:


Iâve never felt like I belonged
Iâve never fit in any place, been alone, until now
Been carryinâ a weight thatâs not my own
This leveeâs gonna break, and Iâm not sure I can hold on

And Iâm not sure, how long, I can, hold off this storm
Thereâs a, dark cloud, right overhead

Give it to me
Just give it to me, give it to me
Iâll take it all away, just give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me 
I'll take it all away, just give it to me 

I was taught I should stand up and be strong 
It turns out it was a truth I couldâve sent home, until now
I was born with a shotgun in my hand, Iâm not afraid of anything, but the dark, without you 

Iâm not sure, how long, I can, hold off this storm
Thereâs a, dark cloud, right overhead

Give it to me
Just give it to me, give it to me
Iâll take it all away, just give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me

Give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
Just give it to me, give it to me 
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
