Lyrics:


I need someone, hey baby, let me love you
Please donât push me away
Let me in your life

I wasnât there when she hurt you
So why should I have to pay?
Baby, let me in your life

I want to share your tomorrow
So I must beg, beg you for today
And if sheâs the cause of your sorrow
Be glad that sheâs gone away

I need someone let me love you
Please donât push me away
Baby, let me in your life

I wasnât there when she hurt you
So why should I have to pay?
Baby, let me in your life, yeah

Cause I, I want to share your tomorrow
And so, and so I must beg, beg you for today
And if sheâs the cause of your sorrow
Be glad that sheâs gone away, yeah

Let me in your life, come on baby
Let me in your life, na na na, baby
Let me in your life, ah ah ah, baby
Let me in your life, yeah, baby
Let me in your life, ah ah, baby
Let me in your life, yeah, baby
