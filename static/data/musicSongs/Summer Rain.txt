Lyrics:


My summer rain

I prepared for the worst in a storm
It doesn't take long before I'm shaking
I watch the news end, wait for the forecast
I fill a tall glass, try to be patient
It's been a long time, I feel my temperature rise
You might be moving too fast, oh
Wait for the sirens, sit in the silence
I sit on my hands

I feel the breeze, feel the sea swelling and drowning me
I feel the night, feel the sunlight, I feel everything
I feel your love, and I'm done and I surrender now
I want whatever you've got so bring 'em, bring 'em down

I thought you were a hurricane
Turns out you were the summer rain
You came
To wash away all of my pain
I needed you in every way
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain

I was mistaken, but I feel safe here
So now we're making some kind of rainbow
The storm has broken, two words are spoken
And I am soaking in all your love so
Love me for all time, and feel my temperature rise
Thought you were moving too fast, oh
But I was just scared to let you into my head
And let you see my past

I feel the breeze, feel the sea swelling and drowning me
I feel the night, feel the sunlight, I feel everything
I feel your love, and I'm done and I surrender now
I want whatever you've got so bring 'em, bring 'em down

I thought you were a hurricane
Turns out you were the summer rain
You came
To wash away all of my pain
I needed you in every way
My summer rain

When you live in fear
You miss everything
I was struggling
When you stop fighting
The war within
Everybody wins

I thought you were a hurricane
Turns out you were the summer rain
You came
To wash away all of my pain
I needed you in every way
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
