Lyrics:


I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared

It was awesome
But we lost it
It's not possible
For me not to care

And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear
My dear

The 7 things I hate about you
The 7 things I hate about you (oh you)

You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy

Your friends they're jerks
When you act like them
Just know it hurts

I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now
Is your sincere apology

When you mean it
I'll believe it
If you text it
I'll delete it

Let's be clear
Oh I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here

The 7 things I hate about you

You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy

Your friends they're jerks
When you act like them
Just know it hurts

I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The 7 that I like

The 7 things I like about you

Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy

Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined
Everything's alright

I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
You do
