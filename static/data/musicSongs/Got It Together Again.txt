Lyrics:


Been out doing what we had to do
Now we got it together again
Been out doing what we had to do
Now we got it together again
(Whatcha been doing?)

I've been out working for girl named Sue
Oh, I've been doing what my dad told me to
You better

Been out doing what we had to do
Now we got it together again
Been out doing what we had to do
Now we got it together again
Been out doing what we had to do
Now we got it together again
(Guess what?)

I've been doing good, and I've been mean
And I've been looking for a coke machine

Been out doing what we had to do
Now we got it together again
Been out doing what we had to do
Now we got it together again

Well it's uh, it's about
Well folks it about the end of the album time
It's wish time, you've been such a good girl on the album and everything else and sang all the songs and didn't throw many rocks or anything like that and you get some wishes, you want some wishes?
Mmhmm
What do you want wishes?
I wish you'd tune your guitar
Uh well, next album
Next album?
Yeah
Okay, then I wish I wish um we can do another album
That's not a bad wish, I wish that whoever it is up there in a big guitar land in the sky would give Howdy Doody back to the people, I miss Howdy
I do too, I remember him
Sing a little bit for me
It's Howdy Doody time (oh yeah)
It's Howdy Doody time (That's good, I like Howdy Doody)
You know what I wish?
I wish that um that we'd quit getting so old
(Tsk, tsk, tsk) Well we're the oldest, no I won't even say it
(Teeny boppers?) Yeah (In the world?)
Mmhmm ('72?)
72? (Yeah)
No that's the next album (No if you add us together)
How old are you? (What?)
How old are you? (Well the time this is out I'll be 42)
42? (Right)
And I'm 30 (Right, that's 72 any way you add that up)
I think that's awful, it's good (It's good, what to be, what any other wishes?)
Wishes? Um, babies (You want some babies)
Mmhmm you have two right? (Yeah I have two)
I want some (Babies? I've got two giants)
Yeah Mark and Debbie (Pretty giants)
Yeah pretty pretty (And uh any other)
Um I wish everybody would be quiet and nice (And don't through rocks)
Yeah (Don't shoot guns)
Right? (And come home safe)
Right (Cause we miss you)
Yeah

(Nancy? Are we through) Mmhmm
(Can I go back to Sweden?) Oh alright partner bye
