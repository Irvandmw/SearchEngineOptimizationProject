Lyrics:


Say, waiter, would you kindly stop, take my order please
Tonight I'm full of emptiness and old-time memories
So I need somethin' special that'll chase the blues away
And help me to forget about the dreams of yesterday

Just bring me one, one cup of happiness and one peace of mind
I'll take the biggest slice of life that you can find
I think that's all I'm gonna need to leave the blues behind
One cup of happiness and one peace of mind

Say, Waiter, I just thought of somethin' that I've never tried
I'd like to have a little bit of heaven on my side

You know it may sound funny, but when I was passin' by
The sign up in your window is the thing that caught my eye
I don't recall exactly, but I do believe it said
We guarantee to satisfy, so you go right ahead

And bring me one cup of happiness and one peace of mind
I'll take the biggest slice of life that you can find
I think that's all I'm gonna need to leave the blues behind
One cup of happiness and one peace of mind

I hope that's all I'm gonna need to leave the blues behind
One cup of happiness and one, one peace of mind
