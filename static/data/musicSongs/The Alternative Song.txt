Lyrics:


Hi

Donât you know that every song starts with an intro,
Quiet âtil the middle then picks up and moves on,
Donât you know that every song starts with an intro,
Quiet âtil the middle then picks up and moves on..

[Chorus]
And it goes on and on and on and on,
And it goes on and on and on and on,
And it goes on and on and on and on,
And it goes on, yeah yeah yeah..

Make sure your guitars are loud,
Loud enough to move the crowd,
And feedback is essential,
So that my voice is smooth and clean like,
The channel on your amp before you scream,
Words like, yeah letâs rock-n-roll

[Bridge]
And it goes one mississippi,
Two mississippi,
Three mississippi,
Four, [x2]

[Chorus]

Letâs rock-n-roll,
Letâs rock-n-roll,
Letâs rock-n-roll,
And it goes,
Letâs jump around,
Letâs jump around,
Letâs jump around,
And it goesâ¦ [x2]

[Chorus]

Câmon!
