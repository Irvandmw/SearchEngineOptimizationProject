Lyrics:


The world as I see it, is a remarkable place
A beautiful house in a forest, of stars in outer space
From a birds eye view, I can see it has a well-rounded personality
From a birds eye view, I can see we are family

Itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, itâs not a difficult thing
Itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Because you are the world to me

Yeah the world as I see it, is a remarkable place
Every man makes a difference and every motherâs child is a saint
From a birds eye view I can see, we are spiraling down in gravity
From a birds eye view I can see, you are just like me

Itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, itâs not a difficult thing
Itâs not hard for me to love you
Oh I really love you unconditionally
No, itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, itâs not a difficult thing
Itâs not hard for me to love you
Oh I really love you,
Love you are the world to me

You are the mountain, you are the rock
You are the cord and youâre the spark
You are the eagle, you are the lark
You are the world and youâre remarkable
Youâre the ocean eating the shore
You are the calm inside the storm
Youâre every emotion, you can endure
You are the world and the world is yours.

Itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, itâs not a difficult thing
No, itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you unconditionally
No, itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No, itâs not a difficult thing.
Itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you, because you are the world to me
No, itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No itâs not a difficult thing (No, itâs not a difficult thing)
Itâs not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you (really itâs not hard),
Because you are the world to me.
Yeah the world as I see it, is a remarkable place
