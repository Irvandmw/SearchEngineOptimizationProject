Lyrics:


Iâm tired of trying
I guess I walk instead of flying
These wings are broken
From carrying my mind
Iâm tired of lying
Because thereâs nothing I can do
I need a searchlight
To bring me back to you

Send me a searchlight
A fire in the sky to light my way
I need a searchlight
To bring me back to you tonight

My arms are tired
And thereâs no one else around
I need a savior
When this shipâs going down
Iâll breathe my last breath
Itâs gonna take a miracle this time
But I still believe that your still there
On my darkest nights

Send me a searchlight
A fire in the sky to light my way
I need a searchlight
To bring me back to you tonight

Send me a searchlight
A fire in the sky to light my way
I need a searchlight
To bring me back to you and let me know that Iâm all right

I feel lost inside this fog
I need your light to carry on
Iâve got nothing left to hide
I hope you want whatâs left behind

Send me a searchlight
A fire in the sky to light my way
I need a searchlight
To bring me back to you tonight

I need a searchlight
I need a searchlight
I need a searchlight
To bring me back to you and let me know Iâm all right

I need a searchlight
I need a searchlight
I need a searchlight
To bring me back to you and let me know Iâm all right
