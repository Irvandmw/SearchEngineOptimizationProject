Lyrics:


Itâs a pretty good day when you read the sports page
And your teams winningâ¨
Then you scan the obituaries and your name ainât in em
Itâs a pretty good day when you get to complain
That the sun ainât shinningâ¨
But you put on your shades anyway
Cause you know there's a silver lining

[Chorus:]
Hey hey hey
Itâs always a pretty good day
When I get to see your faceâ¨
Whenever I get to sayâ¨
That I love you and you say me too
And I know thatâs all I needâ¨
At the end of the day
Itâs a pretty good day to be me

Itâs a pretty good day when your out on the lake
And the fish ainât bitingâ¨
So you just set there and catch your shareâ¨of some piece and quite
Itâs a pretty good day when your on your wayâ¨
And you like where your goingâ¨
When you got what you want and you want what you got
And your wise enough to know it

[Chorus:]
Hey hey hey
Itâs always a pretty good day
When I get to see your faceâ¨
Whenever I get to sayâ¨
That I love you and you say me tooâ¨
And I know thatâs all I really needâ¨
At the end of the day itâs a pretty good day to be me

Itâs been a pretty good ride around the sunâ¨
Itâs been a pretty good day good week good month
Itâs been a pretty good yearâ¨
Iâm glad Iâm here
