Lyrics:


Oh! how I miss you tonight, 
Miss you while lights are low 
Oh! how I need you tonight, 
More than you'll ever know! 

Each moment though we're apart 
You're never out of my heart  
But I'd rather be lonely, and wait for you only  
Dear One, how I miss you tonight! 

[instrumental]

Miss you while lights are low 

[instrumental]

More than you'll ever know! 

Each moment though we're apart 
You're never out of my heart  
But I'd rather be lonely, and wait for you only  
Dear One, how I miss you tonight!
