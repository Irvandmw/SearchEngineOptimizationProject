Lyrics:


Grief and hope, they walk together
Live side by side but they're not friends
Grief and hope they help to carry us through
And when we see better days, they go separate ways

I knew a man who lost a lot
He was a man the world forgot
He had his share of pain and sorrow
But he had hope to face tomorrow

Grief and hope, they walk together
Live side by side but they're not friends
Grief and hope they help to carry us through
And when we see better days, they go separate ways

There'll be dark clouds across the sky
You may ask God the reason why
But while you're praying and while you're kneeling
Remember hope does all the healing

Grief and hope, they walk together
Live side by side but they're not friends
Grief and hope they help to carry us through
And when we see better days, they go separate ways

When darker forces rule the land
You still can have the upper hand
Grief will destroy you if you let it
But hope will help you to forget it

Grief and hope, they walk together
Live side by side but they're not friends
Grief and hope they help to carry us through
And when we see better days, they go separate ways
