Lyrics:


Ayy, you got 50?
Nah, nah, you don't change from that shit

Back to the back, took it up to the max
Where them niggas wanna' act like I'm not it?
Fuck do you mean? It was totin' the green
Nigga, whole flow soundin' hypnotic
She see me throw all the money in the club
Nigga, five thousand singles in the air now
I need to see a bad bitch in the corner
Ass in the air, with her hair down

I'm, goin' down the I-95, nigga, high
This is just the life that I want upside
She don't wanna' touch me, she busy with her pride
Her waist 21, but she really 25 (Grra)
Eyes closed now, she's trying to hide
Runnin' up the green, and she falls in the vibe
She wanna' ride the wave, but the wave too high (Too)
Doors go upside-down rightside
Lit niggas comin' through the front door (Woo, brrt)
I don't really think that you want us (Skrrt)
Backed up shooting like I'm Rondo (Hoo, hoo)
Way too lit to be humble

She Alabama ratchet, but she virgin tight(Shh)
She comes in the perfect height
You don't really gotta' keep searchin' wide (Brrt)
She doesn't come from a perfect life (Perfect life)
She Alabama ratchet, but she perfect right (Perfect right)
She comes in the perfect height (Perfect height)
Hoodrat chick in a serving size (Serving size)
She doesn't come from a perfect life
But she low key, low key freak, but it's real low (Ho)
I don't wanna do a whole lot of talkin' (Woah!)
Her ass this fat, keep your head in the pillow (Hey)
I'll help find you love in the mornin'
'Cause I ain't really tryna be nobody hero (Hey, hey)
Tryna buy a house on Zillow
Wanna be the brand new Will and Jada
But I ain't ready for a Willow
I know I really gotta' hope that she really open
A nigga goin' out of light, no with no promotion
I'm really, really, talkin' normally think I'm boastin'
This Ghetto Lenny but they treat me like I'm Michael Bolton
I could be the one, she the one for me (For me)
I don't care what she got underneath
I ain't really care if she got company (Company)
'Cause I'm a rich nigga with a company, yeah ('Scuse me)

Back to the back, took it up to the max
Where them niggas wanna' act like I'm not it?
Fuck do you mean? It was totin' the green
Nigga, whole flow soundin' hypnotic
She see me throw all the money in the club
Nigga, five thousand singles in the air now
I need to see a bad bitch in the corner
Ass in the air, with her hair down

I'm, goin' down the I-95, nigga, high
This is just the life that I want upside
She don't wanna' touch me, she busy with her pride
Her waist 21, but she really 25 (Grra)
Eyes closed now, she's trying to hide
Runnin' up the green, and she falls in the vibe
She wanna' ride the wave, but the wave too high (Too)
Doors go upside-down rightside
Lit niggas comin' through the front door (Woo, brrt)
I don't really think that you want us (Skrrt)
Backed up shooting like I'm Rondo (Hoo, hoo)
Way too lit to be humble
