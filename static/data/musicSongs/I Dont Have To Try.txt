Lyrics:


I'm the one, I'm the one who knows the dance
I'm the one, I'm the one who's got the prance
I'm the one, I'm the one who wears the pants
I wear the pants
I'm the one who tells you what to do
You're the one, you're the one if I let you
I'm the one, I'm the one who wears the pants
I wear the pants

Hey you, follow me I'll take the lead
Can't you see
Don't you question me
You just do what I say

[Pre-chorus:]
I don't care what you're saying
I don't care what you're thinking
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm happening
I don't care what you're saying
I don't care what you're thinking
I don't care about anything
Get ready motherfucker cause I'm on the scene

[Chorus]
I don't have to try
To make you realize
Anything I wanna do, anything I'm gonna do
Anything I wanna do I do
And I don't have to try

Don't you disagree
Cause you know it's all about me
Be at my beck and call
I'm a know-it-all
And it's all your fault

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus X2]

Don't have to try
