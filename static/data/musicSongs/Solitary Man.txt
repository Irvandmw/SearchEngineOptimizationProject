Lyrics:


Belinda was mine
'Til the time
That I found her
Holdin' Jim
And lovin' him

Then Sue came along,
Loved me strong,
That's what I thought
Me and Sue,
But that died, too.

Don't know that I will
But until
I can find me
A girl who'll stay
And won't play
Games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man

I've had it to here
Being where
Love's a small word
A part-time thing
A paper ring

I know it's been done
Havin' one
Girl who loved me
Right or wrong
Weak or strong

Don't know that I will
But until
I can find me
The girl who'll stay
And won't play
Games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man

Don't know that I will
But until
Love can find me
And the girl who'll stay
And won't play
Games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man
Solitary man
