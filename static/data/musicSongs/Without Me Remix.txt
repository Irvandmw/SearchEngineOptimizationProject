[Juice WRLD:]
Ah-ah-ahh

[Halsey:]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Halsey (both):]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

[Halsey:]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Halsey (both):]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could (live without me)
Thinking you could (live without me)

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could (live without me)
(Live without me)
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Juice WRLD:]
I'm sad inside, but I know it's for the best, right?
You had to realize where you drew the line
I would cross the line a thousand times
You've got what I need, bae I need your spotlight
Along the lines of social suicide
I refuse to die
Not by your side
So I'll take what I can from you, then I'll hide
And save the lucid dreams for another time
I still hate it when you're not there
I know I should, I know I should, but no I don't care
I still hate it when you're not there
This life's not fair, took advantage up there

[Halsey (Juice WRLD) {Both}:]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there? (Ah-ahh)
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me (Life's not fair)
You know I'm the one who put you up there (Aye, aye, yeah)
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could {live without me}
Thinking you could {live without me}
Baby, I'm the one who {put you up there}
I don't know {why} (Yeah, I don't know why)
