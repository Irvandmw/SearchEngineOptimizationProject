Lyrics:


You know I've never felt like this before
Feels like so real

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of close enough
You got me stressing,
Incessantly pressing
The issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you

I'm the question
And you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy,
'Cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up,
Never mistaken,
But I can't control myself,
Got me calling out for help

S.O.S.! Please, someone, help me.
It's not healthy
For me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard?
I can't take it.
See, it don't feel right

S.O.S.! Please, someone, help me
It's not healthy
For me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin'.
Can't sleep at night

This time, please, someone, come and rescue me
'Cause you're on my mind. It's got me losing it
I'm lost. You got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me,
But still I'm losing it

This time, please, someone, come and rescue me
'Cause you're on my mind. It's got me losing it
I'm lost. You got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me,
So, now I'm losing it.

Just your presence,
And I second guess my sanity.
Yes, it's a lesson.
It's unfair. You stole my vanity.

My tummy's up in knots.
So when I see you I get so hot.
My common sense is out the door,
Can't seem to find the lock.

Take on meâuh, huhâyou know inside you feel it right
[CD version:] Take me on. I'm put desire up in your arms tonight
[Video version:] Take me on. I could just die up in your arms tonight.
I'm out with you. You got me head over heels
Boy, you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

S.O.S.! Please, someone, help me.
It's not healthy
For me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making (Y.O.U.) this hard?
You got me tossin' and turnin'.
Can't sleep at night

This time, please, someone, come and rescue me
'Cause you're on my mind. It's got me losing it
('Cause you're on my mind)
I'm lost. You got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me,
But still I'm losing it.

This time, please, someone, come and rescue me.
(someone, come and rescue me)
'Cause you're on my mind. It's got me losing it
I'm lost. You got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me,
So, now I'm losing it.

Boy, you know you got me feeling open.
And, boy, your love's enough with words unspoken.
I said, boy, I'm telling you, you got me open.
I don't know what to do.
It's true.
I'm going crazy over you.
I'm begging.

S.O.S.! Please, somebody, help me.
It's not healthy
For me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard?
(are you making this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossin' and turnin'.
I can't sleep at night

This time, please, someone, come and rescue me
(someone, rescue me)
'Cause you're on my mind. It's got me losing it
I'm lost. You got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me,
But still I'm losing it

This time, please, someone, come and rescue me
'Cause you're on my mind. It's got me losing it
('cause any time)
I'm lost. You got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me (best of me),
I'm losing it
