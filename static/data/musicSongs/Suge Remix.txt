Lyrics:


[Nicki Minaj & DaBaby:]
I had to do it (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Ha (Hm, hm)
Oh Lord, Jetson made another one (Rrrh, oo)

[DaBaby:]
Hah
Pack in the mail, it's gone (Uh)
She like how I smell, cologne (Yeah)
I just signed a deal, I'm on
Yeah, yeah
I go where I want, I'm good (Good)
Play if you want, let's do it (Ha)
I'm a young CEO, Suge (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah

[Nicki Minaj:]
Drug lord, Griselda, I used to move weight through Delta
So stay in your place 'cause I don't wanna put you in a shelter
I'm cookin' up in the kitchen, you could be my little helper
Go to the table and ask 'em do they want the flat or the seltzer?
I go where I want I'm good, my niggas'll get them goods
So come off the chain and come off the watch, you gotta respect the jux
Queen sleazy era and they never see me ever
'Cause I send my shooters and they introduce us as soon as I pull the lever (Brr)
I say "Choke me," he do it every time that we do it
Nigga packin' like Hewlett, I told him, "Damn, nigga, you lit"
On that D goin' stupid, got my ass-shots from Cupid
You could just ask Ken, he be like: "Hadouken!" (Rrrh)

[DaBaby:]
Hah
Pack in the mail, it's gone (Uh)
She like how I smell, cologne (Yeah)
I just signed a deal, I'm on
Yeah, yeah
I go where I want, I'm good (Good)
Play if you want, let's do it (Ha)
I'm a young CEO, Suge (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah

The first nigga play, I'ma body a nigga (Ha)
I just checked my balance
I'll probably pull up to your hood
And come buy me a nigga (No cap)
You know that your ho told you that nigga crazy
Don't think that she lied to you, nigga (Bitch)
Get caught with your ho when I'm poppin' 'em both
Now they high just like Bobby and Whitney (Haa)
Say I'm the goat, act like I don't know
But fuck it, I'm obviously winnin'
Don't make me go hit the bank and take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different (Ha)
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' (Uh)
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children (Ahh, ahh)
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million (I pop)
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you (Yeah)
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' (Kiddin')
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga (Hot, hot, hot)
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas (I don't)
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out guns, I'm gon' be done shot me a nigga (No cap)
I don't follow no bitches on IG
But all of your bitches, they follow a nigga (Ha)
And that lil' nigga ain't gon' shoot shit with that gun
He just pull it out in his pictures (Bitch, uh)

Hah
Pack in the mail, it's gone (Uh)
She like how I smell, cologne (Yeah)
I just signed a deal, I'm on
Yeah, yeah
I go where I want, I'm good (Good)
Play if you want, let's do it (Ha)
I'm a young CEO, Suge (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah
Hah
Pack in the mail, it's gone (Uh)
She like how I smell, cologne (Yeah)
I just signed a deal, I'm on
Yeah, yeah
I go where I want
I'm good (Good)
Play if you want, let's do it (Ha)
I'm a young CEO, Suge (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah
