Lyrics:


Come on over here, baby
Take my [?]
Alright
Won't you come down?

Where you go when you need good lovin'?
How will you know if love is very hard to find?
How you say
That you need it every day?
Well, if you look my way you won't be wastin' time.

Just come on over here
And I will take care
Of your every need
'Cause I've got love to give
To you
Just come on over here
And don't you worry, dear
'Cause I've got more
I've got more than you know what to do with

What you do when you're not satisfied
And when you've done all that you can?
You know you tried
And how you do you say
That you need to get away?
Don't make it so hard
When I'm there for you

Just come on over here
And I will take care
Of your every need
'Cause I've got love to give
To you
Just come on over here
And don't you worry, dear
'Cause I've got more
I've got more than you know what to do with

Boy, I know
That you've been through so much
Don't you think it's time to give it up?
You deserve love the way I do
And how I see it
It's you for me and me for you

Just come on over here
And I will take care
Of your every need
'Cause I've got love to give
To you
Just come over here
And don't you worry, dear
'Cause I've got more
I've got more than you know what to do with
