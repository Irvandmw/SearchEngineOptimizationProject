Lyrics:


Woke up at 5 am, put on my camouflage
Wiped off my .243 and fired up my dodge
Headed out to my old deerstand back in the pines
Gonna get me a ten point buck with 11 inch tines, yeah

Settled in, hiddin from the wind, waitin on the sun
You might end up being my supper if you get in the way of my gun
It's so still I can hear the train from ten miles away
If I'm here eight hours from now it'll be ok, yeah

Cause I'm a backwoods boy
Grew up on a dirt road
I'm a backwoods boy
With no better place to go
Waitin' on a deer, wishin' on a star
I'll always be true to my heart
Cause I'm a backwoods boy
I'm a backwoods boy

Sittin' on the back of Lynches 
River with a little campfire
Sleepin' on the ground, diggin'
The sound of a backwoods choir
Talkin to the man in the moon
Way up in the sky
He told me to let my worries
Roll on by

Cause I'm a backwoods boy
Grew up on a dirt road
I'm a backwoods boy
With no better place to go
Waitin' on a deer, wishin' on a star
I'll always be true to my heart
Cause I'm a backwoods boy
I'm a backwoods boy
