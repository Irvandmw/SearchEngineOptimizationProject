Lyrics:


I can't go on Instagram no more
That shit make me wanna die
I can't see another photograph
Paintin' the perfect lie, yeah
I'm so tired of feelin' paper-thin
Like I could tear at anytime
Trapped inside of the brain I'm in
Please get me out of my mind

Can anybody stop this train?
Take me back into my younger days
I was happy with the simple days
Who am I anymore?

Who am I anymore?
'Cause really, I don't know
All I wanted was to be something
To be something
But right now (But right now), I don't know (Know)
Who I am anymore
Don't have a fuckin' clue
I was hopin' I could be something
I could be something
But right now (But right now), I don't know (Know)
Yeah, yeah

Take a look in the mirror, I don't know who I've become
Please take me back to the days when I was young
I ain't had no purpose, only thing I had was fun
Now the only thing I feel inside of me is numb
I can't spend another second on my phone
I can't focus on your life, homie, tryna live my own, yeah
Yeah, I got some issues, tryna fight them all alone
But if I'm in here by myself, this house will never be a home

(Stop this train) Stop this train
(Younger days) Take me to my younger days
(Simple days) Pride's on the floor

Who am I anymore? (Who am I? Yeah)
'Cause really, I don't know (Really, baby, I don't know)
All I wanted was to be something
To be something
But right now (But right now), I don't know (Know)
Who I am anymore?
Don't have a fuckin' clue (I don't have a clue)
I was hopin' I could be something
I could be something
But right now (But right now), I don't know (Know)
