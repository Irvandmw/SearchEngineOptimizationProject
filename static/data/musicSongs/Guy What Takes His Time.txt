Lyrics:


Ooh, ooh, ooh

A guy what takes his time, Iâll go for any time
Iâm a fast movinâ gal who likes them slow
Got no use for fancy driving, wanna to see a guy arriving in low
Iâd be satisfied, electrified to know a guy what takes his time

A hurry-up affair, I always give the air
Wouldnât give any rushing gent a smile
I would go for any single who would condescend to linger awhile
What a lullaby would be supplied to have a guy who takes his time, ooh

A guy what takes his time, Iâd go for any time
A hasty job really spoils a masterâs touch
I donât like a big commotion, Iâm a demon for slow motion or such
Why should I deny that I would die to know a guy who takes his time

There isnât any fun in getting something done
If youâre rushed when you have to make the grade
I can spot an amateur, appreciate a connesseur in trade
Who would qualify, no alibi, to be the guy who takes his time

Ooh, oohâ¦
