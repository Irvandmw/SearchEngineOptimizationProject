Lyrics:


Your so understanding
Whenever I feel blue
Whenever I need someone
I always run to you

You're so understanding
Whenever things go wrong
If I have you to cling to
They're not that way for long

As long as you are near me
My cares are far away
Your smile can always cheer me
Your kiss your touch can do so much

Oh, you're so understanding
In everything that you do
And darling I will always
Be understanding too
