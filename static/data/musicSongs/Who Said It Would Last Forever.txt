Lyrics:


You say you've been hurt before
It's time you realized
The promises they never meant to keep
They're nothing more than lies

You can come to me with your problems
How he turned you on with his lines
There ain't no use in pretending
'Cause you know love is blind
Who hurt you this time
You're laying your heart on the line

Who said it would last forever
And he'd never break your heart
You should have known better
Lovers sometimes part

So baby stop crying
And wipe those teardrops from your eyes
It's time to get back on your feet again
Life's full of alibis

If I've told you once (once), I've told you twice (twice)
Said it a thousand times before
But you're so young and too innocent
You keep on coming back for more
Who hurt you this time
When you lay your heart on the line

Who said it would last forever
And he'd never break your heart
You should have known better
Cause lovers sometimes part

So hold your head up high
It's lonely in the dark
Let someone else try to mend your broken heart
To make a brand new start of things
And I would give you everything that you were missing

Who said it would last forever
And he'd never break your heart
You should have known better
Lovers sometimes part

Who said it would last forever
And he'd never break your heart
You should have known better
Lovers sometimes part

Who said it would last forever
Who said it would last forever
Who said it would last forever
