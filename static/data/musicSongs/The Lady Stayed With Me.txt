Lyrics:


Do you ever wonder where she is
Do you ever want to know
Did the lady's love stay with you
When you told her to go

Where did she go when you left her
And who is she thinking of
And do the lady's laughing eyes
Still look for love

Listen, the lady stayed with me this evening
The lady talked to me until dawn
The lady stayed with me and said
To tell you she's gone

Where did she run when you told her
And what did she have to say
And does the lady's love of life
Still get in your way

Well listen, the lady stayed with me this evening
The lady talked to me until dawn
The lady stayed with me and said
To tell you she's gone

Do you ever wonder where she is
Do you ever want to know
Did the lady's love stay with you
When you told her to go

Listen, the lady stayed with me this evening
The lady talked to me until dawn
The lady stayed with me and said
To tell you she's gone

The lady stayed with me this evening
The lady talked to me until dawn
The lady stayed with me and said
To tell you she's gone
