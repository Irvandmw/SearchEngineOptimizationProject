Lyrics:


Crash
That was you and me
Started out so innocently
Shattered on the ground
I hear the sound
Crash
Ringing in my ears
I still feel the sting of my tears
Someone wake me
I can't seem to break free

[Chorus]
Go on
Get out of my head
Iâm on the wrong side of a parallel universe
Am I alive or just dead
I've been stumbling in the dark
Living in a crash world

Hush
Donât say one more word
At this point the truth seems absurd
Cause who we were
Is gone forever

Crash
Underneath the fears
Everything's so twisted and weird
Someone save me
I canât seem to break free

[Chorus]
Go on
Get out of my head
Iâm on the wrong side of a parallel universe
Am I alive or just dead
I've been stumbling in the dark
Living in a crash world
[Other people] Crash world, yeah yeah

Slow motion
Devastation
Should'n seen it coming
But I couldnât do nothing
emotion
Desperation
Someone save me
I canât seem to break free

[Chorus]
Go on
Get out of my head
Iâm on the wrong side of a parallel universe
Am I alive or just dead
I've been stumbling in the dark
Living in a crash world
[Reapeat twice]

[Other people] say twice Crash world, yeah, yeah
