Lyrics:


Hit me

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (Hah, hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (Hah, hah)

If you can't make me say "ooh"
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some and you really want none?
If you can't make me say "ooh"
Like the beat of this groove
(You don't have no business in this)
(Here's your papers baby, you are dismissed)

Everybody give it up for the beautiful Kelly
And the beautiful Michelle (We love you)
My girl B is killing it tonight
I'm so happy y'all are here tonight
Do y'all remember this song?
