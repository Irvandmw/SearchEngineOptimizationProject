Ay, Royce he did it right here

I just hit a lick on your whole team (Yeah)
Mixing up a bean, now I'm rolling
If I go broke, no I'm going back to trapping
[?] so I went and bought a whole thing (Yeah, yeah)
I just hit a lick on your whole team (Yeah)
Mixing up a bean, now I'm rolling
If I go broke, no I'm going back to trapping (Trapping)
[?] so I went and bought a whole thing

Spanish bitch with me cause I'm up now
She just wanna call me cause I'm nice now
Cause I was [?] she don't want me
Started hitting states now she love me

Mixing up a bean, now I'm rolling
If I go broke, no I'm going back to trapping (Trapping)

I've been chasing money every day now
Catching flights, I'm headed to the bay now
Keep a .30, thats all up on my waist now
Pull up, and we set the whole place down

Mixing up a bean, now I'm rolling
If I go broke, no I'm going back to trapping
[?] so I went and bought a whole thing (Yeah yeah)
I just hit a lick on your whole team (Yeah)
Mixing up a bean, now I'm rolling
If I go broke, no I'm going back to trapping (Trapping)
[?] so I went and bought a whole thing
