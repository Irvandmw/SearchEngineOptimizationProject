Lyrics:


It gets hard tryna see through this revenue, baby
If you had it all, what you do with it? (With it)
You know I gotta tight grip on you, I ain't ever losing you (woah, woah, woah, no, no)
'Cause you've been down for a long time, there's no other love that I'm gon' find

For you, for you
Yeah, so let me make this clear, my love
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't going nowhere
There really ain't no exit for me (oh, oh nah)
There really ain't no exit for me (no, no)
I ain't worried 'bout the next chick
There really ain't no exit for me (no, no)

'Cause if I leave with you out the club (you know, you know)
The bad girls just don't do enough (you know, you know)
Take it all, you got my love (ooh)
I promise, girl, you got my love (you know, you know)
Baby, really ain't no exit (no)
There really ain't no exit, for me (for me)
I ain't looking for no exit (yeah, oh)
There really ain't no exit for me

So don't be worried by my ex chick, I know that you heard them stories (no, stories)
'Bout all them games we use to play, but that ain't me now, I'm different, babe (I'm different, babe)
All around the world in one day, so many different girls be on me (in one day, so many different girls be on me )
You know them bright lights be on me but you're the one for me, let's be honest

For you, for you
Yeah, so let me make this clear, my love (my love)
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't going nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
There really ain't no exit for me (oh, oh nah)
There really ain't no exit for me (no, no)
I ain't worried 'bout the next chick
There really ain't no exit for me (no, no)

'Cause if I leave with you out the club (you know, you know)
The bad girls just don't do enough (you know, you know)
Take it all, you got my love (ooh)
I promise, girl, you got my love (you know, you know)
Baby, really ain't no exit, huh
There really ain't no exit, for me (for me)
I ain't looking for no exit, oh
There really ain't no exit for me, oh

If you ride, I'ma ride with you
I don't wanna go nowhere, I don't wanna go, no
I'ma make it up, baby, now, I'ma make it up to you now
Make it up, baby, oh woah, ooh

'Cause if I leave with you out the club (you know, you know)
The bad girls just don't do enough (you know, you know)
Take it all, you got my love (ayy)
I promise, girl, you got my love (I promise, girl, you got my love, you know, you know)
Baby, really ain't no exit, huh (no, no exit)
There really ain't no exit, for me (for me)
I ain't looking for no exit, oh (yeah, ooh)
There really ain't no exit for me, oh (there really ain't no exit for me)

Yeah, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, ooh, woah
Woah, ooh
