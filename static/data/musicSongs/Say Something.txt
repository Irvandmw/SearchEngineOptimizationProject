Lyrics:


I was scared, I was unprepared
I was not aware you were caught in a bubble
You and I had a drunken fight
On a Tuesday night downtown

Well it cuts so deep when you try to speak
But the words don't come out right
You can lean on me when it's hard to breathe
You can call me anytime

So please
Say something to me
I'm down on my knees
Say something to me, say something
Say something to me

I would walk for ya, I would climb
Just to keep you safe and to keep you of trouble
I'd do time for you, I would lie for you
I would die for you

Well it cuts so deep when you try to speak
But the words don't come out right
You can lean on me when it's hard to breathe
You can call me anytime

So please
Say something to me
I'm down on my knees
Say something to me, say something
Say something to me

Well it cuts so deep when you try to speak
But the words don't come out right
You can lean on me when it's hard to breathe
You can call me anytime

So please
Say something to me
I'm down on my knees
Say something to me, say something
Say something to me

Say something to me
