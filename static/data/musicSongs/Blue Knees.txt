Lyrics:


Just 'cause I bought a band-aid
Doesn't mean I'm able to clean the scars
That run deeper
Than all my old demons
That I keep under still water

Just 'cause you give me flowers
Doesn't cover up the smell of a dead body
Or raise the dead body
Of a girl who got shut down before

Just 'cause you crack the window
Doesn't mean I'm able to clear the air
That made it hard to breathe 
Before you came around here

Just 'cause you say you love me
Doesn't mean that I'm gonna look you in the eyes
Pretend to be surprised
And say I love you back (love you back)

'Cause I'm tripping, tripping on rocks
Cuttin' on my ankles
Where I know the blood stops
Blue, blue knees
Fallin' for the next man who breathes

I need a band-aid recovery
Don't get too close 
'Cause you're really nothing to me
You're just a band-aid on my knees
You're just a band-aid recovery
I'll rip you off when I please
I'll rip you off when I please

Just 'cause I'm coming over
Doesn't mean I'll be there when you wake up
'Cause coming over doesn't mean that I'm over him

Just 'cause you are my band-aid
Doesn't mean I want you to stick around
'Cause rebounds get washed away the next time it rains

'Cause I'm tripping, tripping on rocks
Cuttin' on my ankles
Where I know the blood stops
Blue, blue knees
Fallin' for the next man who breathes

I need a band-aid recovery
Don't get too close 
'Cause you're really nothing to me
You're just a band-aid on my knees
You're just a band-aid recovery
I'll rip you off when I please
I'll rip you off when I please
