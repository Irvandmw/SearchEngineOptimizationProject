Lyrics:


Oh, hah, God
Ayy

I got right back in the bag
I got right back on my swag
I got right back to the cash
I got right back on they ass (Oh, yeah)
I'ma pull off, hit the gas (Le' go)
Then pull right back up, make 'em mad (Skrt)
Whenever I see 'em I laugh (Ha)
'Cause I got right back on they ass (Turn up)
I got right back on they ass (Turn up)
I got right back on they ass (Turn up)
I got right back on they ass (Oh, yeah)
I got right back on they ass (Oh, yeah)
I got right back on they ass (Turn up)
I got right back on they ass (Le' go)
I got right back to the cash (Hey)
And now I'm right back on they ass (Damn, okay)

You know that they comin' to Baby (Ok)
You know that my swag is so crazy (Oh yeah)
And you know that I'll bag your lil' lady (Bag it up)
And we might end up having a baby (Know how it go)
Didn't know that I had that much flavor
I gave out so much sauce to these lil' niggas I had to go put up a lil' but for later
I really don't wanna talk to these lil' niggas 'cause all they gon do is turn into some haters
I won't even do these lil' niggas a favor
Back on they ass, I couldn't tell you
Goddamn

I got right back in the bag
I got right back on my swag
I got right back to the cash
I got right back on they ass (Oh, yeah)
I'ma pull off, hit the gas (Le' go)
Then pull right back up, make 'em mad (Skrt)
Whenever I see 'em I laugh (Ha)
'Cause I got right back on they ass (Turn up)
I got right back on they ass (Turn up)
I got right back on they ass (Turn up)
I got right back on they ass (Oh, yeah)
I got right back on they ass (Oh, yeah)
I got right back on they ass (Turn up)
I got right back on they ass (Le' go)
I got right back to the cash (Hey)
And now I'm right back on they ass (Damn, okay)

Ayy
