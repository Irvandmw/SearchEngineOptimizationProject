Lyrics:


Beautiful, dirty, dirty, rich, rich, dirty, dirty beautiful dirty, rich
Dirty, dirty, rich, dirty, dirty, rich, beautiful
Beautiful and dirty, dirty, rich, rich

We've got a red light
Pornographic
Dance fight
Systematic
Honey
But we got no money

Our hair is perfect
While we're all getting shit-wrecked
It's automatic
Honey
But we got no money

Daddy I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry yeah
We just like to party, like to party yeah

Bang bang, we're beautiful and dirty, rich
Bang bang, we're beautiful and dirty, rich

We live a cute life
Sound fanatic
Pants tighter
Than plastic
Honey
But we got no money

We do the dance right
We have got it made like
Ice cream topped with honey
But we got no money

Daddy I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry yeah
We just like to party, like to party yeah

Bang bang, we're beautiful and dirty, rich
Bang bang, we're beautiful and dirty, rich

A bang bang bang, bang bang bang, beautiful, dirty, rich
A bang bang bang, bang bang bang, beautiful, dirty, rich

Bang bang, we're beautiful and dirty, rich
Bang bang, we're beautiful and dirty, rich

Bang bang

Bang bang
