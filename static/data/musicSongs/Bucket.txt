Lyrics:


I ran into a buddy used to be all hypertensive
His stocks were always tanking and his girlfriends were expensive
But he looked like a poster for a permanent vacation
I asked him what he did to change his orientation
He bought a shot and dropped this little information

I made a bucket list, changed the B to an F
I gave my give-a-damn the finger, so it got up and left
I quit worrying 'bout people's expectations
And ordered up a six-pack of chillaxification

If you're a little depressed, feel a little bit lost
Baby, write it all down, and then blow it all off
We're all a letter away from per-perpetual bliss
Put an F on the B of your bu-bu-bu-bu-bucket list

You know he got me thinking 'bout the way that I've been living
Seems like I'm always going, but I don't know where I'm getting
I's over-existenializing my redneck
But the answer is as simple as simple can get
I just re-arranged some letters in the alphabet

I made a bucket list, changed the B to an F
I gave my give-a-damn the finger, so it got up and left
I quit worrying 'bout people's expectations
And ordered up a six-pack of chillaxification

If you're a little depressed, feel a little bit lost
Maybe write it all down, and then blow it all off
We're all a letter away, from per-perpetual bliss
Put an F on the B of your bucket list

I took my nots and I added a why
I took the U out of hugh and I added an I
I, I bet you can guess what I did next
I took my bitching-lying lover and I added an ex

I made a bucket list, changed the B to an F
I gave my give-a-damn the finger, so it got up and left
I quit worrying 'bout people's expectations
And ordered up a six-pack of chillaxification

If you're a little depressed, feel a little bit lost
Maybe write it all down, and then blow it all off
We're all a letter away, from per-perpetual bliss
Put an F on the B of your bu-bu-bu-bu-bucket list
Bucket list
