Lyrics:


Mommy, I've got a question
Mommy, I wanna know
Where do babies come from?
Do they come from rainbows and love?
Mommy mommy, tell me please
Where do babies come from, really?

They come from boys, who like to sit on their ass
They come from girls who want, to grow up too fast
They come from screaming, fighting, make-up sex
They come from little girls like yourself
Little girls like yourself

Daddy, where do little babies come from?
Daddy tells that they come from the sky
Never explains, when I asked why
Do they come from angels in love?
Or do they come from demons and lust?
Daddy daddy! Tell me please
Where do babies come from, really?

They come from boys, who take, things they don't own
They come from girls, who begged, to be left alone
They come from pleading, screaming, no no no
There's an accident, from so long ago

What a lovely little mess I made
I throw milk at the wall in rage
I'm just tryna forget the pain
Mommy, daddy, tell me please
Where do babies come from, really...

They come from, boys, who like, to sit on their ass
They come from girls, who want, to grow up too fast
They come from, screaming, fighting, make-up sex
They come from little girls, like yourself

They come from boys, who take, things they don't own
They come from girls who begged, to be left alone
They come from pleading, screaming, no no no
There's an accident, from so long ago

They come from, boys, who like, to sit on their ass
They come from girls, who want, to grow up too fast
They come from, screaming, fighting, make-up sex
They come from little girls, like yourself

They come from boys...
They come from girls...
From screaming, fighting, make up sex
They come from little girls, like yourself
