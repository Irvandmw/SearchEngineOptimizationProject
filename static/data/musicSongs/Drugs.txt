Lyrics:


Aw yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Aw aw, oh yeah yeah
Aw aw

I got you on my mind, oh
I got you on my mind
You're not here and I can't sleep
I got you on my mind
And I can't seem to find you, nowhere
Baby, you got me patrollin'
'Cause you been on the run for discomfort
Girl, don't hide it
I'm just tryna to this dirty laundry
I got a few towels to throw in
Just lick my blunt when I roll it

'Cause I can't get enough of your drugs
'Cause I can't get enough of your drugs
So baby, just tell me when you're ready, oh
Ooh baby, just tell me when you're ready

Guess you can't give me no answers
If I can't give you no ransom
You're 'bout to take your chances
And do shit the hard way
When you left that door open
Girl, I got the notion
You still had emotions
Guess our lips is golden
Baby, when I tell you I want you, I want you bad
If not more than before, I want you more than the time before that
I can't give you no closure, no
I can't give you no closure, oh
I can't give you no way out
I can't give you no way out
I can't give you no way out, yeah
I can't give you no way out

'Cause I can't get enough of your drugs
'Cause I can't get enough of your drugs
So baby, just tell me when you're ready, oh
Ooh baby, just tell me when you're ready
