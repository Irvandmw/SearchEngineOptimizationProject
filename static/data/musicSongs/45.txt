Lyrics:


And I'm like Jordan wearing 45
I told you I was coming back
And every time they tried to push me out
I told you I was coming back
45, 45, going back like I ain't leave
45, 45, I been nice since 23
Balling hard, balling hard, swear I need a referee
I can see the jealousy, the haters always mad at me, I know

Now why you keep me going? Why you keep me going?
Knowing it can't stop a nigga
But I know they know, and they already know it
Yeah I know I'm on but I'll still off a nigga, woah
Before we even talking, what's your offer nigga? Woah
Make sure that bank account is looking proper, nigga
Make sure my niggas eating steak and lobster nigga
We hustle hard, you hardly hustle, that's your problem nigga
Question us and we can solve it, what's your problem nigga?
Funny how these busters turn to Prima Donna niggas
My whole team, my whole team, yeah we looking like the Bulls in 92 and 93, yeah
My whole team, my whole team, yeah you know it's OHB, 45

And I'm like Jordan wearing 45
I told you I was coming back
And every time they tried to push me out
I told you I was coming back
45, 45, going back like I ain't leave
45, 45, I been nice since 23
Balling hard, balling hard, swear I need a referee
I can see the jealousy, the haters always mad at me, I know

Now why you keep me going? Why you keep me going?
Knowing it can't stop a nigga
They quick to try and put my shit out in the open
Yeah it's cool, I ain't forgot it nigga
Now these famous bitches started blowing up my line again
Basic bitches calling cause they bank accounts is minusing, no
Money ain't a problem, we got commas boy, woah
If you don't want these problems, save the drama boy, woah
Fame for the real ones, shut the roster boy, woah
And my niggas still gon' eat that steak and lobster boy, woah
My whole team, my whole team, yeah we looking like the Bulls in 92 and 93, yeah
My whole team, my whole team, yeah we looking hard to beat

And I'm like Jordan wearing 45
I told you I was coming back
And every time they tried to push me out
I told you I was coming back
45, 45, going back like I ain't leave
45, 45, I been nice since 23
Balling hard, balling hard, swear I need a referee
I can see the jealousy, the haters always mad at me, I know

I'mma spend a 100 racks in K.O.D
You know they sucking dick if they in V.I.P
Told the waitress to roll up, bitch forget the drinks
All this money in the air, the pussy follow me
A .45 on my side, I'm 'bout to drive
Trap jumping out the jam, think I can fly
45, 23, bounce
Money I'm counting, wanna be like Mike

And I'm like Jordan wearing 45
I told you I was coming back
And every time they tried to push me out
I told you I was coming back
45, 45, going back like I ain't leave
45, 45, I been nice since 23
Balling hard, balling hard, swear I need a referee
I can see the jealousy, the haters always mad at me, I know
