Lyrics:


You broke my heart in a million pieces
I haven't been quite the same since then
Can't we pick up the pieces, put them together
And start all over again

You went away and my whole heart crumbled
All of my dreams were just torn apart
Can't we pick up the pieces, put them together
And try to make a brand new start

What good are my arms, if they don't hold you
Like they used to hold you tight
What good are my lips, if they don't kiss you
Day and night

You broke my heart in a million pieces
But it can be mended just like new
Won't you pick up the pieces, put them together
And love me like I love you
And love me like I love you
And love me like I love you
