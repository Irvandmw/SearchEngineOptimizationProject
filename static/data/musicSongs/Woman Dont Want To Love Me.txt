Lyrics:


Woman don't want to love me
She says it makes her cry
Woman don't want to love me
That's an alibi
Lovin' gets complicated
You have to want to try
Won't be simply stated
You gotta look for some perfection
You're gonna lose some affection
Cryin' bye
Woman don't want to love me
She says she wants to go
Woman don't want to love me
She's tired of feelin' low
'Cause lovin' gets complicated
Just start with what you know
Won't be simply stated
Fill yourself with emotion
To earn yourself some devotion
Woman don't want to love me
She hates to be alone
Woman don't want to love me
She hates the telephone
'Cause lovin' gets complicated
It's a little bit too fast
Won't be simply stated
We gotta fix this situation
With the final liberation
Of this man
