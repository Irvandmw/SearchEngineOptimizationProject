Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I'd climb the highest mountain
If I knew that when I climbed that mountain
I'd find you

I'd swim the deepest river
If I knew that when I swam that river
I'd find you

Without you dear my life means nothing to me
No matter where you are
That's where I want to be

I'd pray to get to Heaven
'Cause I know that if I got to Heaven
I'd find you

Without you dear my life means nothing to me
No matter where you are
That's where I want to be

I'd pay the price of sorrow
If I only knew that some tomorrow
I'd find you
