Lyrics:


You go, you come, you stay wit me
Come back again!
You're here, babe.

We donât wanna
We donât wanna
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna neva

[Chorus:]
We donât wanna neva end
Itâs like our life has just began
You walkinâ out, you cominâ back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl, hold it up for ransom
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna

I could tell you was into me, from my instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
Iâll go to war over you, I donât give a fuck about showing you
You know what it is, shorty, forever my little shawty
Long as Iâm swimminâ in benjamins, you shop with no limited
Youâll reminisce every session, love, know youâll come back again
I know you canât breathe without me, you gonâ need the oxygen
I damn near gave you an overdose on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ainât been right ever since
As I think to myself what it be is it heaven sent
Letâs put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us!

[Chorus:]
We donât wanna neva end
Itâs like our life has just began
You walkinâ out, you cominâ back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
I got all the questions, you got all the answers
I done took your heart, boy, held it up for ransom
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna

Oh, neva say neva
From the day we got together
I thought it'd be forever but, baby, oh,
You showed your true colors
I canât believe you played me
I let you meet my mother!
Oh, you hung out with my brother,
My significant other.
You know I still love you, baby
Oh, boy, you make me so mad,
But I just come right back
Itâs like I canât get over you,
I canât get over you.
And the things that you do
Swear I donât want nobody but you, baby!

[Chorus:]
We donât wanna neva end
Itâs like our life has just began
You can walkinâ out, you cominâ back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, hold it up for ransom
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna

Is there anything you wanna know? (do ask me)
Is there any place you'd rather be? (I know the answer)
You walk until your feet get sore (watch this)
I bet you walking back
I bet you walking back to me (matter fact)
Actually thatâs a guarantee (on everything)
Our friendship was guaranteed
You got my ego in another league
I ainât tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket

[Chorus:]
We donât wanna neva end
Itâs like our life has just began
You walkinâ out, you cominâ back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
I got all the questions, you got all the answers
I done took your heart, boy, held it up for ransom
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna
We donât wanna neva end
We donât wanna
