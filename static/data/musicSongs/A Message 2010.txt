Lyrics:


My song is love
My song is love, unknown
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

My heavy heart
Looks like it's made of stone
But it's so hard to see, clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
Oh I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm not singing on my own

That bitter breeze
That bitter breeze has blown
Left me on fire, for you, clearly
Taken everything and gone
Itâs taken everything I own

But I'm not gonna take it back
Iâm not gonna say I donât mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say
Oh I'm nothing on my own
Till that bitter breeze has blown

My song is love, is love unknown
And Iâve got to get that message home
