Lyrics:


Now she wants a butter & egg man
From way out in the West
She wants somebody who's workin' all day
So she's got money when she wants to play

Now pretty clothes, they'll never be mine
But what she told me the other day
I hope she don't change her mind

Now she wants a butter & egg man
A great big butter & egg man
From way down South
