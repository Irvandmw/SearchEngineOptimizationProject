Lyrics:


It's a shame that I'm never gonna see your face again, mmm
We're both strangers but I'm kind of hoping maybe that could change, yeah

Well, I hope I don't sound out of place
And maybe you will think it's crazy
You look amazing, so I say it straight

I've got a real fast car with the keys in
And I'm just five miles from a feeling
So when your red lights go turning green, now
If you say you're coming with me
I'll take you there

(There)
(I'll take you there)
(There)
We're just five miles from a feeling
(I'll take you there)

Such a waste that you are stuck here working in this place, mmm
So come on, take my hand 'cause there's nothing in this town to make you stay, yeah

Well, I hope I don't sound out of place
And maybe you will think it's crazy
I think it's time we make our getaway

I've got a real fast car with the keys in
And I'm just five miles from a feeling
So when your red lights go turning green, now
If you say you're coming with me
I'll take you there

(There)
(I'll take you there)
(There)
We're just five miles from a feeling
(I'll take you there)
(There)
(I'll take you there)
(There)
We're just five miles from a feeling

I've got a hundred dollars
And you're mine for the colors
I could just go and you could stay
I've met a million others
Lived a thousand summers
Something 'bout you makes me wanna say

I've got a real fast car with the keys in
And I'm just five miles from a feeling
So when your red lights go turning green, now
If you say you're coming with me
I'll take you there

(There)
(I'll take you there)
(There)
We're just five miles from a feeling
(I'll take you there)
(There)
(I'll take you there)
(There)
We're just five miles from a feeling
