Lyrics:


[Chorus:]
You know you want me back
You up here bout to have a heart attack
You know, you know, you know, you want it bad
That's why you bout to have a heart attack
Ooo ooo ooo...
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo ooo ooo...

I saw her walkin, I said who's that lady by the door
Feel like I know her, I swear I seen that walk before
So I got closer, to see what's going down
She was with someone else, I was kinda freaking out

I see you looking and wishing
Don't act like you don't want it again

[Chorus:]
You know you want me back
You up here bout to have a heart attack
You know, you know, you know, you want it bad
That's why you bout to have a heart attack
Ooo ooo ooo...
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo ooo ooo...

I said "How are you? How you doing? How you been?"
She says "I'm lovely, did I introduce my friend?"
I started treat her, don't even know what for
Seeing her with someone else is only made me want it more

I see you looking and wishing
Don't act like you don't want it again

[Chorus x2:]
You know you want me back
You up here bout to have a heart attack
You know, you know, you know, you want it bad
That's why you bout to have a heart attack
Ooo ooo ooo...

I I want it, I need it
I want it, I need it
I I want it, I need it
I want it, I want it...

[Chorus x2:]
You know you want me back
You up here bout to have a heart attack
You know, you know, you know, you want it bad
That's why you bout to have a heart attack
Ooo ooo ooo...

Ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo ooo ooo...
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo ooo...
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo ooo ooo...
Ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo ooo...

[Chorus:]
You know you want me back
You up here bout to have a heart attack
You know you know you know you want it bad
That's why you bout to have a heart attack
Ooo ooo ooo...
