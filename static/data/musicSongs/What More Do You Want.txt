Lyrics:


Tell me what's wrong
Tell me what's right
Tell me how you want me to do it tonight
I don't want to sing 
I don't want to shout
I just want a feeling that I'm living without

What more do you want
What more do you want
What more do you want
From me

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me that you only want to get it from me
I know what to say 
I know what to do
I know that you're staying
So the jokes on you

What more do you want
What more do you want
What more do you want
From me
(That's what you want, that's right)

Tell me what's wrong
Tell me what's right
Tell me how you want me to do it tonight
I don't want to sing 
I don't want to shout
I just want a feeling that I'm living without

I know what to say
I know what to do
I know that you're staying so the jokes on you
I don't want to wait but tell me it's right
I don't want to wait, cause I've been waiting all night

What more do you want (do you want)
What more do you want (do you want)
What more do you want (do you want)
What more do you want (do you want)
From me
