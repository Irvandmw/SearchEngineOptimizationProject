Lyrics:


When will we die?
This life isn't fair
I miss the high
I live a lie
And one day we'll die
No one will care
Take me inside
And I'll meet you there

Am I alive?
Am I aware?
Do you get high?
Are we prepared?
And one day we'll die
No one will care
Do you get high?
We will survive

Who do you think you are?
Young man, young man

Yeah, man I think you went too far
You can't stop the dance
Don't ever let em stop the dance (yeah)
Are we alone?
Where are we going?
What have we become?
It all keeps on rollin'
A little bit of life lets the hope grow
A lot goes on that they don't know
Just give me a sign to show me something
Is it my time? Can I stop running?
Lost in the night and it's so cold
Don't forget the things that we don't know
I made my peace, can I go home?

Am I alive?
Am I aware?
Do you get high?
Are we prepared?
And one day we'll die
No one will care
Do you get high?
We will survive

To the girl named Danger
It's so good to see you
Don't be a stranger
It's clear I need you
The angels will fall
Not a saint after all
Back to the wall
Let me free you
Save me from evil
Give me a reason
Where are the good people?
Give us our freedom
Where are the dreamers?
Can you show me the dreamers?
We are the creatures, prophets and teachers
We are the believers, lost in amnesia
Will you let me fade away?
I want to fade away

Am I alive?
Am I aware?
Do you get high?
Are we prepared?
And one day we'll die
No one will care
Do you get high?
We will survive
