Lyrics:


(Oh, oh, oh)
(Yeah)

Started off a team
Ballin' till we get the ring
We wanna compete
But it's the weekend
We should link and party
Till I need some ice on my knees
Chillin' with my niece, cousins, aunties
Come on everybody
What you bringin' to the pot luck? I'm excited
Everybody got a spot, love, you're invited
Hate is just lost love
So they hidin'
Never know try it
You just might like it

First, it was all love
Hands up super star love
That you can have it, you can have it all, love
But then you took it, took it all, love
All love
Turn it up louder
Sing along, get the crowd up
But then you took it all, love
Then forgot all about us but it's all love
(Oh, but it's all love)

Congratulations
You finally turned from the wrong station
Thank you for y'alls patience
I'll try not to make this a long statement
Momma said I shouldn't swear
So I'ma just put this on Dayton's

Nobody's born hatin'
Nobody's born fake
Why we fightin' over
Something we can all make?
That's stingy love
I'm just givin' love, ain't no givin' up
If you alive, only thing to do is live it up

I know you like that (Like that)
I know you really, really like that (Like that)
I know you not gonna do me like that
Give it to you bring it right back

First, it was all love
Hands up super star love (Stars up)
That you can have it you can have it all, love
(And you can get it how you want)
But then you took it took it all, love
All love
Turn it up louder (Turn it up louder)
Sing along get the crowd up (Get the crowd up, come on)
But then you took it all love
Then forgot all about us
But it's all love

I feel you
Sounds good in my ear
When I hear it like that
I feel you
I say I look good to the mirror
And it says it right back
I feel you
A little love wouldn't kill you (A little love wouldn't kill you)
You really did me wrong it was real cruel (It was cruel)
(Yeah) Had a lot of love and I still do 'cause I feel you

What you bringing to the potluck? You're invited
Lemme get a lil' rice, put it on the side
With a lil' love on it (I need some love)
What you put a rub on it? I can't get enough
I ain't never had nothin' like this

What you bringing to the potluck? You're invited
Lemme get a lil' rice, put it on the side
With a lil' love on it, What you put a rub on it?
I can't get enough
I can't get enough (Uh)

First, it was all love (First, it was love)
Hands up super star love (Hands up superstar love)
That you can have it, you can have it all, love
(You can get it how you want)
But then you took it took it all, love
All love
Turn it up louder (Turn the music up)
Sing along get the crowd up (Oh, get the crowd up)
But then you took it all, love (Took it all, love, come on)
Then forgot all about us but it's all love

I feel you
Sounds good in my ear
When I hear it like that
I feel you
I say I look good to the mirror
And it says it right back (Oh)
I feel you
A little love wouldn't kill you (A little love wouldn't kill you)
You really did me wrong it was real cruel (It was real cruel)
Had a lot of love and I still do 'cause I feel you

I feel you (I feel you)
Sounds good in my ear
When I hear it like that
(Sounds so good)
I feel you
I say I look good to the mirror
And it says it right back (Oh)
I feel you
A little love wouldn't kill you (A little love wouldn't kill you)
You really did me wrong it was real cruel
Had a lot of love and I still do 'cause I feel you
