Lyrics:


So we laid down on the floor next to our brand new bed
Just so we could listen closer to this new Kanye West
But I can barely hear over the music in my head
All these 808s and heartbeats bangin' in your chest

Told the driver "keep it goin'," he can run the meter
So we could finally hear Views on some decent speakers
Yellin' every time the beat drop like a cheerleader
Spillin' a flask of Avion on your brand new sneakers

Now we at the Vogue party and the whole thing's catered
So we said that we'd leave early, get some pizza later
But my hands go down your jeans and you distract the waiter
Until we take it somewhere better like the elevator

'Til we back out on the 405 with Baby Bash
You're making me laugh, and I'm just trying not to crash
But all we do is drive, sugar howâd you get so fly?
And I see people staring at us from the overpass
But these days I've dropped the keys to Anthony's Mercedes
We're standin' naked in the kitchen listenin' to Amy
And in those weeks you fuckin' lost it cause you just wrote "Crazy"
And it seems like you never listen and I hate you lately...
