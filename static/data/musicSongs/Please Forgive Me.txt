Lyrics:


You didnât wanna wake up
âcause in your dreams the sky was blue

You couldnât make the rain stop
and it was hard to hold the truth

[Chorus:]
A heavy shadow in the light
Daddyâs slipping out of sight
Leaving more than just an empty bed
Leaving more than just confusion in your head

Now you can make the rain stop
âcause now youâre old enough to know
where I went wrong

[Chorus:]
A heavy shadow in the light
Daddyâs slipping out of sight
Leaving more than just a broken heart
Leaving more than just one question for the stars

A heavy shadow in the light
Daddyâs slipping out of sight
Leaving more than just a broken heart
Leaving more than just one question for the stars

[Release:]
I had to fly away to another place
I was sad but I had to get a smile back on my face
So can you please forgive me now

Things are getting better and we are no longer blind
Everything looks different
So can we leave it all behind
