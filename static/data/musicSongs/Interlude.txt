[Lil Dicky:]
Brain, you're so cute
[Brain:]
Aight
[Lil Dicky:]
I just..I felt really in the moment there, the way the light is just glistening off of your creases
[Brain:]
I...I'm tryna focus, bro
[Lil Dicky:]
Okay, okay. Can I do one song like without you on this project?
[Brain:]
Without me?
[Lil Dicky:]
No, it'll still be your song, but you'll be more like a DJ Khaled of it. Like..the organizer, the facilitator as oppo- like you pick the rappers but I just wanna go really hard like really bad without you be-
[Brain:]
What makes you think I'd even pick you, bro?
[Lil Dicky:]
Well, c'mon, Brain. We both know that you would pick me
[Brain:]
Well this shit better be hard, bro
