Lyrics:


Baby please, you donât have to explain the reasons 
This is me, I know your mind can change like the seasons 
Go your way, I know the world is calling your name boy 
Itâs okay, cuz what we got it ainât gonna change boy 

As long as weâve been together 
Youâve always been the one 
Nobody knows you better 
When all is said and done 

When your friends start to trip 
And youâre loosin your grip 
And you cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And youâre lost in the dark 
And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone thatâll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to? 
Who ya gonna run to? 

You and me we go back to jump rope and grade school 
Memories when you were tryinâ so hard to play cool 
I donât mind I know that you gotta go through your changes 
Take your time sometimes are hard to rearrange it 

As long as weâve been together 
Youâve always been the one 
Nobody knows you better 
When all is said and done 

When your friends start to trip 
And youâre loosin your grip 
And you cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And youâre lost in the dark 
And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone thatâll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to? 
Who ya gonna run to? 

There ainât nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do) 
So when you realise you need the one you said goodbye to (bye to) 
Look over your shoulder boy and you know who be there 

You know Iâm gonna be right there (right there) 

When your friends start to trip 
And your loosin your grip 
And u cant find your way back home 
When your world falls apart 
And youâre lost in the dark 
And you know that your all alone 
When you just can deal, and you need something real 
Someone thatâll always come through 
Who ya gonna run to? 
Who ya gonna run to? 

When thereâs nobody else in the world you can put your trust in 
(Who ya gonna run to) 
And you find all the haters around you, they donât mean nothing 
(Who ya gonna run to) 
Who ya gonna run to?
