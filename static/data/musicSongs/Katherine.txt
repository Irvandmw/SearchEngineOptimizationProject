Lyrics:


Katherine
I heard his mother
Talking about you
Saying how cute you are
Oh, but for her son, girl, you'll never do

And here's one more thing I've got to let you know
If he decided to ever let you go

Girl, just call me when things get rough
They say you'll never be good enough
I hope you'll never be good enough for him
But you're good enough for me
Katherine

They say wedding plans
Have already been made
I can hear his mother say
"Oh I'd love to put off until a later day"

And if he don't seem interested at all
Dial my number I'll be waiting on your call

Girl, you'll never be good enough
They say you'll never be good enough
I pray you'll never be good enough for him
But you're good enough for me

Oh, Katherine

They may never understand I love you
Place nobody else right here above you
Ooh

Katherine
I heard his mother talking about you
