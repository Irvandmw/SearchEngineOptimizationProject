Lyrics:


There's a famous man who's the idol of every clown
He started the profession and his tricks he handed down
So everyone who has a yen to be a happy man
Calls on Punchinello to help him if he can

Punchinello, hey Punchinello
La la la la la la you wonderful fellow
The fun you brought us [JL] The things you taught us
[Both] Make a sad and weary world wonderfully mellow
[Both] Now when we're having trouble, the half a mountain high
[Both] A circus clown can knock 'em down and never bat an eye
[Both] Punchinello, hey Punchinello
[DM] Oh the face of every clown's a work of art
[Both] Punchinello molto bello you ring a bell a bell a bell here in my heart

[JL] Punchinello, hey Punchinello
[JL] All my life I yearned to be your kind of fellow
[JL] If I could only make a lonely
[JL] Turn a gals little laugh into a bellow

[DM] To carry off the children to some enchanted lands
[DM] To see their eyes and bright surprise is all that he demands
[JL] Hey Punchinello [DM] Hey Punchinello
[JL] Let me change my face and tumble up and down
[DM] Hey Punchinello molto bello
[JL] Do you suppose I have a chance at being a clown

[High voice] Many hear the call in the city of Napoli
[Deep voice] The babe with Punchinello was the man they came to see
[Man] The clown would captivate the peasants or the noble prince
[DM] And in every circus they've done it ever since

[Both] Punchinello, hey Punchinello
[All] La la la la la you wonderful fellow
[All] The fun you brought us the things you taught us
[All] Make a sad a weary world wonderfully mellow

[DM] The clown in the circus will get a special pride
[DM] When people laugh the kind of laugh that warms them up inside
[All] Punchinello, hey Punchinello
[All] Oh the face of every clown's a work of art
[DM & JL] Punchinello molto bello
[DM & JL] You ring a bell a bell a bell a bell a bell a bell a bell a bell a bell a bell a bell a bell here in my heart
[All] Hey, Punchinello

[DM & JL] Punchinello, hey Punchinello oh the face of every clown's a work of art
[DM & JL] Punchinello molto bello
You ring a bell a bell a bell a bell a bell
A bell a bell a bell a bell a bell
Here in my heart
