Lyrics:


I know something you don't
That's me coming for you
You want war
We got war
We just wanna warn you

I know something you don't
That's me coming for you
You want war
We got war
We just wanna warn you

War for war
Bodies that hit the ground
You ready for us
'Cause it's bout to go down
Push 'em to the left
Push 'em to the right
Load the choppers up
Hit 'em on sight
Never turning back
I've done been to hell and back
Me, running out of guns?
No, never heard of that
I ain't never ran from a gunfight
This is you and me
Mano y Mano
You damn right

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide, you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

Respiratory beggin' for relief
I don't let 'em breathe
Goin' hard, I'm my own boss
Many ain't believe it
A feeling not an item
Appearing up out of thin air
Conquer everything that's in front of me
Now they under me
Rush to lead and respond
They strayed away, how a tunnel be
Took a leap of faith
Bungee cord about to give out
Nowadays whatever you say you gotta live out
Altitude have a parachute failure, we got a problem
Grow a set of wings or die when you hit the bottom
Never prayed to God, but never too late to try Him
Shots fired, Allen Iverson in the league
They say I ball hog and I'm not a part of the team
Breadwinner with these winners, built the regime
Taliban weapon in hand, kill everything
Amphetamines all for the state of a better means
I'm beautiful but known for the dope like Medellin

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide, you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide, you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

Dress in all black like a funeral
Murder, homicide wanna ride get residuals
Layin' on fire for residuals
365 when I grind for residuals
45 Magnum in the van wit him
Ratta tatta tat I let the blam hit them
I scream fuck the whole world and put a bomb in it
Finger on the trigger, tryna put my whole arm in it
I just want revenge, I just want revenge
We get it poppin' everyday
They took away my happiness
They try to take my head away

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide, you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide, you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
