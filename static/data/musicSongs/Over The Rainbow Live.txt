Lyrics:


Somewhere over the rainbow 
Way up high 
There's a land that I heard of 
Once in a lullaby 

Some day I'll wish upon a star 
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me 
Where troubles melt like lemondrops 
Away above the chimney tops 
That's where you'll find me 

Somewhere over the rainbow 
Bluebirds fly 
Birds fly over the rainbow 
Why then, oh why can't I?
