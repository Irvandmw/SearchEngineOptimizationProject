Lyrics:


Red, Red Desert, heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
What a blessing to feel your love
Twilight moments with you

I've been asleep so long
I'm so far away
Visions I see are strong
I hear what they say

Won't you leave all your fears at the edge of the world
I'll tell you again like I told you before
I've been asleep so long
Wasting away

Tell me would you pack up all your bags, stay true to north?
You're the only one I'd do this for

Red, Red Desert, heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
What a blessing to feel your love
Twilight moments with you

It doesn't take too long
To heal and replace
The demons we're running from
They are begging to stay

Tell me would you pack up all your bags, stay true to north?
You're the only one I'd do this for

Red, Red Desert, heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
What a blessing to feel your love
Twilight moments with you

Red
Red
Red, Red
Red, Red

Red, Red Desert, heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
(Diving deeper for you, diving deeper for you)
What a blessing to feel your love
Twilight moments with you
(All these moments with you, all these moments with you)

Would you pack up all your bags, stay true to north?
You're the only one I'd do this for

Red, Red Desert, heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
