Baby Jesus
(It's the baby)
Feeling like a god when I walk in the building
I don't give a fuck 'bout who feel me (Feel me)
I really don't care who ahead of me
Y'all just trying to be local celebrities
Switching lanes with the thing, keep it next to me
Shit I rob, I'ma serve 'em
My foot on the gas and I'm swervin'
I be pulling out fast like a virgin
Oh
Baby Jesus
Baby Jesus
Man, these bitch niggas was dabbing in the club last night
Yeah, yeah
Bitch ass niggas spilled their drink all over my arm, man
Look

Feeling like a god when I walk in the building
I don't give a fuck 'bout who feel me (Feel me)
I really don't care who ahead of me
Y'all just trying to be local celebrities
Switching lanes with the thing, keep it next to me
Shit I rob, I'ma serve 'em
My foot on the gas and I'm swervin'
I be pulling out fast like a virgin

Y'all niggas boring, I can't relate
Cast out on the forum with paper plates
Walked out with the title like Golden State
It feel like I just won the finals
And I put that shit on the bible
Please excuse my language, but I cannot tame it
And I knew how to cuss back when I was a baby
My mama was workin', my uncles didn't raise me
I know that it's crazy
Yeah, that's my freak bitch, you call her your baby
I'm in the sheets laying down with your baby
She rub on my chest and tell me I'm her favorite, ay
To all of the niggas who play with me
Don't ever think I'ma forget about it
I keep a pistol on stage with me
You clutchin', we gon' hit up anybody
You sayin' that one of these rappers try me
I'ma send a shoot and let it catch anybody
Hit the funeral like nothing happened
Just to double-back to come and fuck yo' thotty
The [?] keep telling me "Lil' bro, chill, you was made for this shit, you wait for mail"
My cousin denied on his first appeal
Lot of niggas snitchin' acting like they real
Just kicked a ho out my spot
I made that bitch walk it out
What did I tell you about running yo' mouth?
I had to go put that bitch in time-out
I do not think I was meant for a spouse
I don't have the time, blame it on my ambition
These niggas [?], they want all yo' attention
Soon as you go broke, then that ho gon' go missing
All of the bitches who counted me out
I take my dick, put it all in they mouth
Fuck all the rumors, I don't even listen
Off the computer, y'all niggas is bitches
How you a shooter? You don't got a pistol
Whole lotta goons, but they only on Twitter
You wanna try if you want some attention
I point out a victim, my nigga gon' get him
But I'd rather get money, be positive
No, you ain't getting money, it's obvious
Any beat, I'ma eat, I'ma body it
Entertainment for the guys and the goddesses

Nigga
Baby Jesus
You already know it
You already know it
