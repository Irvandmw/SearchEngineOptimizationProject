Lyrics:


What would you do without me what would you do boy
What would you do without me when I'm gone
[JL] I'd sell my car and hock my ring and go right out and hire B-Bing
[JL] That's what I'd do without you that's what I'd do

[JL] But tell me what would you do without me what would you do boy
[JL] What would you do without me when I'm gone
I've have no trouble replacing you
I'd just go down to the nearest zoo
Oh that's what I'd do without you that's what I'd do
[JL] We will be [Both] Just like brothers you and I
[JL] I'm for you [DM] I'm for me
[Both] And I love you 'til I die

Oh what would you do without me what would you do boy
What would you do without me when I'm gone
[JL] When my bank roll's gone and need some dough
[JL] You're always telling me where to go
See what you would do without me what would you do

We will be just like brothers you and I
I'll go east [JL] I'll go west
[Both] And I'll love you 'til we die
Oh what would you do without me what would you do boy
What would you do without me when I'm gone
[JL] I've been your stooge and been your clown
Who picks you up when you are down
[JL] Who had ten bucks and gave you nine
Who sticks by you come rain or shine
[JL] Always taking it on the chin
Who's always there who's a win
[JL] Who's always there a regular guy
[Both] I'll love you 'til I die
[Both] Oh what would you do without me what would you do
