Lyrics:


[Unknown Man:] This should be played at high volume

[Bella:] Leggo!

[Bella:]
You talk a good game but I know
You don't really think that I'm a fall for that
No, I won't
Say what you gon' do, you better show
Keep it one hunned or see your way to the door

See boy I don't really think you get what I'm sayin'
This ain't recess so I ain't playin'
With the wrong move that you're makin'
You say you will but I know that you're fakin'

[Pia Mia:]
I hear you talkin'
But you're really not sayin' nothin'
[Bella:] Calm that down
[Pia Mia:]
I don't care about what you got
You're frontin' cause you know you're just a

[Both:]
Bubble-b-b-bubble you's a Bubblegum Boy
You's a Bubblegum Boy, you's a Bubblegum Boy
You's a Bubblegum Boy, you's a Bubblegum Boy
All you do is pop a lot, a-a-all you do is pop a lot

Bubble-b-b-bubble you's a Bubblegum Boy
You's a Bubblegum Boy, you's a Bubblegum Boy
You's a Bubblegum Boy, you's a Bubblegum Boy
Ya better be ready to back it up, back it up

[Pia Mia:]
You're talkin' like you're young
You need to grow up
Guys are one and the same
You get no love, not lookin' for the typical, oh no!
You're not even worth the visuals (n-n-no-no)

I don't think you get what I'm sayin'
This ain't recess and I ain't playin'
With the wrong moves you're makin'
You say you will but I know you're fakin'!

I hear you talkin'
But you're really not sayin' nothin'
[Bella:] Calm that down
[Pia Mia:]
I don't care about what you got
You're frontin' cause you know you're just a

[Both:]
Bubble-b-b-bubble you's a Bubblegum Boy
You's a Bubblegum Boy, you's a Bubblegum Boy
You's a Bubblegum Boy, you's a Bubblegum Boy
All you do is pop a lot, a-a-all you do is pop a lot

Bubble-b-b-bubble you's a Bubblegum Boy
You's a Bubblegum Boy, you's a Bubblegum Boy
You's a Bubblegum Boy, you's a Bubblegum Boy
You better be ready to back it up, back it up
