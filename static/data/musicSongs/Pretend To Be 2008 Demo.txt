Lyrics:


You say that you're proud of me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And take somethin' out of me
So, oh, oh
Predictable

Why do I have to see this through?
Why do I have to take this?
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this?

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be

You're stuck with apologies
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And take another shot at me
So, oh, oh
Predictable

Why do I have to see this through?
Why do I have to take this?
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this?

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend this

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be

Oh, oh

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend this

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be
