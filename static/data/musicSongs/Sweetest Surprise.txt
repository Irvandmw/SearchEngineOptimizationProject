Lyrics:


I never knew life could be like this
Never thought I would be the one that you would kiss
I never knew love could be so rough
but now I've found the real thing I can't get enough

[Chorus:]
The sweetest surprise
caught me tonight
right there in your eyes while I was kissing you
so don't say that you don't love
everything you dream of could be here

I used to wish, I used to dream
but now I'm living my hearts wildest fantasy
so I began to believe
because our love is there for everyone to see

[Chorus:]
The sweetest surprise
caught me tonight
right there in your eyes while I was kissing you
so don't say that you don't love
everything you dream of could be here

on and on where good things never end
on and on where we never pretend
