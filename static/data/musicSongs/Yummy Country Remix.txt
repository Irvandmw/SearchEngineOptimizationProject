Yummy
Yo, J-B
Talk to 'em one time

[Justin Bieber:]
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
In the mornin' or the late
Say the word, on my way

Bona fide stallion
Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
Ain't on the side, you're number one
Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done

Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That horseback, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah

[Justin Bieber {Florida Georgia Line}:]
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe (Yeah, baby)
In the mornin' or the late {Hah, these the boys}
Say the word, on my way (Florida Georgia Line)

[Florida Georgia Line:]
Shoutout, girl, I'm on the way
I been up in Waffle House but you my Chik-fil-A
And I been into waffle fries since our first date (Haha)
Ain't got time for playin', I'ma clean your whole plate (Girl, I'ma lick it up)
Woo, yes, yummy, let me take ya to the country
We can call it home cookin', I'm your chicken, you my dumpling
We say grace, I say thanks, for my baby and this drink
Let me slide on over, girl, and get a taste (Let's roll)

[Justin Bieber, {Justin Bieber & Florida Georgia Line}:]
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy (You stay flexin' on me)
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum (Yeah, yeah)
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Say the word, on my way
{Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe (Yeah, babe)}
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
{Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe (Yeah, babe)}
In the mornin' or the late
Say the word, on my way

[Justin Bieber & Florida Georgia Line:]
