Lyrics:


Hey blue baby, put the Hank Williams on
It's your little blue baby, calling for her favorite song
Get a bad Whiskey, pour it right quickly
Put them hallway lights on
I hope one day you can remember
Our love before it all went wrong

When the only stars we saw were in the sky at the boulevard
And the only thing we wanted, was to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for
Played downtown at the local bar
That was me, she was me

Hey blue baby, get that old pick-up gone
Turn it once, twice, three times if you love me long
Get on that dirt bike, get on that turnpike
Do what you have to do
Just know your baby's back here waiting
Just know she thinks you're really cool

And the only stars we saw were in the sky at the boulevard
And the only thing we need, is to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for
Plays downtown at the local bar
That was me, she was me

I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of waiting, tired of crying
I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of yelling, tired of hollering
You're making me blue, you're making me blue, blue
You're making blue, just do what you do

And the only stars we need were in the sky at the boulevard
And the only thing we want, is to be free
And the only girl that you love still
Plays downtown at the local bar
Yeah she's me
Yeah she's me
