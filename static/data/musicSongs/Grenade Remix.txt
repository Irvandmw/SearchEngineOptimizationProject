Lyrics:


[Lil Wayne]
And I donât mind when we fall out
As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it
Heaven, have you ever been to it
Cause you look like you never been
Youâre more like a Hellâs angel
And for you, Iâd rather sin
Broken heart, Love you with a broken heart
For you Iâll jump off Noahâs Ark
Love is blind and hope is dark
But why does pain feel so good
Love is science, live for you
Die for you, and Iâll die smiling

[Bruno Mars]
Easy come, easy go
Thatâs just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all,
But you never give
Should of known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked,
Cause what you donât understand is

[Hook]
Iâd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Iâd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know Iâd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby;
But you wonât do the same

No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue beat me till Iâm numb
Tell the devil I said âheyâ when you get back to where youâre from
Mad woman, bad woman,
Thatâs just what you are, yeah,
Youâll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash

You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you donât understand is

[Hook]
Iâd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Iâd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah , yeah)
You know Iâd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby;
But you wonât do the same

If my body was on fire, ooh
Youâd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me youâre a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did babyâ¦

But darling Iâll still catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Iâd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know Iâd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby;
But you wonât do the same.
No, you wonât do the same,
You wouldnât do the same,
Ooh, youâll never do the same,
No, no, no, no
