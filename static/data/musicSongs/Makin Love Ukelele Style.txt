Lyrics:


(Making love ukelele style)
(Making love ukelele style)
Making love ukelele style you needn't be in Waikiki
Making love ukelele style to a lovely ukelele serenade

When you love ukelele style
Well everyone knows you're heart will float far away
To a tropic isle while a ukelele tune is softly played

Strolling along beneath the starlight
Dreaming a lover's dream for two
Soon you will see her eyes of starlight
As the ukelele magic comes through

Now if you want to satisfy
The one that you love all else above
Take a tip and be sure you try the ukelele style of making love

Strolling along beneath the starlight
Dreaming a lover's dream for two
Soon you will see her eyes of starlight
As the ukelele magic comes through

Now if you want to satisfy
The one that you love all else above
Take a tip and be sure you try the ukelele style of making love
Try the ukelele style of making love
Try the ukelele style of making love
