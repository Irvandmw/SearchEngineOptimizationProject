Song Name: Renovate My Life
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I need a window a bigger view
to keep my vision young and new
To handle teardrops upon my roof
make me waterproof

Install a heater to warm my soul
Supply some magic life patrol
Built me a castle where I can dwell
in my own shell

[Chorus:]
Renovate my life
Make it all right
Show me that the trees
can grow into the skies
Renovate renovate my life

The isolation between the walls
Makes it harder to hear your calls
I need a ground floor with open doors
Like I had before

[Chorus:]
Renovate my life
Make it all right
Show me that the trees
can grow into the skies
Renovate renovate my life
Turn around my life
Make it all right
Show me that there is
no limits in the skies
Turn around turn around my life

[Post Chorus:]
I wanna hear empty talking
as meaningful poetry
I wanna see aimless walking
as another way to be free
Living upon a surface
making you wanna feel
Some inner space
