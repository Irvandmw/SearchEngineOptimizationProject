Lyrics:


In my favorite pair of salt water sun bleached jeans
I gotta cold one coming and some songs to sing
My guitar's got brand new strings
It's a big old beautiful world
It's the blue sky days you don't wanna miss
Juke box dances and girls to kiss
Keeps us all living for nights like this
It's a big old beautiful world

It's a big old beautiful world out there
Sometimes you just gotta let it take you where
The roller coaster ride meets the tilt a whirl
It's a big old beautiful world
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
It's a big old beautiful world

There's a star in the sky for every grain of sand
And I stared up at night trying to understand
How it all fits in the palm of God's hand
It's a big old beautiful world

It's a big old beautiful world out there
Sometimes you just gotta let it take you where
The roller coaster ride meets the tilt a whirl
It's a big old beautiful world
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
It's a big old beautiful world
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
It's a big old beautiful world

To see a full moon rise and a sunset fall
Being out here in the middle of it all
Sometimes if feels good to feel so small
In this big old beautiful world

It's a big old beautiful world out there
Sometimes you just gotta let it take you where
The roller coaster ride meets the tilt a whirl
It's a big old beautiful world
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
It's a big old beautiful world
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
It's a big old beautiful world
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
It's a big old beautiful world
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
It's a big old beautiful world
