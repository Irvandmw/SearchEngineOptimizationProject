[Mike Shinoda:]
Forfeit the game
Stop the talk show
Product of what
You're taught to know
Forfeit the game
'Cause tomorrow
When it's all done,
you reap what you sow

[Chester Bennington:]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life
My pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say I'll do
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life
My pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

[Mike Shinoda:]
Forfeit the game
Stop the talk show
Product of what
You're taught to know
Forfeit the game
'Cause tomorrow
When it's all done,
you reap what you sow

Forfeit the game
Stop the talk show
Product of what
You're taught to know
Forfeit the game
'Cause tomorrow
When it's all done,
you reap what you sow

[Chester Bennington:]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

[Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
You like to think you're never wrong
(Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
(Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
(Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you've been through
You live what you've learned
