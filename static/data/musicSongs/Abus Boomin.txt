[MAN:] Metro Boomin in this motherfucker *laughs*. My niggas love you, but anyway, look. Got it all, got it all, look man, I got my one, my last nigga in the city with the clean. I ainât talking about that bottom of the bottle syringe shit with that plastic hair dryer reseal, or that blue top, we ainât none of that bullshit. So look, the one rule is, when we go in donât say nothing to Abu. He old school, you feel me?

[A bell rings as the two enter the store, loud music is playing]

[MAN:] Cut.. Abu can you cut that shit down man! Please!

[ABU:] Ohhh Free Band, Free Band, welcome back to my store. Loyal customer. You see my store still booming in the drought

[MAN:] Uh, he looking for some clean

[ABU:] Clean? What the fuck are you drinking, I thought we were drinking dirty?

[MAN:] Naw, hell naw man, I got $80-200 for you, right now. We just need a pint

[MAN #2:] Well just go get it out the back, Abu, Iâm out here waiting. Let me get some cigarillos and grab a couple of Sprites

[ABU:] Just for you only I give special price

[MAN:] Keep that number right where I need it, baby and we gon...

[MAN #2:] Yeah baby Iâm tryna fuck with that 86 hunnid

[ABU:] Who the fuck is the friend?

[ABU:] What in the fuck are you talking my number? Hmm?

[MAN:] Man cmon Abu, you open 24/7 now man

[ABU:] We say 7/24, not 24/7. Abu boomin motherfucker!
