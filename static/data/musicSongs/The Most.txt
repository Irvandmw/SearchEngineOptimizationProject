(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

This winter was as cold as you and I
I know you're home hoping I'm alright
How many times have I left you in the deep?
I don't know why you still believe in me

Oh and even at my darkest days
Even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay
Even when I run away
You love me the most

So why do I hurt you so?
Is it 'cause I know?
Why do I hurt you so?
Is it 'cause you love me the most?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) The most
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is it 'cause I know?
Is it 'cause you love me the most?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) The most
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is it 'cause I know? Yeah

Your tender touch is the feeling that I seek
I come to you when my judgement becomes weak
All that you are is all I ever need
I don't know why you still believe in me

Oh and even at my darkest days
Even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay
Even when I run away
You love me the most

So why do I hurt you so?
Is it 'cause I know?
Why do I hurt you so?
Is it 'cause you love me the most?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) The most
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is it 'cause I know?
Is it 'cause you love me the most?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) The most
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is it 'cause I know? Yeah

How many times have I left you in the deep?
I don't know why you still believe in me
