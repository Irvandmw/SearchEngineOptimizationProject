Lyrics:


Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (yeah-yeah)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

I hear those jingle bells
On this midnight clear
Hark the herald angels sing
Soon Santa will be here
All I want for Christmas
Is a silent night with you
And a frosty morning snow so we can go
On a sleigh ride just for two

Have a very Merry Christmas Day
And a Happy New Year too
Thank you for the love you give
My greatest gift is you

You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do
Merry Christmas, I love you

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

[?]

Have a very Merry Christmas Day
And a Happy New Year too
Thank you for the love you give
My greatest gift is you

You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do
Merry Christmas, I love you

When I count my blessings
You're the first one on my list
And when I feel a little lonely
You're the only one I miss

You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
I love you

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas, baby)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (yeah, yeah)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (dont't wanna live without you)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (baby)
