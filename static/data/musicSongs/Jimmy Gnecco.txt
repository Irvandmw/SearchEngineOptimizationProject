Lyrics:


I said Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
I like the way your name echo
You are so fine
I said Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Do you wanna help me let go of my dark mind?

If you want it it's yours
Its free, but of course
You're my sunshine
I said J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine

I said Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You are on another level
You are so fine
I said Hey, Jimmy, let's go
I've been in love since I met you, you are all mine

If you want it its yours
Its free, but of course
Pick a highlight
I said J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me a hot dog
Kiss me in the dark

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy
Kiss me in the dark

I said Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Hey, I like your heavy metal
Do you like mine?
I said Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You were smashin' from the get-go
This is your time

If you want it its yours
Its free, but of course
Pick a highlight
I said J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy
Kiss me in the dark

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me something pretty
Kiss me in the dark

Jimmy Gnecco
Jimmy Gnecco
Jimmy Gnecco, you are so fine
