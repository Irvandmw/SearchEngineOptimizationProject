Lyrics:


Girl, I'm goin' crazy, I'm lonely and I need your kiss
My body wants to call you but my ego says I got to resist
Come and stop it if you want to, but I ain't playin' second to none
You got to put your arms around me and tell me I'm the only one

No call you, you call me (Ooh wee)
If love is true, I will see
Come on, mama
No call you, you call me
If love is true, I will see

No call you, you call me
If love is true, I will see
No call you, you call me
If love is true, I... I... I will see
Yeah! (No call you)

No call you, you call me
If love is true, I will see
No call you, you call me
If love is true, I...
Alright
Yeah
No call you, you call me

Mama, I know you want to
But I won't call you, you will have to call me
Ooh wee, yeah
You... you call me
I called U in the summer
Whenever I'd call your ass up on the phone
(No call you, you call me)
Yeah
Yeah, ooh!
