Song Name: How Does It Go
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I heard about a song that fills your heart with happiness
A special kind of song that only lovers know
I'm told that melody will take away the loneliness
Oh how does it go, oh how does it go

Before I hear that song, I guess better find someone
Someone whose warm caress can make me all a-glow
I hope I find her soon, I long to hear that magic tune
Oh how does it go, oh how does it go

Where are you little girl
Oh won't you hurry to my arms
Where are you little girl
I need to find you so

'Cause I can't bare to live inside this world of loneliness
Without someone to care I just can't get along
Your loves the only song my heart will ever want to know
Oh how does it go, oh how does it go

Well your loves the only song my heart will ever want to know
Oh how does it go, oh how does it go
