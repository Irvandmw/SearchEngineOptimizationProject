Lyrics:


I'm so grateful
I'm so grateful

I thank the boys who kicked my ass when I was seventeen
I thank the ones who chose to laugh and those who acted mean
I thank the bullies for all their scraps and accidents and then some
They shaped my life
They made me like who I've become
They shaped my life
They made me love who I am

I thank the girls who gave their hand and showed me how to dance
And I thank the ones who turned me down and never gave me a second chance
I learned that it's okay for hearts to go on their own way
They shaped my life
They made me like who I am today
They shaped my life
They made me love who I am
That's right
That's right

Now I've got gratitude
Yes, I do
Gratitude
I've got gratitude
Yes, I do
Gratitude

I thank the captains of the boats who braved the seas (Thank you! Thank you!)
And I thank the farmers for the sowing of those seeds (Thank you!)
And I thank the men who paved the roads I'm traveling on (Thank you!)
They shaped my life
They took me down the paths I've gone

I thank the volunteers for giving up their time for free (Thank you!)
I thank the engineers
All those who keep our water clean (Thank you!)
I thank the janitors for all their years behind the scenes (Thank you!)
They shaped my life
They taught me generosity
(YEAH!)
They shaped my life
They helped me see who I could be

Now I've got gratitude
Yes, I do
Gratitude
I've got gratitude
Yes, I do
Gratitude

So grateful
Let me tell you what I'm grateful for

I am grateful for deep breaths
I'm grateful for my health (Grateful! Grateful!)
I know tomorrow is uncertain and I know time is our greatest wealth
I am grateful for my teachers (Teachers!)
And there's many of 'em
They taught me how to follow my heart
They taught me that all of the world is a stage (All of the world is a stage!)
They taught me life imitates art
I am grateful for my parents (Grateful! Grateful!)
And I'm grateful they divorced (Grateful! Grateful!)
When they divided they multiplieded and two parents became four (Grateful! Grateful!)
And I am grateful for my fur friends (Grateful! Grateful!)
The ones that follow me around
Singing "Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow"
They remind me to slow down (Slow down)
To kneel and kiss the ground (Thank you! Thank you!)
I am grateful for music (Music!)
It helps me feel understood (Thank you! Thank you!)
And I'm grateful to Gratitude itself (Thank you!)
It helps me look for the good (Thank you!)
Look for the good (Thank you! Thank you!)
I look for the good (Thank you! Thank you!)
Look for the good
