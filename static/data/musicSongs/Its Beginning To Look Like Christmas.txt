Lyrics:


It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Takes a look in the five and ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
It's the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be on your own front door
A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing within your heart
