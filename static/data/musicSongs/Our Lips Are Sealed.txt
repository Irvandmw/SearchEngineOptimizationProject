Lyrics:


[Haylie:]
Can you hear them?
They talk about us.

[Hilary:]
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise.

[Hayls:]
Can you see them?
See right through them.

[Hil:]
They have no shield
No Secrets to reveal.

[Chorus:]
[Both:]
It doesn't matter what they say.
In the jealous games people play.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
Our Lips Are Sealed.

[Hayls:]
There's a weapon.
Which we must use.

[Hil:]
In our defense.
Silence.

[Hayls:]
Spreading Rumors
So far from true.

[Hil:]
Dragged up from the underworld.
Just like some precious pearl.

[Back to Chorus]

[Hil:]
Pay no mind to what they say
It doesn't matter anyway.
Our Lips Are Sealed.

[Hil:]
Hush my darlin'.

[Hayls:]
Don't you cry.

[Hil:]
Cryin' angels.

[Hayls:]
Forget their lies.

[Back to the top, stop before Hil's part and after the Chorus]

[Both:]
Pay no mind to what they say.

[Both:]
It doesn't matter anyway. Hey, Hey, Hey.

[Repeat:]
Our Lips Are Sealed [3x]
