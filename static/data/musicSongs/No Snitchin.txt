[Bun B (Chorus)]
This is for my gangstas,real niggas,ballas,trill niggas 
North side,South side,chunk ya deuce up 
This is for my gangstas,real niggas,ballas,trill niggas 
East side,West side,chunk ya deuce up 

[Verse 1]
Plenty niggas get they head turned red for da bread 
Start off with da information,load it up in ya head 
Couldnt hold it,so it turned out its sumthin he said 
Wut he tell da FEDS (he need someone to call) 
Your decision was to snitchin and they was there to listen 
When he told what he know,said they barely was trippin 
Less time,now da niggas in a better position 
Unless you count the fact that the streets know he was snitchin 
He was lookin at a 30 but he only did 10, how your years turn to months, can he tell you dat, and 
He aint really gotta answer, just the sweat in his hands 
Will he make it out to make it, mmm well it depends 
Everybody know the info you was tellin ya friends 
Plus the streets know the deals that you made with the pen 
Russian Roulette,yep nigga bet the barrel will spin 
You hear that,yea nigga thats the sound of revenge 

[Hook]
Walk down the right road,cuz the streets is so cold... 
You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it 
Listen to da G-Code,if you know what i kno-oooow, then you'll keep yo mouth closed (keep ur mouth closed nigga) 
We dont tolerate snitches 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If you gon live that crime life,i hope you hold dat 9 tight 
You live life like a pussy then dats prolly what you die like 
I neva eva loved a sucka,them aint really my type 
Rat snakes,yea mayne the game is full of wild-life 
Dont wanna do no time right? 
You wanna live that high life 
Like go withdrawl,have a hundred thousand in ya eye sight 
Enter ya crib,see the clouds peepin through ya skylight 
You be a copycat,(cat),cuz mine right 
Thats what he told me but i didnt listen 
Doin crime for a dime wasnt my intention 
You insane,think his name sumin i will mention 
Only snitches need someone to tell 
Alota niggas in the game,hustlin doin they thing 
Usin codes on the phone with they usual slang 
If you know what he know then you wont say a thing 
You wouldnt need someone to tell 
Careful bout the life you lead,aint smart with ya life, you plead, the streets will ignite ya T, like you aint got the right to breathe 
(Cough) To choke on da realness, reality is what the fake dont know how to deal with 
Words leak from the teeth, but he'll say seal it 
Then go get a undercover brother he can chill with 
Find a nigga that be hustlin to make a deal with 
But the streets will hold court for him and'll deal with it 

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This for the G's,street jugglin,move da fire 
When you talkin what you talkin it aint through the wire 
Police pull you over,now they callin you a liar 
You got amnesia,dont even know the dude beside ya 
You dont know,you aint sayin,you aint heard what he said 
Told you a closed mouth aint gon neva get fed 
A open mouth'll get you county instead of the FEDS 
Some scared niggas speak up so they'll be less in the red 
Niggas cant deal with no 95 so they day-to-day budgeters 
Its the hustlers that get put away by the customers 
You upstate,niggas use to be southerners 
Here the streets make the laws and dont answer the governors 
We the niggas thats too real to snitch on a snitch 
But make a snitch turn to puff with a flick of the wrist 
That aint gon get in arguements,just go get you a clip 
And they gon think about the consequences,let em repent 

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Talking]

Man hold up, you a real nigga and you aint got nuthin to say when they come question you, just keep it 100, and go on a chunk ya deuce up
