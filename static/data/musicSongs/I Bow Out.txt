Lyrics:


Tired of playing this game 
And I wonât play it no more 
And I wonât take it no more 
Through with being your fool 
And I wonât do it no more 
And I wonât, I wonât keep up this act 
Not for one minute 
Iâm gonna pull, Iâm gonna pull this curtain down 

[Chorus:]
This time I wonât play this game 
I made a vow to make a change 
And I bow out 
I wonât be hanging around, baby 
I decline to take the pain 
And I resign the masquerade 
And I bow out 
I wonât be staying around, baby 
I bow out 

Canât go on with the show 
Youâre just a stage I went through 
Now youâre just fading from view, yeah baby 
Itâs time for a change of scene 
Guess Iâll be taking my leave 
I guess I wonât, I wonât stay in this play 
Not for one minute 
Iâm gonna make, Iâm gonna make my exit now 
Oh baby 

[Repeat Chorus]

When youâre left standing on that stage all alone 
Maybe you will realize 
You should of learned to treat me right 
And when this final act is finally through 
Maybe youâll wish youâd been 
The kind of man you should have been 
Now watch me say goodbye 
And walk right out of your life 
Oh baby, all right babe 

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
