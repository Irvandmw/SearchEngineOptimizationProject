Song Name: Outside Of You
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I can't get your attention
And I'm so sick of it
I've got something to say to you
So shut up and listen
I don't want you to look past me
I want you to know who I am
I hate it when you ignore me
You just don't understand
See the funny thing is
You're just as useless as me
I can make you better
If you would just let me in

[Chorus]
I'm outside of you
And I can't get through
Overlooking the beauty that's dying inside me
Cant you see?
I'm outside of you
And I'm so confused
You keep missing the small things
The safety that love brings
Can't you see?

I'm outside of you

For anything to survive
It needs love and light to grow
I could be something beautiful
I guess you'll never know
See the funny thing is
You're just as lonely as me
We could be so much better
If you would just let me in

[Repeat Chorus]

And as you walk by me
I'm silently screaming to set me free
I look in the mirror
And I see your future
You look good with me
And as you walk by me
I'm silently screaming to set me free
I look in the mirror
And I see your future
You look good with me
Oh!

[Repeat Chorus]

I'm outside of you
I'm outside of you
