Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey
Baby, DaBaby, DaBaby, DaBaby, Dababy, DaBaby

Go head and send your location, I'll use the GPS
I say I'm 30 minutes away, I hope you can keep it wet
I'm runnin' red lights tryna get to you, baby
I know you miss me every time somebody mention me, baby
Can't take a picture 'cause you know a nigga Instagram famous
But if you sneak a couple in, make sure you get the right angle
That's all I ask for
Know I'm chocolate don't forget to put on the flash, though
Don't let me catch you, that's why I cut off the last ho
She used to get on my nerve but that bitch was bad, though
She ain't that pretty but nigga look at that ass, though
Ain't puttin' in one of these before my cash flow
I need some manners, the bitches say I'm a asshole
When I'm never worried 'bout her, ayy
I just find this bitch and then I take her
I just give her dick and let you save her
We fuckin' and then we'll see each other later
Nobody know about us but my neighbors
Girl, we gon' fuck around and get in trouble
You know you got a boyfriend, we ain't supposed to cuddle
Somebody bound to tell it on us if we seen in public
I'ma call you sister, your nigga can be my brother
We gon' keep this shit simple, you never gon' meet my mother
Chill out with all the kissing, don't kiss a bitch 'less I love her
Girl, you ain't got nothin' to explain to me
'Cause you can't be my girl, you'll fuck around and do the same to me

And that's why I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
That's why I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
That's why I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
That's why I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, ayy

Hahaha
DaBaby
Send me you location
Ha!
