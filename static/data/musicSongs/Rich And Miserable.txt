Lyrics:


Green grass, hope the cows graze, Hedge Fund, 401
Cake, milk and honey in the land of the free
New York Times, Farmer's Almanac
Too busy to call our mamas
Back porch ain't what it used to be
We don't know what we want
But we want it and we want it all right now

We're too young until we're too old
We're all lost on the yellow brick road
We climb the ladder but the ladder just grows
We're born, we work, we die, it's spiritual
Enough is never enough
American dream never wakes up
Too much is never too much
We won't be happy 'til we're rich and miserable
(We won't be happy 'til we're rich and miserable)

Go to school to get a job
Don't make enough to pay it off
And on and on it goes
Right wing blue jeans, gotta get the new thing
Whatever it takes to make the world look at you, thing

We're too young until we're too old
We're all lost on the yellow brick road
We climb the ladder but the ladder just grows
We're born, we work, we die, it's spiritual
Enough is never enough
American dream never wakes up
Too much is never too much
We won't be happy 'til we're rich and miserable

And maybe we'll get it
(And maybe we'll get it)
Maybe we won't
(Maybe we won't)
But even when we get it
(But even when we get it)
Really we don't

We're too young until we're too old
We're all lost on the yellow brick road
We climb the ladder but the ladder just grows
We're born, we work, we die, it's spiritual
Enough is never enough
American dream never wakes up
Too much is never too much
We won't be happy 'til we're rich and miserable

Come on, get rich and miserable
Come on, get rich and miserable
