Lyrics:


Though you donât call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess Iâll rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I wanna tell you, baby
Changes Iâve been going through (uuuh)
Missing you, listening you
âTill you come back to me thatâs what Iâm gonna do

Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free?
Iâm gonna swallow my pride (my pride)
Iâm gonna beg you to please, baby please see me (you never want to see me)
Iâm gonna walk by myself
Just to prove that my love is true (uuuh)
All for you baby
âTill you come back to me thatâs what Iâm gonna do

Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea (hear my plea)
Iâve got to make you see (make you see)
That our love is dying (our love is dying)

Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must, somehow I must, how I must explain
Iâm gonna rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
Iâm gonna camp by your steps
Until I get through to you (uuuh)
Iâve got to change your view, baby
âTill you come back to me thatâs what Iâm gonna do
âTill you come back to me thatâs what Iâm gonna do
âTill you come back to me thatâs what Iâm gonna do

Iâm gonna rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your window pane (tap on)
Open out baby, Iâm gonna rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your, tap on your (tap on)
Tap on your , tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
Iâm gonna rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your window pane (tap on)
Open out baby
