Lyrics:


Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow

Try to remember when life was so tender
That love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow...

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
That dreams were kept beside your pillow

Deep in December it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made us mellow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
And follow...
