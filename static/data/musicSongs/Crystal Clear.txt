Lyrics:


If you fall I will pick you up
Brush you down and wipe away your tears
When it seems that there's no way out
I'll hold you tight. And scare away your fears

Through the fire and through the rain
One thing's crystal clear
Just remember I'll be here, if you turn around

There will be times when the shadows fall
But I'll be there to guide you through the dark
Imagine the sun is in your eyes
I'll be your shade until the sunset stops

Even though the snow is falling
One thing's crystal clear
Just remember I'll be here, if you turn around

I'll be your castle in the sky
I'll be your comfort, child
I will be your shield, your fan faith trumpeter

Through the storm clouds and the thunder
One thing's crystal clear
Just remember I'll be here, if you turn around

There could be times, much like this
When all you see is way beyond your reach
All years [?] you can't find the door
I'll be there for you. Sleeping at your feet

Through the mist and through the rain
One thing's crystal clear
If you need me I'll be here, if you turn around
Just remember I'll be here, if you turn around
