[Gucci Mane:]
If I told you my cocaine numbers then you probably wouldn't believe me

This the kind a dope that make your uncle sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers then you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas barely 30 talkin' bout they retirin'
This the type of dope that make a junkie sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas in they 30's talkin' bout they retirin'

It was once said by Jada I couldn't quit
Gucci Mane please can I have another hit
The dope man said clark I don't give a shit
As long as your girl kneel down and suck my dick
I'm sellin' coke so clean it make a snorter keep a nose bleed
If you don't know the old me, you don't really know me
I'm from Bouldercrest road b, but you can call it blow street
Where junkies buy 8 ball before they buy some groceries
When you was playing basketball man, I was playing Pimp C
Pocket full of Stones man, standin' on the front street
It's something on your back, it look like a monkey
She can't shake it off man, she keep spendin' money

This the kind a dope that make your uncle sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers then you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas barely 30 talkin' bout they retirin'
This the type of dope that make a junkie sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers then you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas in they 30's talkin' bout they retirin'

[Future:]
Young ass nigga ridin' in a Flying Spur
Young ass niggas out drinkin' on syrup
Young ass nigga and he cookin' up the work
Young ass nigga servin' white, T-shirts
Nelson Mandela, Hood Rockefeller
Denzel bezels, take that shit to trial
Zone 6 nigga rob you for your bricks nigga
Hit a lick nigga, fuck your main bitch nigga
My bitch is caucasian, I live in Las Vegas
That's just on a weekend, that's just when I'm faded
This one is a Maybach, its made by Mercedes
I got baby mommas, they drivin' me crazy

[Gucci Mane:]
This the kind a dope that make your uncle sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers then you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas barely 30 talkin' bout they retirin'
This the type of dope that make a junkie sell his TV
If I told you cocaine numbers you probably wouldn't believe me
If I told you cocaine numbers you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas in they 30's talkin' bout they retirin'
