Lyrics:


This has not been easy
This has been hard
I am scarred
And I do not know what to do with you

I'm going south
Kiss your mouth
Lick my lips
Grab your hips
Can't remember why I fell in love with this

I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh, no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh, no
I don't need you

Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face
So don't go shooting up the place, oh
Make no mistake, your love's not real
'Cause the love I've got is deeper
So much deeper than you could ever feel

And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time oh, no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh, no
'Cause I don't need you tonight

It was really nice to know you
I got nothing left to show you
Got bills to pay, get out the way it's time to move on
And dinner with your boyfriend
Will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him

I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh, no
You beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
So, oh, no, 'cause I don't need you

I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh, no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you, hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
So, no, no, 'cause I won't need you
