Lyrics:


I walk around with my heart in pain
This feeling I can't explain
Such a pounding in my brain
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm in love, in love, I'm in love

I get excited just to hear your name
People think that I'm insane
They don't know that you're to blame
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm in love, in love, I'm in love

I find myself just walkin' the floor
Never felt like this before
Yes you cast a spell on me
And I'm happy as can be

I'm with you baby, through and through
No matter what you say or do
You know my heart belongs to you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm in love, in love, I'm in love

I find myself just walkin' the floor
Never felt like this before
Yes you cast a spell on me
And I'm happy as can be

I'm with you baby, through and through
No matter what you say or do
You know my heart belongs to you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm in love, in love, I'm in love
in love, I'm in love, in love, I'm in love
