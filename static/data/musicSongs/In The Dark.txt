Lyrics:


Girl sitting right down here
Where its not so crowded
He sees you looking but he's not doing anything about it
Baby, you're looking
In the wrong direction
Because this friction between us
Is just straight perfection
(Why you playing hard to get?)
Ooh Ooh
We don't have the time
Just put your lips on mine, fine lady
Ooh Ooh
Don't you be going very far
Just think of all the crazy little things up in your mind that we'd be doing this minute
If we were in the dark
If we we we were in the dark (dark) woah
If we were in the daaaarkkk
The daaaarkkk
If we were in the dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark
(We we we, we were, we were)
She's spending every other night alone
'Coz all them other guys are blowing up her phone
But she really doesn't know
How good it could be
If she rearranged her plans
And made them with me
I'm not into pressing my luck
But your sexy little body has got me stuck
And I know there's something that I miss
But before I go on, let me tell you this
Ooh Ooh
We don't have the time
Just put your lips on mine, fine lady
Ooh Ooh
Don't you be going very far
Just think of all the crazy little things up in your mind that we'd be doing this minute
If we were in the dark
If we we we were in the dark (dark) woah
If we were in the daaaarkkk
The daaaarkkk
If we were in the dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark
(We we we, we were, we were)
Ooh, yeah baby
Would have you to myself
Ooh, ooh
Yeah baby
Don't want nobody else
Heyyy, yeah
Just put your lips on mine, fine lady
Yeahhhhhh
Woahhh
If we were in the dark
If we we we were in the dark (dark) woah
If we were in the daaaarkkk
The daaaarkkk
If we were in the dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark
(We we we, we were, we were)
If we were in the dark
If we we we were in the dark (dark) woah
If we were in the -
If we were in the -
If we were in the dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark
If we we we we we were in the dark
