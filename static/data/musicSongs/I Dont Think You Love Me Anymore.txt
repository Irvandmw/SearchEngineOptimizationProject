Lyrics:


You don't smile like you used to smile
You don't laugh like you used to laugh
You're trying to pretend but what for
I don't think you love me anymore
You don't kiss like you kissed me before
The spark of love isn't there anymore
I love you everyday but what for
I don't think you love me anymore
You made a fool of me you're mean to me
It's plain to see you don't love me anymore
Your loving touch isn't there anymore
You don't care like you cared before
So darling what am I waiting for
I don't think you love me anymore
You made a fool of me you're mean to me
It's plain to see you don't love me anymore
You made a fool of me you're mean to me
It's plain to see you don't love me anymore
