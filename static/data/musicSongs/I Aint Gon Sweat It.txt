Lyrics:


Hook me up, 4

Swear I done took a hunnid losses
Had to stay patient
They seen me come up from nothing
I'm wonderin' why they hatin'
But I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
Swear I done took a hunnid losses
Had to stay patient
They seen me come up from nothing
I'm wonderin' why they hatin'
But I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it

How can I sweat it?
These niggas couldn't be me
These niggas could never be John
These niggas ain't seen what I seen
I was born up in Cleveland, we was in the projects
My mama said, "Fuck that", and we moved to Charlotte
I was on the 7, we lived in apartments
And I spinned that Mario, had me retarded
Was a black ass lil' nigga that always loved talkin'
Always had my chest out, chin up when I walk
Got a 3 story house, big enough for the family
Me and my big brothers thought it was a mansion
My uncles was homeless, my mama took pity
All of 'em smoke crack, they all from Mississippi
All they do is bet, they gon' try to finesse shit
They taught me the game, that's why I'm a finesser
Remember back in the day
High school so back to the K
Ain't have no money to shop
Stole from the mall everyday
Cool would let me wear his Js
My man Denida, he ain't have shit either
His pops in New York, he got everything cheaper
My nigga for life, one time he let me keep her

Swear I done took a hunnid losses
Had to stay patient
They seen me come up from nothing
I'm wonderin' why they hatin'
But I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
Swear I done took a hunnid losses
Had to stay patient
They seen me come up from nothing
I'm wonderin' why they hatin'
But I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it

My name it got hot in the streets while I'm switching the feet and the paint on my car
I see my old hoes and I don't even speak, they like, "Who do you think that you are?"
The same nigga you slept on, I made that ass wake up
Always had bitches, but now that my cake
I done got picky, and fuck who don't like it
These hoes don't excite me, I need some excitement
My shoes are Versace, I'm good on the Nikes
I remember the days that I didn't have shit
Remember the days that I didn't have a whip
Now I got 2, still got my Impala
Was riding with Raider when he had the Honda
Me and McKu and I can't forget Dada
And green for a while, while I was in Costco
Spent 2 years in college, did that for my mama
Dropped out of college, did that for the family
I got the weight of the world on my shoulders
I got the weight on the boat straight from Cali
Honor the pressure, it made me a soldier
Stay out my way, you gon' make me expose ya
100%, and I don't do no folding
Fuck what you think, fuck what you know
Fuck all that talking, fuck what they told ya

Swear I done took a hunnid losses
Had to stay patient
They seen me come up from nothing
I'm wonderin' why they hatin'
But I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
Swear I done took a hunnid losses
Had to stay patient
They seen me come up from nothing
I'm wonderin' why they hatin'
But I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
