Lyrics:


Canât you see?
It wonât mean a thing to me
Iâve been doing this too long
Baby girl, Iâve felt it all
So watch out
If you try to play your luck
Ainât nobody gonna care enough
To catch you fall

[Hook]
So donât you fall in love
Donât make me make you fall in love
Donât make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love
I swear Iâm just a bird
Girl, Iâm just another bird
Donât make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like Me

You tried
You tried to warn me
But baby, Iâm warning you
Girl, Iâll show you
This is no game
Youâll be falling to the point of no return
No return

[Hook]

I know youâre rolling hard with it, donât lie
I know itâs got a hold of you
I know youâre rolling with it
Baby donât you lie
Baby

I know youâre rolling hard with it, donât lie
I know itâs got a hold of you
I know youâre rolling with it
Baby donât you lie
Baby

So donât you fall in love
Donât make me make you fall in love
Donât make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
Cuz girl Iâm just a bird
Iâm just another bird
Donât make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
