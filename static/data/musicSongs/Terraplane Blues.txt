Lyrics:


Well I feel so lonesome
You'll hear me when I moan
And I feel so lonesome
You'll hear me when I moan

Who been drivin' my Terraplane
For you since I been gone?

I'd said, I'll flash your lights, mama
And the horn won't even blow
I even flash my lights, mama
And this horn won't even blow

I got a short in this connection
Way way down below

The coils ain't even buzzin'
The generator won't get that far
All in a bad condition
I gotta have the batteries charged

I'm cryin', please, please don't do me wrong
Who been drivin' my Terraplane?

Mr. Highway man
Please don't block the road
Mr. Highway man
Please, don't block the road

She ran a cold one hundred
Booked and I got to go

I'll get deep down in this connection
Keep on tanglin' with your wires
And when I mash down on your starter
Your spark plug will give me fire

I'm cryin' please, please don't do me wrong
Who been drivin' my Terraplane, I said who, yeah?

Keep on tanglin' with your wires
Whoo
