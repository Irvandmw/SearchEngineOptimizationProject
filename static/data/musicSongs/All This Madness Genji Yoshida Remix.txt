Lyrics:


So I'm a sinner
Isn't everyone?
Everybody wants to be the god they love
I've seen sweet heaven turn into something else
But I've seen sweet heaven

If it gets you by it's precious
But one thing's playing on my mind

All this madness
That's out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

Heroes and heroines embrace in the sun
Blind lead the blind as the sighted run
They've seen sweet heaven turn into something else
But they've seen sweet heaven

She could be my drink or poison
But here's what's playing on my mind

All this madness out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

All this madness out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold
