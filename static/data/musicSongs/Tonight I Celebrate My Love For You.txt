Lyrics:


Tonight I celebrate my love for you, 
It seems the natural thing to do! 
Tonight, no one's going to find us, 
We'll leave the world behind us, 
When I make love to you, tonight! 

Tonight I celebrate my love for you, 
And hope that deep inside you feel it too! 
Tonight our spirits will be climbin' 
To a sky lit up with diamonds! 
When I make love to you, tonight! 

Tonight I celebrate my love for you, 
And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through, 
Tonight, there'll be no distance between us, 
What I want most of you, 
Is to get close to you, 
Tonight! 

Tonight I celebrate my love for you, 
And soon this old world will seem brand new! 
Tonight, we will both discover, 
How friends turn into lovers, 
When I make love to you, tonight!
