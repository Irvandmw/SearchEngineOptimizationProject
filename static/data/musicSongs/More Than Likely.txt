Lyrics:


More than likely you're leading me on, 
More than likely I'll fall, 
More than likely, I'll hear the music, 
Where there's no music at all! 

And, more than likely you'll ask for the stars, 
And I'll reach for a few... 

My heart tells me to run away, 
But that's not so easy to do! 
When it's more than likely I'm so in love, 
And more than likely with you!
