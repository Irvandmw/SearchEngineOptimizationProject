Lyrics:


Sing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
Iâd wager that youâre gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said âYou and your big cheeks have got meâ
Along with âDisarmâ and âFlooded Quarryâ
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the roomâs hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ainât wrong
Heâs got me singing to âAmerikan Folk Songâ
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Donât talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ainât no fake, itâs music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout âWow!â
How did they even have the guts to do it ?
If your nameâs Nizlopi, then there ainât much to it
âCos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now
