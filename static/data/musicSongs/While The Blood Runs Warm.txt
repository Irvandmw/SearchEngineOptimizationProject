Lyrics:


While the blood is running warm in your veins,
While the blood is running so warm in your veins,
You had better get religion, you betta try, try and serve the Lord,
While the blood, the blood is running warm in your veins

Mmmmm now don't forget about your savior while traveling thru this ole sinful land,
for he always willing to help you and he'll lend you a helping hand,
for he bore, he bore the pain of death oooh while he rocked you oh yes he did upon his breast...
hey, while the blood, while the blood is running warm, so warm in your veins

Ohhh Father, while the blood, while the blood is running warm, so warm in your veins,
on Friday mornings, would you believe that I, I got religion and I'm go stay right here and serve the Lord until my dying day,
heyeyey while the blood, the blood is running so warm, so warm in your veins.
