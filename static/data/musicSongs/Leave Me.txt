Lyrics:


Take a look inside
I've got nothing to hide
Oh no
I'll beat around the bush
I've got nothing but time
Oh no oh no

You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got

Leave me leave me I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up I give up
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run

So this is what it feels like
I'll give you the last word
It's alright it's alright it's alright
Now if this is the town this is the place
If you are the one to give disgrace
A name then so be it

You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got

Leave me leave me I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up I give up
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run

Leave me leave me I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up I give up
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run

I'll take my car I'll take my house
I never liked that beat-up motor mouth
And it only looks so warm tonight
Just like a stranger in the candlelight

Take take take take take it all

Leave me leave me I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up I give up
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run

Leave me leave me I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up I give up
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run

Leave me now
Leave me now
