Lyrics:


Some deep shit
Look away

Momma please stop crying, I can't stand the sound
Your pain is painful and it's tearin' me down
I hear glasses breaking as I sit up in my bed
I told dad you didn't mean those nasty things you said

You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter
It ain't easy growing up in World War III
Never knowing what love could be
You'll see
I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family

Can we work it out? (Can we?) Can we be a family? (Can we?)
I promise I'll be better (I promise), Mommy I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave

Daddy please stop yelling (Stop), I can't stand the sound (Can't stand the sound)
Make mama stop crying, 'cause I need you around
My mama she loves you, no matter what she says it's true
I know that she hurts you, but remember I love you, too

I ran away today, ran from the noise, ran away (Ran away)
Don't wanna go back to that place, but don't have no choice, no way
It ain't easy growing up in World War III
Never knowing what love could be
Well I've seen
I don't want love to destroy me like it did my family

Can we work it out? (Can we work it?) Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better, Mommy I'll do anything
(I promise I'll do anything to keep you there)
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better (I promise, I promise), Daddy please don't leave

In our family portrait (In our family portrait) we look pretty happy (We look pretty happy)
Let's play pretend, let's act like it comes naturally
I don't wanna have to split the holidays
I don't want two addresses
I don't want a step-brother anyways
And I don't want my mom to have to change her last name

In our family portrait we look pretty happy
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
Let's play pretend, act like it goes naturally

In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
(I promise I'll be better, Mommy I'll do anything)

In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
Let's play pretend and act like it comes so naturally
(I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave)

In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
(I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave)

In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
(I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave)

Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Turn around please
Remember that the night you left you took my shining star?
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Don't leave us here alone

Mom will be nicer
I'll be so much better, I'll tell my brother
Oh, I won't spill the milk at dinner
I'll be so much better, I'll do everything right
I'll be your little girl forever
I'll go to sleep at night
