Lyrics:


Girl I need you to get in the vibe, but you don't even try
You are the one that I want, yeah you know what I like
Nobody deny it, my bed and your body it's callin'
Come sit on this, yeah, yeah
Come sit on this, let me-

Put it in your body
Don't you give this to anybody
This is mine, all mine
You know I can give you life
Your love so exotic
Come on let's have a private party
Why you puttin' up a fight?
You know I know what you like

So come on and give me that
Give me that, arch your back, let me take control
When the lights down low
When the lights down low
Stop playing with me, this is where you belong
I know you like that though
I know you like that though
Your body on me, quit actin' like you're so shy
When the lights down low
I know you like that though

You got that, got that right
You give me what I like
We put it on the line, you like it
Nobody deny it, my bed and your body it's callin'
Come sit on this, yeah, yeah
Come sit on this, let me-

Put it in your body
Don't you give this to anybody
This is mine, all mine
You know I can give you life
Your love so exotic
Come on let's have a private party
Why you puttin' up a fight? (No, no)
You know I know what you like (Ooh)

So come on and give me that
Give me that, arch your back, let me take control
When the lights down low
When the lights down low
You better stop playing with me, this is where you belong
I know you like that though (Ooh, ooh)
I know you like that though (Yeah)
Your body on me, quit actin' like you're so shy
When the lights down low (Low, ooh, ooh yeah)
I know you like that though (Ooh, ooh)
Give me that, arch your back, let me take control
When the lights down low
When the lights down low

Stop playing with me, this is where you belong
I know you like that though
I know you like that though
Your body on me, quit actin' like you're so shy
When the lights down low
I know you like that though
