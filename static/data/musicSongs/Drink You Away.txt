Lyrics:


Bitter sweet thing.
Could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain.
A tall shot of pain.
Pour a little OUT now for the love that we've made.

I feel it in the morning.
Youâre still here in the morning.
I see you but you're gone
Telephone a doctor: Iâm not okay.
The bottom of the bottle
To fill this empty heart up.
A thousand proof
Donât change the truth.
I dive in but I canât.

I canât drink you away.
Iâve tried Jack, Iâve tried Jim,
Iâve tried all of their friends.
But I canât drink you away.
All these rocks
I canât swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.
Say

Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break, ooh?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heart break?

Got a pounding on my brain.
So I drowned it away.
When the sun comes up tomorrow you can find me doing the same.
'Cause I just canât forget
The way we turned out this bad/bed.
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead.

And then I feel it in the morning.
Youâre still here in the morning.
I see you but you're gone.
Telephone a doctor: Iâm not okay.
Bottom of the bottle
To fill this empty heart up.
A thousand proof
Donât change the truth.
I dive in but I canât.

I canât drink you away.
Iâve tried Jack, Iâve tried Jim,
Iâve tried all of their friends.
But I canât drink you away (no, I can't).
All these rocks
I canât swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.
Say

Tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break?
Oh, tell me, baby, one time, come on, don't they make a medicine for heart break?

Break it down

I canât drink you. No, I canât drink you away, away.
I canât drink you. I canât drink you away, away.
I canât drink you. I canât drink you away, away.
Oh, I canât drink you. No, I canât drink you away, away.

I canât drink you away.
Iâve tried Jack, Iâve tried Jim,
Iâve tried all of their friends.
But I canât drink you away.
All these rocks
I canât swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.
Say

So tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break (don't they, don't they, tell me, baby)?
Oh, tell me baby, one time, don't they make a medicine for heart break, yeah?

Tell me, baby, can't they make a medicine for my heart break, heart break?
Tell me, baby, yeah, can't they make a medicine for my heart break?

'Cause I can't drink you away.
Iâve tried Jack, Iâve tried Jim,
Iâve tried all of their friends.
I canât drink you away.
All these rocks
I canât swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.
