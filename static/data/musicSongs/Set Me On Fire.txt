Lyrics:


Feel like I'm staring at the sun but I feel no pain
Got a feeling in my heart that I can't explain
These walls I've built they all fall down to you

And it's a rush like a river that runs through me
I get caught in your tide like I can't believe
You hold me like an open fire in you

And my heart beats loud like a thousand drums
Feeling love like the city where I come from
I've got a hole in my heart that I can't explain for you

And you set me on fire... you set me on fire
You set me on fire... you set me on fire
You set me on fire... you set me on fire
And you set me on fire... you set me on fire

Whoa-u-u-u-u... u-u-u-u.

I've been everywhere on earth and I still can't find
A feeling that compares to your blinding light
These doors I've locked they all open for you

And it's a rush like a river that runs through me
I get caught in your tide like I can't believe
You hold me like an open fire in you

And my voice sings loud like a thousand drums
Feeling love like the city where I come from
I've got a hole in my heart that I can't explain for you

And you set me on fire... you set me on fire
And you set me on fire... you set me on fire
You set me on fire... you set me on fire
And you set me on fire... you set me on fire

Burn me with your love so bright
Burn me like an open fire
Burn me with your love so bright
So I can feel you... I can feel you...

Burn me with your love so bright
Burn me like an open fire
Burn me with your love so bright
So I can feel you... I can feel you...
