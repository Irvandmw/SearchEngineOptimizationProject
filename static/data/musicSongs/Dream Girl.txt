Lyrics:


Playing my fantasy
There is no gravity
The heaven so blue and rare
The magic in the air
Facing an empty space
Nobody can replace
How could you disappear
Without a care

How many sheeps have I counted
Because of you
My love
How many stars did I wish upon
Only for us
My love

Dream girl missing
I'm always kissing
Your soul
When I'm a sleep
Dream girl talking
Don't leave me walking alone
I'm in too late

Maybe my eyes won't see
The naked reality
Maybe my ears won't hear
The truth that I can't bear

How many stars did I wish upon
Only for us
My love

Dream girl missing
I'm always kissing
Your soul
When I'm a sleep
Dream girl talking
Don't leave me walking alone
I'm in too late
Oh

Baby can't you see
You belong to me
Right here
Right now
So naturally
Oh

Dream girl missing
I'm always kissing
Your soul
When I'm a sleep
Dream girl talking
Don't leave me walking alone
I'm in too late

Dream girl missing
I'm always kissing
Your soul
When I'm a sleep
