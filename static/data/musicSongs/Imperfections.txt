Lyrics:


I try to give all of myself to you
But before I can get there
I've got parts of me I'm trying to lose

Yeah I got my own imperfections
I got my own set of scars to hide
I got my own imperfections
I can't hold your heart when I'm fixing mine

So give it up, give it up
I ain't gonna save you
Give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up
I ain't gonna save you
Give it up, give it up now

Cuz I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
Yeah I got my own, I got my own

Hold on
Not tryna put you on the shelf
But before I could love you
I need to learn to love myself

Cuz I got my own imperfections
I got my own set of scars to hide
I got my own imperfections
I can't hold your heart when I'm fixing mine

So give it up, give it up
I ain't gonna save you
Give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up
I ain't gonna save you
Give it up, give it up now

Cuz I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
Yeah I got my own, I got my own

They're part of me and you are too
And I don't really want to choose
Can you love them the way that I love you?
They make me who I am today
And they will never go away
Can you love them the way that I love you?

Cuz I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
Yeah I got my own, I got my own

Before I can love you (Before I can love you)
I need to learn to love myself (I got to learn)
Before I can trust you (Before I can trust you)
I need to learn to trust myself (I need, I need)
(Before I can love you)
(I got to learn)
(Before I can trust you)
