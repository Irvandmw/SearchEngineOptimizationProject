Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Like bright lightning
It happened from above
You sent me down somebody
Somebody to love

My life was stormy skies
Emptiness and pain
You sent your sunshine down
To drive away the rain

When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me happiness
When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me gladness
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Just like a summer sun
Chased away the nightime
It felt so lonely then
Now it's just the right time

And when you touched my hand
The sun began to shine
And when you smiled at me
I knew that love was mine

When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me happiness
When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me gladness
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me happiness
When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me gladness
Oh yeah

When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me happiness
When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me gladness

When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me happiness
When the sun shined its face on me
It brought me gladness
