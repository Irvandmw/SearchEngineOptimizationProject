Lyrics:


A train went past the window
To interrupt the night
The waiting hours of morning
Seemed further from his sight

The wet wall by the playground 
Glistened through the rain
And crying seemed as natural 
As parents always claim

Silence makes the memory loud
And silence makes me pray
Though empty hearts can beat as loud
As full ones during the day

Sorrow that a desperate man
Can chase away with light
Always finds his spirit weak
When evening turns to night

The Kings Cross train slows down at night
When the sky is dark
Right next to the infant school
Opposite the park

Rain falls down on Abbeyhill
Memories start to shout 
As sky and locomotive 
Let the tears run out
