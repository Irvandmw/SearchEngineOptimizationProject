Lyrics:


That second that I met her
It was like I found a treasure
And I swore I'd never let her get away

She's what you call a keeper
And she's made me a believer
The girls like that don't come around every day

When you find one like mine
No, you don't take for granted
That angel you've been handed
When she loves the way she loves
And you're looking in those eyes
You'll know it when you find
One like mine

When you find your one and only
And she lays her body on you
You're kissing all that loneliness goodbye

After all those nights of looking
I stumbled on a good one
And the only question I had in my mind
Was where have you been all my life

When you find one like mine
No, you don't take for granted
That angel you've been handed
When she loves the way she loves
And you're looking in those eyes
You'll know it when you find
One like mine

You're gonna hit your knees
You're gonna thank the Lord
You're gonna know you found
The one you're looking for

When she loves the way she loves
And you're looking in those eyes
You'll know it when you find
You'll know it when you find

When you find one like mine
No, you don't take for granted
That angel you've been handed
When she loves the way she loves
And you're looking in those eyes
You'll know it when you find
You'll know it when you find
One like mine

Oh, one like mine
One like mine
