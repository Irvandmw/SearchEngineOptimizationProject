Lyrics:


She was a lonely type
Her heart can not disguise
Her passion...for life

She had a love for art
(art)
Painted pictures with her heart
She's One (she's one)...Of a kind

She's standing tall
She's got it all
She's everything
I'm looking for
Ooh

She's standing tall
She's got it all
She's everything
(everything)
I'm looking for

[Chorus:]

If you want me like I want you
If you need me like I need you
Its alright

If you love me like I love you
Let me be the one to hold you
Through the night

We'll be walking though leaves
When summers gone
We'll carry on

We'll be walking through leaves
When summers gone
We'll carry on

I am a simple man
Take pride in what I am
Got passion
(passion)
For life
(for life)
Don't think I'm like the rest
With my heart up on my chest
I try to...Be kind

She's standing tall
She's got it all
yehhh
She's everything
I'm looking for
Ooh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

She's standing tall
She's got it all
(got it all)
She's everything that I'm looking for
Yeah

[Chorus:]

If you want me like I want you
If you need me like I need you
Its alright

If you love me like I love you
(if you want me)
Let me be the one to hold you
(if you need me)
Through the night

We'll be walking though leaves
When summers gone
We'll carry on
(ooh we'll carry on)
(ooh we'll carry on)

We'll be walking through leaves
When summers gone
We'll carry on

Somehow I do believe
Some things are meant to be yeah......

[Chorus:]

If you want me like I want you
If you need me like I need you
Its alright

(yeah.....)

If you love me like I love you
(if you want me)
Let me be the one to hold you
Through the night
(ooh yeahhhhh)

We'll be walking though leaves
When summers gone
We'll carry on

We'll be walking through leaves
When summers gone
We'll carry on
