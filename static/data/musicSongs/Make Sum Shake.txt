Lyrics:


(Ay man)
I bet something shake (It's DaBaby, bitch)
I bet something shake
Look
I bet something shake (I don't know 'bout these other niggas man)
I bet something shake (But for me, Baby Jesus, DaBaby? Me and my niggas?
I bet something shake (We gon' make something shake, nigga)
I bet something shake (Quit looking for handouts nigga)
Look (Let's go! Aw shit)
I bet something shake (I thought it was gon' drop it, but we gon' leave it anyway)
I bet something shake
I bet something shake (DaBaby, yeah!)

I bet I make something shake
I try not to get in the way
I'ma buy me a nigga today
Prolly rob me a nigga today
I'm tryna go on vacation
And I'm tryna go with your bae
I told her I'm patiently waitin'
She say she don't know what to say

(I told her I was tryna take her on vacation)
I bet something shake
I bet something shake
(She said, uh, I don't know, you better watch him)
Yeah

I bet I make something shake
I try not to get in the way
I'ma buy me a nigga today
Prolly rob me a nigga today
I'm tryna go on vacation
And I'm tryna go with your bae
I told her I'm patiently waitin'
She say she don't know what to say

These niggas know they wanna be me, be patient, I'm just gettin' started
Was guaranteed to make the TV, you play me, it's gon' get retarded
I got in the club with my pistol, I cut up and shut down the party
Ain't worried about none of these niggas 'cause I'ma do my thing regardless
They say I put on for my city, they say that I put on for Charlotte
I'm busting jiggs at my shows, just pulled up and I seen 'em chargin'
I'm not a local celebrity, all of this shit, it took off unexpectedly
I tell the truth, I don't speak hypothetically
Do what I did and I do it successfully
Pull up in a whip with a bitch from the other side
She told me to pull out my dick 'cause she want a ride (Pull it out, let me see it, damn
Okay, at the next red light, I got ya
She do her thang with that head, she a monster
She gon' cut up 'cause she fuck with the baby
After she tell you what up with dababy
