Lyrics:


Ya sing, ya shout, ya turn the world around
Yeah, we come out together for you

Ya let me see the man I'm gonna be
Yeah, we come out together for you

Remember to shine
Let my love take you high
You've nothin' to lose
Yer just a boy with the blues

Ya take a vow never to back down
Yeah, we come out together for you

And my dreams are bound to come true somehow
Yeah, we come out together for you

Remember to shine
Let my love take you high
You've nothin' to lose
Yer just a boy with the blues
Remember to smile
Let my love take you high
I'm nothin' to lose
I'm just a boy with the blues
Yeah

Come out together, come out together
Come out together for you...
