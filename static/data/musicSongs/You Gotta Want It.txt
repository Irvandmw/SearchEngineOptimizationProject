Lyrics:


You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it

Donât sit there while you waste away
Tied up in what youâre not
I watched you slowly fade away
Laid out and left to rot

Wake up now
Youâre getting closer
The time is now
To start it over
Take back your heart
Take back your pride
Kick out the demon thatâs living inside

You gotta want it
You gotta want it
Because nothing happens if youâre sitting on your ass
And if youâre bleeding
You will believe it
Youâre busy dying if youâre living in the past

Whoa, you gotta want it
Whoa, you gotta want it
Whoa, you gotta want it
Whoa, you gotta want it

I hear you beg for sympathy
It always sounds the same
You play your self loathing symphony
Thereâs no one left to blame

Shut up now
Start it over
Live out loud
You got it going
Take back your heart
Take back your pride
Digging out the stranger thatâs buried inside

You gotta want it
You gotta want it
Because nothing happens if youâre sitting on your ass
And if youâre bleeding
You will believe it
Youâre busy dying if youâre living in the past

Whoa, you gotta want it
Whoa, you gotta want it
Whoa, you gotta want it
Whoa, you gotta want it

I feel you
You see Iâm broken all the way through
But if you could see you like I do
You got this
You find your way out
Nothing with last
Everything changes
Watch it pass

Nothing happens when youâre sitting on your ass
Youâre busy dying if youâre living in the past

You gotta want it
You gotta want it
Because nothing happens if youâre sitting on your ass
And if youâre bleeding
You will believe it
Youâre busy dying if youâre living in the past

You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it

Whoa, you gotta want it
Whoa, you gotta want it

You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it
You gotta want it
