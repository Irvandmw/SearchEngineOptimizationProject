Lyrics:


No, woman, no cry.
No, woman, no cry.
No, woman, no cry.
No, woman, no cry.

'Causeâ'causeâ'cause I remember when a we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown,
Obâobserving the hypocrites.
Yeah!
Mingle with the good people we meet.
Yeah!

Good friends we have. Oh.
Good friends we have lost along the way. Yeah!
In this great future you can't forget your past.
So dry your tears, I say.
Yeah.

No, woman, no cry.
No, woman, no cry. Eh, yeah!
A little darlin', don't shed no tears.
No, woman, no cry. Eh!

Saidâsaidâsaid I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown. Yeah.
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,
I say, log wood burnin' through the nights.
Yeah!

Then we would cook cornmeal porridge,
I say, of which I'll share with you.
Yeah!
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through.

But while I'm gone,
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right-a!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah!
Everything's gonna be all right!

So, no, woman, no cry.
No, woman, no cry.
I say, oh, littleâoh, little darlin', don't shed no tears.
No, woman, no cry. Eh.

No, womanâno, womanâno, woman, no cry.
No, woman, no cry.
One more time I got to say,
Oh, little-little darlin', please don't shed no tears.
No, woman, no cry.
