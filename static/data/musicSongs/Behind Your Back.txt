Lyrics:


I've been talking about you
Behind your back
I've been telling people that I've heard things
If they ask
If we ease up and burning up
Well, it's a fact
I've been talking about you
Every chance I had

Is nothing bad, is all I have
It's just a chance to say your name, baby
Is nothing bad, is just a chance
Wanna talk about you
Behind your back

I've been talking about you
Behind your back
I know that talking is cheap
But baby, do the math
You were one in a million
And my whole heart's in half
Have is never conscious, it's a word I have

I've been telling all my stories to anyone that asks
I've been serving them up in a half-empty glass
Don't go thinking I've lost all my class
When I'm talking about you

Is nothing bad, is all I have
It's just a chance to say your name, baby
Is nothing bad, is just a chance
Wanna talk about you
Behind your back

Is nothing bad, is all I have
It's just a chance to say your name
Again, baby, just a chance
It's all I have
Wanna talk about you
Behind your back
No, is nothing bad
Is all I have
I'm hoping you'd give me just a chance
If you came back
Another chance
To stop taking about you
Behind your back
