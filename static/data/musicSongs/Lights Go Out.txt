Lyrics:


I've been trying, there's no denying
That girl you've got my heart falling so fast
My minds racing, you've got me wasting
My days were endless till I see you pass

And I'm like, (Ooo-ooo)
Baby did I catch your eye? (Ooo-ooo)
Can I see you tonight?

When the lights go out, You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone, You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
Come home with me

Take my hand girl, we'll cross this land till
We find a place that we can call our own
Trust in me and I'll set you free
Babe I'm never ever leave you feeling cold

You got me like, (Ooo-ooo)
Tell me I'm the only one (Ooo-ooo)
And I'll see you tonight

When the lights go out, You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone, You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me, with me
With me me, me, me, me, me, me

When the lights go out, You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone, You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
Come home with me
When the lights go out, You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone, You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
Come home with me
