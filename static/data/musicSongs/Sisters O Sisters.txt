Lyrics:


We lost our green land
We lost our clean air
We lost our true wisdom
And we live in despair

Sisters, O sisters
Lets stand up right now
It's never too late
To start from the start

O wisdom, O wisdom
That's what we ask for
And yes, my dear sisters
We must learn to ask

Wisdom, O wisdom
That's what we ask for
That's what we live for now

Wisdom, O wisdom
That's what we ask for
That's what we live for now

Sisters, O sisters
Let's wake up right on
It's never too late
To shout from our hearts

O freedom, O freedom
That's what we fight for
And yes, my dear sisters
We must learn to fight

Freedom, O freedom
That's what we ask for
That's what we live for now

Freedom, O freedom
That's what we ask for
That's what we live for now

O sisters, O sisters
Let's give up no more
It's never too late
To build a new world

O new world, O new world
That's what we live for
And yes, my dear sisters
We must learn to live

New world, O new world
That's what we live for
That's what we must now learn to build

O new world, O new world
That's what we live for
That's what we must now learn to build

New world, O new world
That's what we live for
That's what we must now learn to build

New world, O new world
That's what we live for
That's what we must learn to build
