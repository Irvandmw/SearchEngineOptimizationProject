Lyrics:


Rubbing on that Italian leather
Them Konvict jeans on!
Ay yo Weezy! You Ready?

I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming, "Ah!"
I'm so paid
Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustler don't need them
One of ya'll ya see!
I'm so paid

I see police on the crooked I
Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95
My shawty leanin' blasting that Do or Die
Wishin' that a motherfucker would 'cause we're certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
I'm a sniper sitting on the roof already saw you all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make the name of me
That's why

I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming, "Ah!"
I'm so paid
You boo
Number one hustler gettin' money
I told you I had you
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler
Akon
Don't need them
One of ya'll ya see!
I gotcha you nigga
I'm so paid

[Young Jeezy:]
She said Young why your voice so hoarse?
I just sound like money
Baby I should've been a Porsche
Paint lookin' like a sugar free RedBull
I'm so paid
You know I keep a pocket full
And that's before the taxes
Took my whole gross net and hid it under my mattress
I used to get bored and count 20s for practice what
Paper therapy we let the money relax us
Gold chains 'round my neck
Just like Michael Phelps
I made a killin' in the water
Killin' with the water
Against all odds and I will not stop
They try to keep me on bottom
But I prefer the top
And my project chick I moved her next to Joc
She said the house was too small I moved her next to Block
So baby get your ass up I need an extra block
I told her do the speed limit and no extra stops
And that's why

I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming, "Ah!"
I'm so paid
Number one hustler gettin' money
What's up? What's up?
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler don't need them
One of ya'll ya see!
I'm so paid

I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off that's all
Guess what I won't be taking that fall
Homie I got cake that's what I'm paying them for
Ain't that funny?
'Cause niggas they want war but ain't got money
'Cause I've seen them all talking 'til they start gunning
Quicker than Usain Bolt the fastest thing running
Akon! Weezy! Jeezy
Block oil holdin' down Jersey
Divine making sure we gettin' it up front
My little brother Boo got that vision baby

I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming, "Ah!"
I'm so paid
Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustler don't need them
One of ya'll ya see!
I'm so paid

[Lil Wayne:]
Big money Weezy
White wife beater with the SIG underneath it
How do I feel bitch I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers disappear from the precinct
I'm ballin' we ball out
Ball 'til we fall, until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns to your house
Only to find out you live in a doll house damn!
But I thought you was tough though
We carry choppers on our necks
Call it cut throat
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic turn
We smoke to gun smoke
We bomb first when we ride
You in a hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down baby
And I'm holding down young mula baby!
That's why

I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming, "Ah!"
I'm so paid
Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustler don't need them
One of ya'll ya see!
I'm so paid
