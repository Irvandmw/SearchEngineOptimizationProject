Lyrics:


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me
When will you forget my past?
Got questions, ask, you know the stories
And you need to let me know
When you leave and when you go
Can I come?
Do you believe me are you close?
Yeah
Even if you don't that'll get you sprung

Do I? Do I? Do I?
Look
Can I? Can I? Can I?
Get a look

Yeah, don't run away love
Hate love
Heart break will have you bankrupt
Too many days in the days better wake up
I'll put your face in the place where the space was
Nobody make you feel like you but (Do I?)
And you don't know what you should do
You just lookin' for someone to make you move
Oh tell me (Do I?)

I'll make this planet feel like home
Reach that first time the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You say this song
So close to broken

So much better when you wait
Forever and a day
It's all I got
Yeah
Put it together then it break
All the energy it take
And now it's dark

Do I? Do I? Do I?
Look
Can I? Can I? Can I?
Get a look

Yeah, I never slip I never fall
I try to tell you 'bout a better life you get involved
Big or small
It's been your fault
I keep you safe
It's in the vault
Blinded folded keep it going till we hit a wall
Yeah
I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up
We can only go up

I'll make this planet feel like home
Reach that first time the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You say this song
So close to broken
Do I? Do I? Do I?
Look
Can I? Can I? Can I?
Get a look
