Lyrics:


It was the hottest summer - I was seventeen
You were a little older
Yeah - the best I'd ever seen

We were young and foolish
Only out for laughs
Didn't realise that time, would fly so fast

Miss America, tell me where you are
Can't believe I've gone and lost you
Just a photograph, just a memory - to me, yeah
We were so misunderstood, thought we had it good
Were just too young to know it
And now, I remember the way we were
Miss America

I could hear your laughter - like it was yesterday
You would put your hair up, I'd take it down, I liked it that way
We stayed up late and counted stars, from the back seat of my car
You said it's love I said okay, didn't know what else to say

Miss America, tell me where you are
Can't believe I've gone and lost you
Just a photograph, just a memory - to me, yeah
We were so misunderstood, thought we had it good
Were just too young to know it
Even now, I remember the way we were
Miss America

Oh we traced our name out in the stars
Yeah the whole world was ours

I'm ready, I'm ready for - the way we were way back before
We both grew up and you left town
But miss USA where are you now?
Tell me - I've gone and lost you

Just a photograph, just a memory to me - yeah
We were so misunderstood, thought we had it good
Just too young to know it
And now, I remember the way we were
I can't forget - the way we were
It was good, miss America
