Lyrics:


[Both] Open up the doghouse
[Both] Open up the doghouse
[Both] Rover Rover move it over two cats are coming in

[D] Nat you look like a man with a story [N] I sure have
[N] I told my wife we oughta save money
[N] That's the way it's gotta be [D] Oh gotta gotta be that way
[N] She cancelled all the charge accounts gave all the gold to me
[D] Well I can't see what you did wrong
[D] Why was your woman so upset
[N] Well I put the money on a horse and he hasn't showed up yet

[Both] Open up the doghouse
[Both] Open up the doghouse
[Both] Rover Rover move it over two cats are coming in

[N] Well Dean what's your problem [D] Here it is
[D] I gave my wife a beautiful fur coat [N] You did
[D] Told her it was genuine mink [N] Rich man
[D] I took her out to show it off
[D] Then we stopped in for a drink [N] Oh cocktails
[N] We I know your wife was really thrilled
[N] How come you two had a spat
[D] It's easy to see it started to rain the coat got wet
[D] And mink just don't smell like that [N] Timber

[Both] Open up the doghouse
[Both] Open up the doghouse
[Both] Rover Rover move it over two cats are coming in

[D] Let's hear it Nat [N] You know what you know what though
[D] What
[N] There's just one way to handle a woman
[N] Dean we just got to treat 'em rough [D] Got to slap 'em
[N] That's right [D] We got to show 'em who wears the pants
[D] Cut out that sisssy sissy stuff
[N] Now it ain't no use to take abuse
[N] Whenever they are cranky or cross
[Both] Let's put the women in their place and we'll show them who's the boss

Open up the doghouse
Two cats are coming in
