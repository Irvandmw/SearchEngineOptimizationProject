Lyrics:


Everywhere a wilderness
We're all out of our minds
Everyone's an animal
Even you and I
Everywhere a wilderness
The concrete to the pines
Everywhere a wilderness
There's no place you can hide
Everywhere a wilderness
We're all out of our minds
Everyone's an animal
But you're my favorite kind
Everywhere a wilderness
The wolves come out at night
Everywhere a wilderness
So won't you hold me tight
