Lyrics:


Oh, oh

Ooh, here I go again
Falling in love all over
Ooh, the cycle never ends
You just pray you don't get burned

Ooh, this fire inside of me
Don't nobody realize
Oh, what you are to me
But baby, you got to learn

I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about you
How I always want you near

I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm counting every minute of every hour
Till you are here

Girl, can you understand
I never used to go dancing
I, I was the kind of man who would rather stay at home
Now, when I think about how much I miss you
I want to jump for joy
And thank Him I'm not alone (I am not alone)

Oh, I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about you baby
How I always want you near

I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm gonna count every minute of every hour
Until you are here (till you are here)

Oh oh (oh oh oh)
Hey, hey
Here I go again
Falling in love all over
Oh, the cycle never ends (cycle never endin')
You pray you don't get burnt, ow

I'm making you a coat (I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere)
Cashmere, baby, cashmere (you got to know how I feel about you)
You got to know (how I always want you near)
Yeah baby, baby, baby, baby (I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere)
How I feel about you, how I feel about you
(I'm gonna count every minute of every hour)
(Until you are here)

When I get my arms around you baby (yeah)
So many things I'm gonna do (pink cashmere)

I'm gonna hug you (you got to know how I feel about you)
I'm gonna kiss you (how I always want you near)
Like your, like your guru (I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere)

I want to tell you a bedtime story baby
I you never heard before (I'm counting every minute of every hour, every hour)
I said one you never heard before (how I feel about you)

About a girl (coat of pink cashmere)
About a boy
And all their joy
All the things they show each other (coat of pink cashmere)
How to stay in love
How to stay so happy

Baby girl (coat of pink cashmere)
So many things
So many things
I'm gonna do

Can't you come to me? (Coat of pink cashmere)
Can't you get to me?
I'm gonna make gonna I'm gonna gonna gonna 'onna
I'm gonna make a little pretty pink coat of cashmere

'Cause you've got to know
How I feel about you, babe
How I feel about you, babe
I'm gonna make a little pretty coat
I'm gonna count every second, every minute
Each and every hour of every day
Till you come on back
Come on back to your little man

Gonna make you a coat of cashmere, baby
