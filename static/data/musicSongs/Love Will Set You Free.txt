Lyrics:


Iâm sure youâre probably busy getting on with your new life
So far away from
So far away from

When everything we used to say was wrong is now alright
Where has the time gone
Where has the time gone

If youâre ever feeling lonely
If youâre ever feeling down
You should know youâre not the only one âcause I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders and youâre falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free

I took a long and lonely walk up to an empty house
Thatâs where Iâve come from
Where have you come from

The more I live, the more I know, Iâve got to live without
This ainât no sad song
Life has to go on

If youâre ever feeling lonely
If youâre ever feeling down
You should know youâre not the only one âcause I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders and youâre falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free

Ooh
You know love will set you free [x6]

Love will set you free
Ooh
Love will set you free

If youâre ever feeling lonely
If youâre ever feeling down
You should know youâre not the only one âcause I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders and youâre falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free
Love will set you free
