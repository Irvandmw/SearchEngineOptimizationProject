Lyrics:


Thinkin' about your lips and the way they kiss
There's so much I really miss about you
Sittin' on the beach, you were still in reach
And I haven't felt free without you
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, is tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

So I lay a dozen roses for the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses, I lay them there, I lay them there for you

You've been on my mind every single night
I can't visualize life without you
I've been tryin' to go a week without losing sleep
But there's something that I need to go through
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, is tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

So I lay a dozen roses for the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses, I lay them there, I lay them there for you
I lay them there for you

So I lay a dozen roses for the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses, I lay them there, I lay them there for you
