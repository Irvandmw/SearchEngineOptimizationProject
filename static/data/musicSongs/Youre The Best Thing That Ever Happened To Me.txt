Lyrics:


I've had my share of life's up and downs
But fate's been kind the downs have been few
I guess you could say that I've been lucky
Oh I guess you could say it's all because of you

And if anyone should ever write my life story
Oh whatever reason there might be
You'll be there between each line of pain and glory
Cause you're the best thing that's ever happened to me
You're the best thing that ever happened to me

Lord there have been times when times were hard
But always somehow I made it through
Cause for every moment I've spent hurting
There was a moment I've spent loving you

And if anyone should ever write my life story...
