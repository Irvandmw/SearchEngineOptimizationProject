Lyrics:


Struggling to pull down his cagoule
A silent scholar leaves the library
Stumbling his way downstairs
He's wearing far too many layers
But feels the gentle summer air
Is not reality

And he gets what he gets
Life deceives him yet
Look at him and you'll discern
Someone who's really trying to learn
Leave his zeal to congeal
On his spinning wheel
And he will stretch it out
Until it's clear that there is nothing to reveal

Waking to an early summer dawn
I lie in bed and dream the day away
Seeing how events will pan out
I don't have to rush to get out
Of this over-heated pit to face reality

And I get what I get
Life deceives me yet
Look at me and you'll discern
Someone who's never tried to learn
Leave my zeal to congeal
On my spinning wheel
And I will stretch it out
Until it's clear that there is nothing to reveal

Here it comes again
That old feeling that
I'm not good enough
And where I am sat
The birdsong I can hear
Consoles me with the thought
That my own vanity
Soon will count for nought

In a large Newcastle hotel room
Casanova copulates again
Technique being of the very best
He's scooshing each and every test
And feels inside his lover's breast
His own reality

And we get what we get
Life deceives us yet
Not that it's of your concern
But we've learned all there is to learn
Leave our zeal to congeal
On the spinning wheel
And we will stretch it out
Until it's clear that there is nothing
We will stretch it out
Until it's clear that there is nothing
We will stretch it out
Until it's clear that there is nothing to reveal

We will stretch it out (we will stretch it out)
Until it's clear that there is nothing
We will stretch it out (we will stretch it out)
Until it's clear that there is nothing
We will stretch it out
Until it's clear that there is nothing to reveal
