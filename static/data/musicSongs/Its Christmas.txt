Lyrics:


Sleigh bells are in the atmosphere
Keepin' the spirit alive
Sugar belles out on the shopping spree
Makin' sure the kids are alright
Could it be a major movie's comin' in
From the heavens above
A big plate of my mama's cookin' brings
The feeling of love

Oh, how I wish I had my way
I'd stay forever and a day

Feel just like Christmas
Baby, love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Just like Christmas
Hear the bells just ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along

Everything the kids ever want is here
From the toys to the shoes
Santa Claus getting closer and closer
I heard some talk on the news
Baby, it's time to take a load off
Come in and take your coat off and chill
Settle down, your family and friends in here
Can't explains how it feels

Come on, if I can have my way
I'd stay forever and a day

Feel just like Christmas
Baby, love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Just like Christmas
Hear the bells just ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along

Feel just like Christmas
Baby, love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Just like Christmas
Hear the bells just ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
And the spirit wants to take me higher
Oh Lord, and if I had my way
I'd give up all I own to stay and have my family home
Nothing really matters, as long as I can feel this way

Baby, love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Feel just like Christmas
Hear the bells just ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along

Just like Christmas
Baby, love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Feel just like Christmas
Hear the bells just ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along
Just like Christmas

Feel like Christmas
Just like Christmas
Feel like Christmas
Just like Christmas
