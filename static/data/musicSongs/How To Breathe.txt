Lyrics:


You say I need prescribing
A dose of your company
But can you teach me what I wanna learn?
Can you give me what it is I yearn?
You say you'd like a chance
You say you'd like a second glance

And I say
Life breathes life
Life needs it
Oh, teach me how to breathe
And take me there

Oh, I know I need to get away
Just discover what I won, gem, and have a play
But I've never needed anyone before
Aren't you sick of always giving more?
I might chew you up and spit you out, clenched fist
Are you willing to take that risk?

Oh yeah, life breathes life
Life needs it
Oh, teach me how to breathe
And take me there
...
