Lyrics:


I only want what's the best thing for you
And the best thing for you would be me
I've been convinced after thinking it through
That the best thing for you would be me

Everyday to myself I say
Point the way, what will it be?
I ask myself, what's the best thing for you?
And myself and I seem to agree
That the best thing for you would be me

Everyday to myself I say
Point the way, what will it be?
I ask myself, what's the best thing for you?
And myself and I seem to agree
That the best thing for you would be me
