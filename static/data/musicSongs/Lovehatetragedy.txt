Lyrics:


Human behavior 
Peculiar it seems 
Some thrive on hate 
Some love the dream 
Everyone's got a purpose and wants to be loved 
I think I found my purpose 
I think I found love 

Hidden inside myself 

Tragedy 
Strikes when you least expect it 

Hate and destruction crashed down on our world 
The stars and the stripes 
The boys and the girls 
It's sad it took war just to bring us together 
I believe in love 
I believe in forever 

Hidden inside ourselves 

You better run 
You better run 
For your life 
For your life 
Shed a tear 
Shed a tear 
Live in fear 

Tragedy day 
Tragedy day 
Tragedy day
