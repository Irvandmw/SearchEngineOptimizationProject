Song Name: Shadow Side Of Me
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I feel your resistance in your body
though you try to hide it
I know there's a battle in your mind

I'm feeling the distance
You are drifting and I just can't fight it
How do we go on like this
putting everything at risk

[Chorus:]
Hard to live with the shadow side of me
You need what I can't be
Holding on to an image of a man
If you're looking for perfection
that is not the way I am

You say that you love me
but a future is too hard to promise
It's making no sense to my head

I know there's a dark side of my spirit
where you just can't find me
There is not a saint in here
just a tarnished soul who cares

[Chorus:]
Hard to live with the shadow side of me
You need what I can't be
Holding on to an image of a man
If you're looking for perfection
that is not the way I am

It all started all right
making love in the twilight
Is any man what a girl dreams
Is any girl forever
exactly what she seems
