Lyrics:


The year is ending
I feel the fall just fade away
As I think of the new friends in my life
And the ones who could not stay
You take my hand now
Oh, how your smile just warms my heart
The chill in the air, I don't mind at all
That's how easy love should start

All over the world, we're waiting
For the joy that the season brings
Every heartbeat happy
And in love, our voices sing

Such busy lives now
And though we yearn for simple things
Our friends and our families all around
That's the best this life can bring

All over the world, we're waiting
For the joy that the season brings
Every heartbeat happy
And in love, our voices sing
Yes, in love, our voices sing

Maybe December
Helps us remember
What we are grateful for
The new year is close now
Let's show all the world how
To love just a little more

All over the world, we're waiting
For the joy that the season brings
Every heartbeat happy
And in peace, our voices sing
Peace and love, our voices sing
Peace and love, our voices sing
Peace and love, our voices sing
