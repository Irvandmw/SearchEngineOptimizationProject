Lyrics:


Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send

Beauty I'd always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore

Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you

Gazin at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I'm goin through
They can't understand

Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you

Some try to tell me
Thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be
You will be in the end

Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you
