Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The mixture between,
The fantastic dream,
And the fear,
You wonder where she is,
This afternoon.

And does it get on your nerves,
Make you slightly perturbed,
That there's things that you don't know about her?
And even the places that she's never been with yer,
seem awful empty without her.

You can't look into those eyes,
Down no telephone line,
What if you were right first time? [x2]

The mixture between,
The fantastic dream,
And the fear,
You wonder where she is,
This afternoon.

You can't look into those eyes,
Down no telephone line,
What if you were right first time?
