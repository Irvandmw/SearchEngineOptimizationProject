Lyrics:


You shine like the brightest star in all of the sky
Like a falling satellite and I'd fly around you
Just to see if you might touch down, circle around me
Circle around me

You make me wanna let the light in and fill up all the dark
You make me wanna keep on fightin' when everything falls apart
You've got a way of making everything okay
Even though I can't erase the pain, I'm no longer afraid
You let the light in

Your rain, weather in a storm to look in
Your face, like walkin' through a door and into outer space
Nothin' in this world could ever take your place
Now that I found you, now that I found you

You make me wanna let the light in and fill up all the dark
You make me wanna keep on fightin' when everything falls apart
You've got a way of making everything okay
Even though I can't erase the pain, you let the light in

You shine like the brightest star in all of the sky
Like a falling satellite and I'd fly around you
Just to see if you might touch down
