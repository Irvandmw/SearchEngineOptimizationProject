Lyrics:


Drivin' around, I just can't hear a sound
'Cept my own wheels turnin'
Wastin' a day, I'm just runnin' away
From a heart that's burnin' but I can't run forever

Yes, we're gonna fall in love and it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love, it's gonna be tonight
I can just imagine, huggin' and teasin'
And lovin' and squeezin' all night

I've made up my mind this is gonna be mine
I'm so glad I waited
Why did I try to figure out why
Everything can't be anticipated, I can't wait to tell him

Yes, we're gonna fall in love and it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love, it's gonna be tonight
I can just imagine, huggin' and teasin'
And lovin' and squeezin' all night, oh yes

Oh yeah, teasin' and lovin' and squeezin' all night
Ooh yeah, I can just imagine, huggin' and teasin'
And lovin' and squeezin' all night

Oh yes, we're gonna fall in love and it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love, it's gonna be tonight
Yes, we're gonna fall in love and it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love, it's gonna be tonight

Yes, we're gonna fall in love and it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love, it's gonna be tonight
Yes, we're gonna fall in love and it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love, it's gonna be tonight
