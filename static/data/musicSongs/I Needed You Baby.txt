Lyrics:


You don't know the changes 
You put me through 
Always strong to show me the wrong
You laughed at me so long 
And many times 
I fought for your brother man 
And what you were tryna do I wanna know 
From you to me, I could see right through you 
You were just another dude

Ooh when I needed you (I needed you baby) 
Ooh I needed you (I needed you baby) 
Ooh...

So depressed I must confess 
I nearly felt misused 
Love ain't never left me in such a mess 
I found myself confused 
Well, we battled so long
We were really at it strong 
Just left everything in the world 
Another time we can't get along baby 
I'm just a lonely girl

Oh when I needed you! (I needed you baby) 
Hey! When I wanna need you (I needed you baby) 
Needed you needed you needed you (I needed you baby) 
Ooh I needed you baby (I needed you baby) 
Hey...

They was a real real love
It is true! 
Yes, it is! 
Always a, a big thing going on, baby! 
Me and you! Yeah! Yeah yeah! 
You quit trying 
And you know what? 
Love come dying

(And I needed) And I needed 
(And I needed) And I needed 
(And I needed) And I cried baby 
(And I needed) And I needed 
(And I needed) And I loved you baby 
(And I needed) Oh I needed 
(And I needed) Yeah

And I needed you surely 
I needed you baby 
I have to say it say it say it

All the time I couldn't find my mind 
My love for you so crazy 
Ooh darlin' 
What's the use 
To tell you the truth 
I knew you would always betray me 
Yes I did 
Many times I fought for your brother man 
And what you were tryna do 
From you to me, I could see right through you 
You were just another dude

Oh I needed you 
(I need you baby) 
Oh I needed you 
(I needed you baby) 
Needed you needed you needed you 
(I needed you baby) 
Oh I needed you baby 
(I needed you baby)
