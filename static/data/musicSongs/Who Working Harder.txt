Lyrics:


I started off in the streets (That's how it started)
Now I put my heart on the beat (That's what I do)
I'm never fallin' asleep (No no no no)
I don't need molly, I'm geeked (I don't need the molly)
Tell me who workin' harder than me? (Who workin' harder?)
Who workin' harder than me? (Who workin' harder?)
Tell me who workin' harder than me? (Who workin' harder?)
Who workin' harder than me?

I had to get off my ass and quit playin' and go get the money
I don't entertain what these niggas sayin', I keep it a hundred
Talkin' to God when I pray in the mornin', I tell him I want it
Tellin' my momma to pray for her baby, I'm runnin' from karma
I had to start livin' right so I switched up my life and I picked up a mic
I'm feelin' picky tonight, I feel like I could hit any bitch that I like
But I gotta give all my love to the music, I can't even do it
And God is the reason I'm in this position, don't ever confuse it

I started off in the streets (That's how it started)
Now I put my heart on the beat (That's what I do)
I'm never fallin' asleep (No no no no)
I don't need molly, I'm geeked (I don't need the molly)
Tell me who workin' harder than me? (Who workin' harder?)
Who workin' harder than me? (Who workin' harder?)
Tell me who workin' harder than me? (Who workin' harder?)
Who workin' harder than me?

I had to get on one knee, bow my head and ask God for forgiveness
All of the shit that a young nigga did to get in this position
I got that pack on the way and I'm sellin' it all in the trenches
Remember back in the day I was starvin', I ain't have a penny
But it ain't get the best of me
I had to get out and go learn the recipe
I gotta keep all my real niggas next to me
We workin' hard every day like some Mexicans
I played the cards I was dealt, ain't no pressure
I gather my thoughts and arrange them collectively
Me and my niggas, we did it together
If you don't work hard then I don't want you next to me, hey

I started off in the streets (That's how it started)
Now I put my heart on the beat (That's what I do)
I'm never fallin' asleep (No no no no)
I don't need molly, I'm geeked (I don't need the molly)
Tell me who workin' harder than me? (Who workin' harder?)
Who workin' harder than me? (Who workin' harder?)
Tell me who workin' harder than me? (Who workin' harder?)
Who workin' harder than me? (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
