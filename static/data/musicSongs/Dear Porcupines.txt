Lyrics:


Drown me in my daily cup of tea
Tell the porcupines to quit stabbing me
They make me fall, but I will stand
'Cause all of them are jerks with their cups in their hands

Now they want a whisper, a whisper from me
'Cause all of them have watched me on their big-screen TVs
But what about little old, little old me
The one who got bullied because of her teeth

I hope you all are watching my middle finger rise
To the bullies in the school yard. I know I'm on your mind
Now you say you love me, but what about before
When I was just that silly little girl next door

Ladies, oh, ladies, why are you so mad?
Is it 'cause I'm classy, and you're a trash bag?
Your teasing and laughing resonates through my heart
And now you're calling me 'cause you want a fresh start

Now look at you, boys, you can't believe your eyes
You told me I was ugly and I took you by surprise
You should've been nicer 'cause look where I'm at
While you copy Mac Miller wearin' snap back hats

I hope you all are watching my middle finger rise
To the bullies in the school yard. I know I'm on your mind
Now you say you love me, but what about before
When I was just that silly little girl next door

Why would you be so mean talking trash about me?

All I wanted was a friend to laugh and cry and spend all of the eternity
Or even just a week

I hope you all are watching my middle finger rise
To the bullies in the school yard. I know I'm on your mind
Now you say you love me, but what about before
When I was just that silly little girl next door
