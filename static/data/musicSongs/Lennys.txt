Lyrics:


Either you got the gown, or many in your posse
Excuse me but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
Either you got the gown, and yes I'd like to watch her
Oh won't you please give me a break,

oh won't you please leave me alone?

My yamo wants the gabo and I'm a bore
Your glasses are so freakin high, your food

I can afford to buy, I'm going to Lenny's..

I'm going to Lenny's... Or is it Denny's?

You got a problem with me?
I got it turning in my body
Excuse me ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
And yes I'm wearing a gown, I'm just trying to please
Oh won't you give me a break,

oh won't you please leave me alone?

My yamo wants the gabo and I'm a bore
Your glasses are so freakin high,

your food I can afford to buy, I'm going to Lenny's..

I'm going to Lenny's... Or is it Denny's?

Either you got the gown, or many in your posse
Excuse me but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
Either you got the gown, and yes I'd like to watch her
Oh won't you please give me a break,

oh won't you please leave me alone?

My yamo wants the gabo and I'm a bore
Your glasses are so freakin high,

your food I can afford to buy, I'm going to Lenny's..

Just because I don't like Yetzi doesn't mean that I'm a dopehead
Maybe I'm ducking for cover, but I am real sucka
Maybe if you let me die, you are not exactly right
But if you were left to me, you would be so fucking scared

You wouldn't be so stinking stiff there lady...
If ya just let me sit down... and have a Coke... or something...

My yamo wants the gabo and I'm a bore
Your glasses are so freakin high,

your food I can afford to buy, I'm going to Lenny's..
