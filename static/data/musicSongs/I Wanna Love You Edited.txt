Lyrics:


[Akon:]
Convict Music, and you know we up front.

I see you winding and grinding up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

[Snoop Dogg:]
Money in the air as more feel
Grab you by your coattail
Take you to the motel, hoe sale,
Don't tell, won't tell,
Baby say I don't talk Dogg
Unless you told on me, oh well,
Take a picture with me,
What the flick gon' do,
Baby stick to me
And I'mma stick on you,
If you pick me
Then I'mma pick on you,
D-O-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you,
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right,
Rip riding the poles and them doors is tight
And I'mma get me a shot for the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and baby you're pussy for life.

[Akon:]
I see you winding and grinding up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

Shorty I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese,
See you looking at me now
What is gon' be
Just another tease far as I can see,
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs,
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that
'Cause I'm far from a scrub,
You know my pedigree,
Ex-dealer use to move amphetamines,
Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides I got a thing for you.

I see you winding and grinding up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know, girl

[Snoop Dogg:]
Mobbin' through the club in low pressing
I'm sitting in the back in the smokers section
(just smoking),
Bird's eye, I got a clear view,
You can't see me but I can see you
(baby I see you),
It's cool we jet the mood is set,
Your pussy is wet
You're rubbing your back and touching your neck,
Your body is movin' you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' you smilin' and grinnin' and looking at me.

[Akon:]
Girl and while you're looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy,
Baby you got a phatty
The type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything
And that's kinda scary,
'Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass,
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass,
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you.

[2x]
I see you winding and grinding up on the floor,
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know, girl
