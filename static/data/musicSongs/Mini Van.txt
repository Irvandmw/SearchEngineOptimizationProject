[BlocBoy JB:]
I get them hitters in Mini Van
Chopper it spinning, no ceiling fan
Get your bitches then I ball like a skeleton
Call up the plug and I told him quit meddling
I ain't got no time for no middleman
Walk in the trap and take over his trap, should I let him in?
If I do then we gon make a settlement
These niggas snitching, they talk too intelligent
I know that these niggas telling it
I can't believe that they (Ayy)
I can't believe that they (Ayy)

Fuck nigga dissin' it's BOA
I need a check like it's BOA
I got them chips like it's Frito-Lay
So much cheese, let's have a Dorito race
I just brought so many guns through the TSA
Don't tell me, "Sir, can you open your briefcase?"
Your money is slow, that's a delay
You only been trappin' and serving for 3 days
I bring the back to the front like a replay
I shoot my gun and it turn to relay
I'ma turn up for a month on my C-Day
Me and Lil Cameron gon turn up for his P-Day
I just caught me a lil' opp on the e-way
I hit heat him up 'til he cremate

I get them hitters in Mini Van
Chopper it spinning, no ceiling fan
Get your bitches then I ball like a skeleton
Call up the plug and I told him quit meddling
I ain't got no time for no middleman
Walk in the trap and take over his trap, should I let him in?
If I do then we gon make a settlement
These niggas snitching, they talk too intelligent
I know that these niggas telling it

[DaBaby:]
Ah, your partners' gon' tell they bitches (Uh-huh)
The phones out with me doing business (Brrrt)
The poles with me doing pictures (Yeah)
R&B hoes in my mentions (Huh?)
You paid for the hoe, I didn't (No)
She went and bought a four-five pistol (She do)
Brought it back in the box, no Christmas (Yeah)
Just think about me and your bitch, running round in your shit, playing hide and go get it (Haha)
Got my hand on the back of her head, with her face in the bed, looking dead at your picture (Yeah-Yeah-Yeah)
Giving your lil' bitch dick and she like it (Yeah)
It's a quickie, don't kick off my Nike's (Uh-huh)
Sucking dick in your kitchen, she triflin' (Uh)
Slide the door open and this nigga tried me (Watch out)
