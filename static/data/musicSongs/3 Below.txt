Lyrics:


I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 Below zero, Below
Saint Laurent and quarter water
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter
Cause I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 Below zero, Below

Gucci slippers girl you poppin, ya know
The way you look I know you got them niggas flocking
And you got them Rihanna dreads
Now you deserve a nigga with a Kawasaki, ouu

Saint Laurent and quarter water, ya know
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter, oh
I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 Below zero, Below

You know I like them ratchet bitches, ya know
You know I tell her suck it 'fore she ask permission, oh
You know I make em 'all audition, oh
Four naked bitches this is new edition, oh
I was out here riding round, ya know
I was only jugging on my part of town, oh
I'm gon need you quiet now, oh
Know you see me balling don't go out of bounds, oh

Saint Laurent and quarter water
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter
Cause I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 Below zero, Below

Girl you got a bright future, ouu
Damn you look nice girl the lights suit ya
I prefer you naked
If your head's good you'll make a nice tutor
I don't mean no disrespect, no
But I prefer Shaniqua over Lizabeth
Me I like them ratchet bitches, oh
Only hit her once a year that's after Christmas, yeah

Saint Laurent and quarter water, ya know
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter, oh
Cause I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 Below zero, Below

Ooh oh [x3]
3 Below Zero, ya know

Ooh oh [x3]
3 Below Zero, ya know
