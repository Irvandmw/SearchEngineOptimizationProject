Lyrics:


[Roddy Ricch:]
My diamonds shine like the stars
And that's why a young nigga came through flexin'
Double Gs on me and my patek luminescent, yeah
Buss down the Cartiers and got a new necklace
Pull up in the drop, got us in a new message
I wanna get rich and put a milli on my wrist
Lately I been driving, prolly riding with the stick
If you came from the bottom then you know how it is
I came from the struggle so I know how it is

I ain't gotta do no cap
Riding in the back of the Bach
Can't do no relaxing, all I do is trap
'Cause I want a new AP, yeah
Diamonds looking like HD, yeah
Young nigga had to get it on my own and it made me, yeah
Hoppin' out the Jet they know that all my diamonds wet, yeah
I want a milli, I can't ever settle for less, no
Got a lot of cash on me so I gotta ride with the TEC, yeah
Got it out the mud and I'm ballin' like the Nets, yeah
I'm the youngest, richest nigga in the set, yeah
Call me 21 Savage, I just shitted on my ex, yeah
I was tryna get rich off the pyrex
Came straight up out the yacht, yeah

My diamonds shine like the stars
And that's why a young nigga came through flexin'
Double Gs on me and my patek luminescent, yeah
Buss down the Cartiers and got a new necklace
Pull up in the drop, got us in a new message
I wanna get rich and put a milli on my wrist
Lately I been driving, prolly riding with the stick
If you came from the bottom then you know how it is
I came from the struggle so I know how it is

[Chip:]
Yeah
Take the money, clean the muddy, just depends on my mood (ayy)
Yeah I work and pay my tax, got muddy cash on me too (Chippy)
Plug talk out in Cali, now I'm shipping that food (ayy)
Nigga, I don't mean no P notes, 50 pounds in the room (Ganja)
Young and getting it, ain't selling mine or trusting a soul, yeah
Gangster films had taught me keep your eyes on your bros, yeah
Niggas talkin' crazy, dawg, I thought we was woes, yeah
Enemies ain't always far, nah they can be close, yeah
Boy, rapping ain't dead but your rhymes is
Trapping ain't dead but your line is
Never get the cake or the icing
Older seen a young nigga shining
Can't build a line, wanna line him
So we gon' pull up in diamonds

[Roddy Ricch:]
My diamonds shine like the stars
And that's why a young nigga came through flexin'
Double Gs on me and my patek luminescent, yeah
Buss down the Cartiers and got a new necklace
Pull up in the drop, got us in a new message
I wanna get rich and put a milli on my wrist
Lately I been driving, prolly riding with the stick
If you came from the bottom then you know how it is
I came from the struggle so I know how it is

[Yxng Bane:]
Diamonds shining, mummy thinks that I'm a star
Broski, don't you turn on me, we come this far
Put a bustdown on my wrist, I pull her hair, I'm cumming fast
Put a bustdown on my kicks, cash in my jeans, grind extra hard
Big cash when I spill, no cap
Big cheese, can't hang with rats
It's the life that she wan' snap
Big metal, we don't do no scrap
I still pray all my days that I see the next day
Where I'm from they die young, can't get rid of my name
Get rich, like Roddy, big drip, no Tommy
Jeans, Mike Amiri, got checks like Louis
Fell in love with a girl before she told me her name
I can't cry, I buy diamonds just to freeze all my pain

[Roddy Ricch (Yxng Bane):]
And that's why a young nigga came through flexin' (flexin')
Double Gs on me and my patek luminescent, yeah (luminescent, yeah)
Buss down the Cartiers and got a new necklace (new necklace, yeah)
Pull up in the drop, got us in a new message (skrrt, skrrt)
I wanna get rich and put a milli on my wrist (wrist, wrist, wrist)
Lately I been driving, prolly riding with the stick (yeah)
If you came from the bottom then you know how it is
I came from the struggle so I know how it is

[Yxng Bane:]
Know how it is
I came from the trenches so I know how it is, yeah
Know how it is
I came from the trenches so I know how it is
