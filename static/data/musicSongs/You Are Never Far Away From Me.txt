Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You are never far away from me, 
When we part I hold your memory! 
You linger in my dreams, 
When day has flown... 
And through the lonely night, 
I'm not alone! 

When two sweethearts care, as you and I, 

There's no sadness in the word, good-bye! 
Because you're always in my heart my love, 
Wherever I may be, 
You are never far away from me!
