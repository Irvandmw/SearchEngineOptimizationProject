Lyrics:


Oh, there's no boat like a rowboat 
for row, row romancin' love...  

Hearts will skip an' they'll miss  
as we kiss in the dark  
Oh what love we can make  
on a lake in the park 

It's an ocean of devotion  
a floating dream for two... 

Oh, I keep hopin' that  
the oars will stray  
so we could drift forever  
and a day! 

'Cause, there's no boat like a rowboat 
it's row, row rosy  
for row, row romance 
in a row, row, rowboat with you!  

(Don't wanna steam boat!) 
that's not my dreamboat  
(Don't wanna sail boat!) 
or a whale boat! 
(Don't wanna tug boat, a chug-a-lug boat!) 
or an ocean liner  
on it's way to China!  

Oh, there's no boat like a rowboat 
for row, row romancin' love...  

It's an ocean of devotion  
a floating dream for two... 

'Cause, there's no boat like a rowboat 
in a row, row rowboat with you!  

(l could skip an' they'll miss  
as we kiss in the dark) 
Oh what love we can make  
in the lake in the park 

(It's an ocean of devotion  
a floating dream for two...) 

Oh, I keep hoping that  
the oars will stray  
so we could drift forever  
and a day! 

'Cause, there's no boat like a rowboat 
it's row, row rosy  
for row, row romance 
in a row, row, rowboat with you!
