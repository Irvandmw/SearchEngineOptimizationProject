Lyrics:


Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1:]
Everyone is waitin' on the bell
A couple seconds, we'll be raisin' hell.
The sun is shinin' down, school is finally out.
Nothin' matters, so we might as well.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Everybody's bakin' in the sun,
Come and party, do it while we're young.
Move your body, when you hear the drum.
SO PUT YOUR HANDS UP!

[Chorus:]
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more.
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be, be a bitchin' summer.
Bitchin' summer
Bitchin' summer

[Verse 2:]
Throwin' empty bottles in the fire
Whiskey's got us singin' like a choir
We're all gonna run, when the police come.
But in the moment we are so alive.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Everybody's bakin' in the sun,
Come and party, do it while we're young.
Move your body, when you hear the drum.
SO PUT YOUR HANDS UP!

[Chorus:]
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more.
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer.
Oh, bitchin' summer
Bitchin' summer

[Bridge - rap:]
Right right right near the beach
The party don't stop
If we don't get harassed by the mother fuckin' cops
Quarter tank of gas
About a half a pack
My cellphone's dyin' but there's no turnin' back
I can feel the breeze
Steerin' with my knees
Drummin' on the dashboard
Bumpin' to the beat
Hit the windshield wipers
Searchin' for my lighter
I gotta get right before this all-nighter

[Chorus:]
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more.
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer.
Oh, bitchin' summer
Oh, bitchin' summer

Pick you up if you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more.
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer.
