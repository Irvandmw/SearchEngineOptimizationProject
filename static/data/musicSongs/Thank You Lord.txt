Lyrics:


Thank you Lord for lovin' me
For givin' me the chance so I could see
The love that you feel inside for me
You're everything I want you to be
And I thank you, my Lord

Thank you Lord for bein' there
You take me through life and you always care
I think about the times I needed you
You were always there to see me through
And I thank you, my Lord

I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, Lord

Thank you Lord you're my friend
You give me the strength to start over again
When life becomes hard, no ones seems to care
I reach out for you and you're always there
And I thank you my lord

Thank you Lord for lovin' me
For givin' me the chance so I could see
The love that you feel inside for me
You're everything I want you to be
And I thank you, my Lord

I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
When I'm feelin down and out
And I wonder what life is all about
And when you feel like cryin out
And there's no one left to cry about
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord
I want to thank you, my Lord...
