Lyrics:


Whatever you've got
I want some too
Whatever you're drinking
I'll drink with you
You're saying "azure"
I'm feeling blue
That's no lie

Whatever was done
Unto your hair
Vidal Sassoon
Was standing there
He fought the fascists
Keep him in your prayers
That's no lie

Whatever the time
Whatever the place
Whatever the rhyme
Whatever the reason
I'm giving offence
And with your defence
I think we could have
A very good season

Whatever the rights
I want the wrongs
Whatever the food
Let's hear the gong
We've spoken the truth
For so long
We need lies

Whatever the time
Whatever the place
Whatever the rhyme
Whatever the reason
I'm giving offence
And with your defence
I think we could have
A very good season

Whatever the rights
I want the wrongs
Whatever the food
Let's hear the gong
We've spoken the truth
For so long
We need lies

Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
Whatever you've got
