Lyrics:


Baby, it's you and me,
You see, we can turn the night up
And if you feel the way I feel
We can turn the night up

(gimme some of that)
(yeah)
(gimme some of that)
(gimme some of that)

Damn you look so sexy
Baby, you impress me
I wanna get nasty, ah, nasty
Girl you got the bom bom
Take a shot, you want one
Mama I can change your life (woo)

(gimme some of that)

The way you do it (woo)
You got that something (woo)
You got that something (woo)
So keep it moving, (woo)
You know I love it (woo)
You know I love it (woo)

Baby, it's you and me,
You see, we can turn the night up
And if you feel the way I feel
We can turn the night up

(gimme some of that)
(yeah)
(gimme some of that)

Girl, your body's effing
You know my intentions,
I know you can go all night, go all night
I just wanna touch you,
Girl just let me touch you
I know it's been on your mind
Hey!

(gimme some of that)

The way you do it (woo)
You got that something (woo)
You got that something (woo)
So keep it moving (woo)
You know I love it (woo)
You know I love it (woo)

(gimme some of that)

One love, one love

From Madrid to Miami
From Miami to the world

Baby, it's you and me,
You see, we can turn the night up
And if you feel the way I feel
We can turn the night up

Baby, it's you and me,
You see, we can turn the night up (turn it up)
And if you feel the way I feel
We can turn the night up

(gimme some of that)
(yeah)
(gimme some of that)
(gimme some of that)
