Lyrics:


Standing now in the mirror that I built myself
And I can't remember why the decision wasn't mine
But it seems I'm only clinging to an idea now
Took my heart and sold it out
To a vision that I wrote myself
And I don't want to be somebody in America
Just fighting the hysteria
I only wanna die some days
Someday, someday

When I burst into flames
I'll leave you the dust, my love
Hope a bit of it will be enough
To help remember the days
When we came to this place
I told you I'd spill my guts
I left you to clean it up
I'm bursting out of the...

Seems like now it's impossible to work this out
I'm so committed to an old ghost town
Is it really that strange if I always wanna change?
And if only the time and space between us wasn't lonely
I'd disintegrate into a thousand pieces
I think I'm making a mistake
But if I decide to break, who will fill the empty space?

So now if I figure this out
Apart from my beating heart
It's a muscle but it's still not strong enough
To carry the weight of the choices I've made
I told you I'd ride this out
It's getting harder every day somehow
I'm bursting out of myself

[Halsey & Kate Winslet:]
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or
I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive
I'm just a fucked up girl who's lookin' for my own piece of mind
Don't assign me yours
