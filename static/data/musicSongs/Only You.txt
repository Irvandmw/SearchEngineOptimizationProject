Lyrics:


Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me.
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving further away
Want you near me.

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
All I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of your name
And it's only a game
And I need you
Listening to the words that you say
Getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
All I ever knew
Only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

[Repeat x2]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
All I ever knew
Only you

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me.
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving further away
Want you near me.

[Repeat x2]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
All I ever knew
Only you
