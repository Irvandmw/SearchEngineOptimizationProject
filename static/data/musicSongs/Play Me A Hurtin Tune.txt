Lyrics:


Play me a hurtin' tune 
I wanna an old time hurtin' tune 
Make me sigh, make me cry 
Make me wanna lay down an' die! 

Oh! Play me a hurtin' tune 
A tear your heart out hurtin' tune 
Of a true, sweetheart who  
lost her lover an' feels so blue 

I love those "How could you be so cruel,  
treatin' me like a fool?" songs! 
I love those "Now that I know we're thru,  
what am I gonna do?" songs! 

Please! Play me a hurtin' tune 
I wanna an old time hurtin' tune 
Make me sad an' I'll be glad 
'Cause I feel so good when I feel so bad! 

(We love to feel so sad, we love to feel so bad, 
go on an' beat me, mistreat me, go ahead an' cheat me,  
I like it, I like it, we like it!) 

Ah! Make me sigh (make me cry!) 

Make me wanna lay down an' die! 

A tear your heart out hurtin' tune 
Of a true, sweetheart who  
lost her lover an' feels so blue 

I love those... ("How could you be so cruel,  
treat me like a fool?" songs!) 
I love those... ("Now that I know we're thru,  
what am I gonna do?" songs!) 

Please! Play me a hurtin' tune 
I wanna an old time hurtin' tune 
Make me sad an' I'll be glad 
'Cause I feel so good when I feel so bad! 

Oh look it girls, he's playin' our song! 
Play us a hurtin' tune 
We wanna an old time hurtin' tune 
Make us sad, we'll be glad 
'Cause we feel so good when we feel so sad!
