Lyrics:


Uh, what, Stars, Stars
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me

Youâre so easy to love
You make me cuckoo like a turtle dove
So hot that I canât get enough
Enough of you

Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry

(Sing it to me, babe)

âCause youâre the beautiful player
Youâre a beautiful player, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ah-ah-ahâ¦

(Sing it to me, doll)

Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a truck top backrub time of our lives
He's selling stars on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens

We're feeling like we wanna die fast
âCause heâs been breaking the law and heâs not going back
I love him violently all through the night
And yes itâs true, I live for you

(Sing it to me, babe)

âCause youâre my beautiful player
Youâre my beautiful player, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-yeahâ¦

L is for your love that you gave and took away
O is for the only want I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the X that we took with champagne

Hit me and it felt like a kiss, baby
If it donât hurt then Iâll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true loveâs law and he canât give

(Sing it to me, babe)

âCause heâs my beautiful player
Heâs my beautiful player, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-yeahâ¦
