Lyrics:


For all the times that you've rained on my parade.
And all the clubs you get in using my name. 
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake. 
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't.

And I didn't wanna write a song.
Cause I didn't want everyone thinking I still care.
I don't but you still hit my phone up.
and baby, I'll be moving on 
and I think you should be something I don't wanna hold back, 
Baby you should know that

My momma don't like you,
and she likes everyone,
and I never like to admit that I was wrong.
But I've been so caught up in my job 
Didn't see what's going on,
and now I know,
I'm better sleeping on my own.

Cause if you like the way you look that much,
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself,
and if you think that I'm still holding on,
There's something, you should go and fuck yourself. 

And when you told me that you hated my friends,
The only problem was with you and not them.
and when you tried to tell me my opinion was wrong,
and tried to make me forget where I came from.

And I didn't wanna write a song.
Cause I didn't want everyone thinking I still care.
I don't but you still hit my phone up.
And baby, I'll be moving on 
and I think you should be something I don't wanna hold back, 
Baby you should know that

My momma don't like you,
and she likes everyone,
and I never like to admit that I was wrong.
But I've been so caught up in my job 
Didn't see what's going on,
and now I know,
I'm better sleeping on my own.

Cause if you like the way you look that much,
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself,
and if you think that I'm still holding on,
There's something, you should go and fuck yourself. 

For all the times that you made me feel small,
I fell in love now I feel nothing at all. 
I've never felt so low, when I was vulnerable,
Was I a fool to let you break down these walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much,
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself,
and if you think that I'm still holding on,
There's something, you should go and fuck yourself. 
[x3]

Cause if you like the way you look that much,
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself.
