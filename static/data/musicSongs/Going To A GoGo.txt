Lyrics:


Goin' to a go go
Goin' to a go go
Na na na na, yeah

Well, there's a brand new place I've found
Where people go from miles around
They come from everywhere
And if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town

Goin' to a go go, everybody's
Goin' to a go go, well, come on now
Don't you want to go, yeah

One more time, yeah I'm
Goin' to a go go, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Goin' to a go go, baby come on now

It doesn't matter where you are
A go go can be far
You'll see the people from your block
And don't be shocked
If you see your favorite star

Goin' to a go go, 'cause everybody's
Goin' to a go go, aw come on now
Don't you want to go, yeah, people come on

Na na na na yeah, ooh tell me
Don't you want to go, yeah
Now it's alright, I-yi
Goin' to a go go, yes I am now
Goin' to a go go, oh come on now

It doesn't matter if you don't stagger
It doesn't matter if you don't drag
You should have some fun
I'm telling everyone
Most every taxi that you flag is

Goin' to a go go, oh come on baby
Goin' to a go go, baby come on now
Don't you want to go, yeah
One more time, yeah

I'm goin' to a go go
Goin' to a go go, baby come on now
Goin' to a go go, oh come on baby
Goin' to a go go, oh come on now
Goin' to a go go
