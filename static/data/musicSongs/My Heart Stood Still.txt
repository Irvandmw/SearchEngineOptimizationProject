Lyrics:


I took one look at you, that's all I meant to do 
And then my heart stood still 
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move an' talk 
And then my heart stood still 

Though not a single word was spoken  
I could tell you knew  
That unfelt clasp of hands,  
told me so well you knew 
I never lived at all,  
until the thrill of that moment  
when my heart stood still! 

Though not a single word was spoken  
I could tell you knew  
That unfelt clasp of hands,  
told me so well you knew 
I never lived at all,  
until the thrill of that moment  
when my heart stood still!
