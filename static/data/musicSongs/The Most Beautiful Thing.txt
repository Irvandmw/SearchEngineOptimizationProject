Lyrics:


Everybodyâs coming out
Glittering and screaming so loud
I just want to walk down your road
I just want to dance slow

Of all Iâve known
All Iâve seen
Youâre The Most Beautiful Thing

Everyone is looking for it
Searching until they are hurting for it
Stop looking in the mirror
Weâve got just what we came with

Of all Iâve known
All Iâve seen
Youâre The Most Beautiful Thing

And I want you to sing for us
I want you to sing for us
Need you to sing for us

Everything I know feels alright
I wonât search no more tonight

Of all Iâve known
All Iâve seen
All I dream
Youâre The Most Beautiful Thing
