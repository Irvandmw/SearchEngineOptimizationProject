Lyrics:


I didn't plan to fall in love with you it just happened that way
And all the time inside my heart I knew that I'd regret it some day
Now I can't stand to be away from you but I'm alone every day
I didn't plan to fall in love with you it just happened that way

I saw you and I loved you why I I'll never know
There wasn't one chance in a million that our love would grow
You were too far above me any fool could plainly see
But like driftwood on the river I floated on helplessly

I didn't plan to fall in love with you...
