Lyrics:


Winter has me in it's grip
think I'll take a summer trip
on a sunny sailing ship
where the shells lie in the sand

I feel so lonely
I'm to young to feel this old
I need you and you only
when the weather gets this cold. That's why

Winter has me in it's grip
think I'll take a summer trip
on a sunny sailing ship
where the shells lie in the sand

There's no use in going
cause it's cold inside my heart
and it's always snowing
since the day we broke apart.

Winter has me in it's grip
think I'll take a summer trip
on a sunny sailing ship
where the shells lie in the sand.

I tried to run from winter
like this spring and summer run to fall
But when the weather's in you
there's no hiding place at all, that's why

Winter has me in it's grip
think I'll take a summer trip
on a sunny sailing ship
where the shells lie in the sand.
