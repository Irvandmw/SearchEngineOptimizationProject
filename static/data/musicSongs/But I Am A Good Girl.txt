Lyrics:


The dress is Chanel, the shoes YSL
The bag is Dior, Agent Provocateaur
My address today, L.A. by the way
Above Sunset Strip, the Hills all the way

My rings are by Webster, it makes their heads twirl
They all say, "Darling, what did you do for those pearls?"
What?! I am a good girl

B.H. I adore, Rodeo l'amore
Breakfast Polo Lounge, then poolside for sure
The Chateau for cocktails, the Courtyard at nine
Dan Tana's for dinner, The Helen's divine

You know I have found the word's gone around
They all say my feet never do touch the ground
What?! I am a good girl

I am a good girl
