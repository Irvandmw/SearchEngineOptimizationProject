Lyrics:


Softly they fall, where do they go?
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Gentle snowflakes)
Fall from the sky, before your eyes
(It's so thrilling)
Blankets of white, brighten the night
(Such a feeling)
They seem to say, that our love is here to stay
We'll be cozy and warm until summer flowers bloom

Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(Chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(Tootsies toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Love the snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the gloom
I will always remember this night here with you

Yeah, snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
Snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes

Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(Chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(Tempters toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Love the snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the gloom
I will always remember this night here with you

Yeah, I say, snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
Snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes...
Snowflakes are falling, falling...
And I got you in my arms...
