Lyrics:


Well it's all I can do to keep my hands off of you, but I'm tryin'
Pretty lady I know that your love could be so satisfyin'
You're a fine lookin' woman and you rock my soul
I'm afraid I'm gonna loose control
You know I wanna treat you right
And I don't wanna be lonely tonight

Well I know you can tell I'm gettin' hooked on your spell that I'm under
Flyin' up on a cloud with my heart beatin' loud as the thunder
But you're torturing me with everything you say
Then you go and turn your love away
You know I wanna treat you right
And I don't wanna be lonely tonight

Lightin' is flashing and everything's crashin' around in my brain
The moon in the sky's shinin' deep in your eyes nearly drives me insane
Girl I can't make it without you
I love everything about you
Keepin' me waiting is causing me so much pain

Lightin' is flashing and everything's crashin' around in my brain
The moon in the sky's shinin' deep in your eyes nearly drives me insane
Girl I can't make it without you
I love everything about you
Keepin' me waiting is causing me so much pain

Well, you're torturin' me and you can already see my reaction
If our lips ever touch it's gonna give me so much satisfaction
You're a fine lookin' woman, won't you be so kind
Come over here before I loose my mind
You know I wanna treat you right
And I don't wanna be lonely tonight

Well you know I'm gonna treat you right
And I don't wanna be lonely tonight
