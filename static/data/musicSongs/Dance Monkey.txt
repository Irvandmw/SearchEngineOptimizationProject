Lyrics:


I was in the wild
Living life from tree to tree
So I learned a simple song
And sang in a jamboree

And the people came and cheered
Thought that I was finally free
Till they sold me to a man
That had another plan for me

He said dance monkey, dance
(Dance monkey)
Play that song I know, oh, oh
He said dance monkey, dance
(Dance monkey)
In this yellow coat

Dance, dance, dance monkey
Dance, dance, dance monkey
Dance, dance, dance monkey

Saved up just enough
To buy a new guitar
And I wrote a simple song
An honest message from my hear

When I sang it to the crowd
It was not the same applause
I could hear them screaming out
You know what we came here for

They said dance monkey, dance
(Dance monkey)
Play that song I know, oh, oh
They said dance monkey, dance
(Dance monkey)
In your flower coat

Dance, dance, dance monkey
Dance, dance, dance monkey

It doesn't matter what the people say
You can take my house way
Cause I know that I'll never be no
Dance, dance, dance monkey
It doesn't matter what the people say
You can take my house way
Cause I know that I'll never be no
Dance, dance, dance monkey
