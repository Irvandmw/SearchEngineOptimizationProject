Lyrics:


If wishes were kisses, I'd still be kissing you 
I'd hold you in my arms again the way I used to do 
If wishes were kisses, how happy I would be 
I'd always have you close to me to thrill me through an' through 
If dreamers were schemers, I'd make my dream come true 
If wishes were kisses, I'd still be kissing you! 

If wishes were kisses, how happy I would be! 
I'd always have you close to me to thrill me through an' through 
If dreamers were schemers, I'd make my dream come true 
If wishes were kisses, I'd still be kissing you!
