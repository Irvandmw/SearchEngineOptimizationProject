Lyrics:


He was morning, and I was night time
I one day woke up
To find him lying beside my bed
So I softly said "Come take me"
For I've been lonely in need of someone
As though I'd done someone wrong somewhere
But I don't know where, I don't know where
Come lately

You are the sun, I am the moon
You are the words, I am the tune
Play me

Song he sang to me
Song he brang to me
Words that rang in me,
Rhyme that sprang in me
Warmed the night, and what was right
Became me

You are the sun, I am the moon
You are the words, I am the tune
Play me

And so it was that I came to travel
Upon a road that is thorned and narrow
Another place, another grace
Would save me

You are the sun, I am the moon
You are the words, I am the tune
Play me
You are the sun, I am the moon
You are the words, I am the tune
Play me, play me
