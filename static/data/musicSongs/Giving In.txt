Giving in cause I love you
Take my love, take it all
Put your trust in this cause

'Cause I will love you baby

I'm giving everything I own
Take it all honey
Take me home
Giving when I can
I ain't holding back
I want be the girl to give you this and that

I will love you 
(Yeah, I really love you baby)
(Yeah, yeah, I really love you)

Take as much of my love, boy
To your heart's delight
I'll give it to you nice, day and night
Give you what I think
You never really had
'Cause this here girl's love is truly bad

And I will love you baby

Very lovely, very fine
It's like paradise
So what else can I do
I'm giving in 
In to you

Giving in to you
Giving in 'cause I love you
You're so sweet

Got to give in once
It ain't no lie
I wanna do it with passion
Oh baby
Giving in, giving in to you
With all of my heart, 'cause I love you baby
Giving, giving in to you, giving in, 'cause I love you
Giving, giving in to you, giving into this, 'cause I love you
Giving in, ooh I love you baby
You're so sweet and you're so kind
Wish today you were all mine, boy
Giving in
You're the only, only boy in the world for me
Except for the other freaks
Yeah yeah yeah
