Lyrics:


Cupid, draw back your bow

New York
Tell me how you feel about it
We just met yeah
We just met

L.A.
Ask me for the truth about it
We just met
And I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands

How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows?
You're the one that I want
You're the one that I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high
Dancing really slow

How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows?
You're the one that I want
You're the one that I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high
Dancing really slow

Paris
Do you ever think about us
Watching TV in your bed
Hey London
Call me if you think about it
Don't forget
I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands

How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows?
You're the one that I want
You're the one that I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high
Dancing really slow

How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows?
You're the one that I want
You're the one that I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high
Dancing really slow

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart
For me
For me

How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows?
You're the one that I want
You're the one that I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high
Dancing really slow

How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows?
You're the one that I want
You're the one that I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high
Dancing really slow

I wish we could be holding hands
Dancing really high
Dancing really slow
Dancing really slow
