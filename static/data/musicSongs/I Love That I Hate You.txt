Lyrics:


Everything we use to do went wrong
Haven't shed one tear since you've been gone
I've got my pull out chair, football and beer
Ain't got one worry girl cause you ain't here
I've got my freedom back I'll do whatever I want
I guess this is how it's suppose to be
I can't believe it took this long for me to see

That I love that I hate you, I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you, haven't been so bad, it's the best time of the year
Cause I see you and I see him, you know I can't help but grin
And soon enough he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you 
I love that I hate you

Any other break up I'd be jealous
You can't hide behind the makeup girl you're selfish
You got another man following you around
Like a dog doing tricks to your every sound
I can't believe that use to be me and that use to be us

I love that I hate you, I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you, haven't been so bad, it's the best time of the year
Cause I see you and I see him, you know I can't help but grin
And soon enough he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you

Never thought that I could make it through, but I'm fine on my own with my middle finger salute

That I love that I hate you, I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you, haven't been so bad, it's the best time of the year
Cause I see you and I see him, you know I can't help but grin
And soon enough he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you 
I love that I hate you (I love that I hate you)
