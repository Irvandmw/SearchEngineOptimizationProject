Lyrics:


Someone really loves you guess who oh guess who
Someone really cares guess who
Open your heart surely then you'll see
That this someone who cares is me

Someone will wait eternally
Someone who wants your love desperately
Open up your heart surely then you'll see
That this someone who cares is me

(Someone really loves you) guess who oh guess who
(Someone really cares) guess who
Open up your heart surely then you'll see
That this someone who cares is me
(Someone someone)
