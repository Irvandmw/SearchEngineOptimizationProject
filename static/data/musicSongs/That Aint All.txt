Lyrics:


I'm gonna buy you a big hat with feathers an' plumes 
I'm gonna buy you a mansion with sixty thousand rooms 
An' that ain't all... no that ain't all! 

I'm gonna buy you powder, I'm gonna buy you paint 
Gonna fix you up an' make you look like somethin' you ain't 
An' that ain't all... no that ain't all! 

I'm gonna buy you a fur piece, I'm gonna buy you gloves 
I'll buy you anything if you will give me all of your love 
An' that ain't all (That ain't all!)  no that ain't all (That ain't all!) 

[instrumental break]

I'm gonna buy you a Rolls Royce, get you a chauffeur too 
But the chauffeur's gonna be a woman just like you 
An' that ain't all (That ain't all!)  no that ain't all (That ain't all!) 

I'm gonna buy you dresses, 'till your wardrobe falls 
You're gonna die of old age before you wear them all 
An' that ain't all (That ain't all!) that ain't all (That ain't all!) 

[instrumental break]

If we're both a livin' in nineteen ninety-five  
they will have a pill by then to keep us both alive 
An' that ain't all (That ain't all!)  that ain't all (That ain't all!) 

All these things I'll buy you, if you'll just wait for me  
'cause I'll be out of prison in nineteen eighty-three 
An' that is all (And that is all!)  that is all (And that is all!)  

That is all (And that is all!)  that is all!
