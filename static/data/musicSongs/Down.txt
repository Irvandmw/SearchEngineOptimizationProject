Lyrics:


I don't want to maintain, insane, get it up
You always play the blame game, no shame, had enough
I don't wanna maintain, insane, get it up
You always play the blame game, no shame, had enough

[VERSE 1]
Fresher,
Like it's the 1st semester
Rock it like Queen when I'm under pressure
While the rest of these cats, all siesta
Get loose like change when its on your dresser
BOOM
Here comes the real volume
Had enough to wake up and shake this tomb
I can act like skate decks in concrete rooms
We're about to face what makes this move

[Pre-Chorus]
People used to tell me that I'm on my own
They said I'd never make a difference on this microphone
'Cause there's a million other people who can sing this song
I said "Well, thanks for the push" 'cause you all were wrong

Let's Go

[Chorus]
You wanna try to take me under
I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder
You can't break me
You'll never take me down

[VERSE 2]
Explosion
Take it like rust corrosion
When it goes in GOOSH like you bust a nose in
Competitors
I was born to set it off
They wrapped me in cloth
I grabbed a mic and went on tour
Smash it
Back in school I was a hazard
Cause I never saw the glass,
Man, I just looked past it
Had a passion that burned like battery acid
Peter Parker, bit by some radioactive
(Shake this place in)

[Pre-Chorus]
People used to tell me that I'm on my own
They said I'd never make a difference on this microphone
'Cause there's a million other people who can sing this song
I said "Well, thanks for the push" 'cause you all were wrong

Let's Go

[Chorus]
You wanna try to take me under
I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder
You can't break me
You'll never take me down

[BRIDGE]
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
(Feel the movement, feel the pressure)
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
(Feel the movement, feel the pressure)
(Feel the movement, feel the pressure)

[Chorus]
You wanna try to take me under
I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder
You can't break me
You'll never take me down

You wanna try to take me under
I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder
You can't break me
You'll never take me down
