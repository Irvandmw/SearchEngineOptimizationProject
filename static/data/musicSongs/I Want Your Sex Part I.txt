Lyrics:


There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long, baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go?

I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you, but you still say "No"!

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long, baby
Out in the cold
But I can't take much more, girl,
I'm losing control

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex, sex

It's natural
It's chemical (let's do it)
It's logical
Habitual (can we do it?)
It's sensual
But most of all...
Sex is something we should do
Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural
Sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural 
Sex is fun
Sex is best when it's one on one
One on one

Sex
I'm not your father
Sex
I'm not your brother
Sex
Talk to your sister
Sex
I am a lover

C-c-c-c-come on

What's your definition of dirty, baby?
What do you consider pornography?
Don't you know I love you 'til it hurts me, baby?
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me?

What's your definition of dirty, baby?
What do you call pornography?
Don't you know I love you 'til it hurts me, baby?
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me?

Sex with me
Sex with me
Have sex with me

C-c-c-c-come on.
