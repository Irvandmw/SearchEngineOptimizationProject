Lyrics:


We are rolling, good

Little Jimmy just bought high top sneakers
Wants to fly high like his heroes can
Heâs got the smile like Michael Jordan
In the schoolyard, Jimmy, heâs the man

Iâm sitting here watching his heart beating
Heâs ten feet tall, all five feet four of him
Come six oâclock working out his foul shot
Who we fooling, Mamaâs calling, she smiles and says

You and me, weâre ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
These are extraordinary times

She lives alone, got four kids through high school
She cleans houses and she takes in wash at night
Youâd never know that she donât have much
Because sheâs rich with the things money canât buy

She donât need clothes, she donât want diamonds
Donât need a brand new car to drive in
What sheâs got is love and thatâs a lot
At least itâs a good start

You and me, weâre ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
These are extraordinary times

Everybody wants to be somebody
Everybody wants to be someone
We only want to watch the game on Sunday
Sit back, catch a little buzz

Ainât nobody wants to be nobody
Everybody wants a little love
Everybody wants to be the hero
And ride into the setting sun

You and me, weâre ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
These are extraordinary times

And Iâve got dreams like ordinary people
I can see them when I close my eyes at night
Canât you see weâre ordinary people
These are extraordinary times

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
