Lyrics:


[Siti:]
Forever-er

[Whitney:]
I know, I cannot leave this place for the memories
Things like the way they knew us all over town

Memories can hang you up and haunt you
All your life, you know
Guess so you cannot stay
And yet cannot go

[Siti:]
You are here for-e-ever
We stand together (ever)
Reaching beyond where there is sound
Farther than the eye can see
Forever... (ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever... (ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever

[Whitney:]
I've got to choose between tomorrow and yesterday
I can't stop to think about my life, here today

Memories can hang you up and haunt you
All your life, you know
Guess so you cannot stay
And yet cannot go

[Siti:]
You are here for-e-ever
We stand together (ever)
Reaching beyond where there is sound
Farther than the eye can see
Forever... (ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever... (ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever

[Whitney:]
I could find out where you've gone today
I feel so unhappy
Streets seem so empty now
I want you, I want you with me

Maybe I'll find someone to get you
Off my mind
Take me away from here
And leave it, leave it all behind

[Siti:]
Nippy you are here we last forever
Reaching beyond
Where there is light

Nippy I sing with you together
In my heart
Ohhhhh

[Whitney:]
Ohhhhhhh
Memories can hang you up
Memories (memories)... Memories (memories)
Memories
Can hang you up
Ohhhhhhh

[Siti:]
(Ever, ever, ever, ever)
Nippy I miss you... Oohhh
(Ever, ever, ever, ever)
Forever
