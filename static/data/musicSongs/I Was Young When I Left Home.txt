Lyrics:


I was young when I left home
But I been out a-ramblin' 'round
And I never wrote a letter to my home
To my home, Lord, to my home
And I never wrote a letter to my home

It was just the other day
I was bringing home my pay
When I met an old friend I used to know

Said your mother's dead and gone
Baby sister's all gone wrong
And your daddy needs you home right away

Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny on my name
Well, I can't go home thisaway
Thisaway, Lord, Lord, Lord
And I can't go home thisaway

If you miss the train I'm on
Count the days I'm gone
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, honey baby. Lord Lord Lord
And you'll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles

I'm playing on a track
Ma would come and whoop me back
On them trestles down by old Jim McKay's

When I pay the debt I owe
To the commissary store
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home
Go home, Lord Lord Lord
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home

Used to tell Ma sometimes
When I see them riding blinds
Gonna make me a home out in the wind
In the wind, Lord in the wind
Make me a home out in the wind

I don't like it in the wind
Wanna go back home again
But I can't go home thisaway
Thisaway, Lord Lord Lord
And I can't go home thisaway

I was young when I left home
And I been out rambling 'round
And I never wrote a letter to my home
To my home, Lord Lord Lord
And I never wrote a letter to my home
