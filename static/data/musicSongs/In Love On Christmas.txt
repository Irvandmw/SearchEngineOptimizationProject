Christmas time
Is so special
When youâre kissing me
Under the mistletoe
Exchanging love and gifts
Sitting in front of the tree
Me holding you
And you holding me

Weâll share
Iâve prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feelinâ
Weâll share
Iâve prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

Last year, Christmas
It happened without us
I was all mixed up and confused
I didnât know what to do, baby
I never thought Iâd feel this way
I always thought Christmas was a happy day
I always prayed that Santa'd pack love on a sleigh and send it my way

Weâll share
Iâve prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feelinâ
Weâll share
Iâve prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

What a beautiful time it is
A time to open gifts
And play with all the kids
Yes itâs Christmas
Yes itâs Christmas time again
Girl I love you
Yes I love you
Itâs Christmas time again
To be loved
On Christmas
Girl I love you baby
Yes I love you baby
What a beautiful time it is
A time to open gifts
Yes now itâs Christmas time
Now I am yours and you are mine
Oh when you kissing me
Right under my Christmas tree
Baby come close to me
âCause this is how it should be

Weâll share
Iâve prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feelinâ
Weâll share
Iâve prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas
