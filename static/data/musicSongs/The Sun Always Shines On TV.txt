Lyrics:


Touch me
How can it be?
Believe me
The sun always shines on T.V.
Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
And give all your love to me
To me

I reached inside myself but found 
Nothing there to ease the pressure 
Of my ever-worrying mind

All my powers waste away
I fear the crazed and lonely looks
The mirror's sending me these days

Touch me
How can it be?
Believe me
The sun always shines on T.V.
Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
And give all your love to me
To me

Please don't ask me to defend
The shameful lowlands of the way 
I'm drifting gloomily through time

(touch me)

I reached inside myself today
(give all your love)
Thinking there's got to be some way
To keep my troubles distant

Touch me
How can it be?
Believe me
The sun always shines on T.V.
Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
And give all your love to me

Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
Give all your love to me

To me
