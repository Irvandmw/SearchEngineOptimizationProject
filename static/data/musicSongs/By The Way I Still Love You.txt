Lyrics:


How are you
How you been
Funny seeing you again
I'm all right
Hope you are too
By the way, I still love you

Is he nice
Hm, that's fine
Yes she once was a friend of mine
But that's okay
It was my fault too
By the way, I still love you

Love you more than I can say love you more each day
Every breath I take
Every smile I fake
Every hour I'm awake

Well so long
Do come around
When you're in this part of town
Happy days
Good luck too
By the way, I still love you

Love you more than I can say love you more each day
Every breath I take
Every smile I fake
Every hour I'm awake

Well so long
Do come around
When you're in this part of town
Happy days
And good luck too
By the way, I still love you
