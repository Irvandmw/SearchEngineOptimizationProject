Lyrics:


Spring break, Bamboo Bill's, the sun was smolderin' hot
We looked like two lobsters that washed up
Huntin' a place to cool off
I slid my Red Stripe over, next to her Corona and lime
Buffet in the background, laughed until sundown
Danced until' closin' time

[Chorus]
Over two bottles of beer we watched the sun disappear
I knew I thought she was cool and could tell she dug me
I could go on 'bout that first kiss
But it really all started with
Two bottles of beer

Gulf breeze, Mississippi moon, a billion stars above
Half a mile down the beach, from that little tiki hut
Stopped in our tracks when we found out that
We both went to school at UT
Only catch was, she was from Texas, I was from Tennessee

[Repeat Chorus]

By the time the tide had rolled in and rolled out
We were bridgin' the gaps between two college towns

[Repeat Chorus]
