Lyrics:


Past our exit five ago
Four lanes to county roads
Playlist lighting up the dark
808s and poundin' hearts

Don't tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowin'
Girl don't you know I got the key to your heart
In my car, let's go far

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there's no cares
Me and you out there all alone
Moonlight shinin', county ridin'
Not one bar on our phones
Countin' the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don't wanna be found
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere

Static buildin' up in here
Where you take me I don't care
The further we get the closer we are
Blurrin' the lines under midnight stars

Won't tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowin'
Yeah boy you know you got the key to my heart
In your car, take me far

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there's no cares
Me and you out there all alone
Moonlight shinin', county ridin'
Not one bar on our phones
Countin' the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don't wanna be found
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere

We're young in the highway, goes on forever
Come on girl, no time to waste, it's now or never
We're young in the highway, goes on forever
And ever, and ever

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there's no cares
Me and you out there all alone
Moonlight shinin', county ridin'
Not one bar on our phones
Countin' the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don't wanna be found
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
