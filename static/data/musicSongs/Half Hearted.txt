Lyrics:


I can't believe that I hated
All the times that you waited
For me to come home, baby now I see
That it was just love
Now the house is empty
You said you never wanna see me
I thought that this is what I wanted
Now I see that I was wrong

Baby, I messed up
I'll never find someone better for me
I was the one starting the fights
You were the one who was always right
You showed no mercy
And left me with nothing but memories
Now I need to show you, you're a part of me

I'll make this what it used to be
I'm half of you, you're half of me
Without you I'm just half complete
I'll lay foundation for the floor
I won't be half outside the door
For you, I'll make this home complete
It won't be half, half hearted
Without you I'm half, half hearted
I'll finish what we started, started
I won't leave you half hearted, hearted

I was someone you admired
The one you truly desired
But I left you so tired of me
And now you're gone
Every night I spend awake
From the silence your absence makes
If you can forgive my mistakes
And just take me back

You showed no mercy
And left me with nothing but memories
Now I need to show you, you're a part of me

I'll make this what it used to be
I'm half of you, you're half of me
Without you I'm just half complete
I'll lay foundation for the floor
I won't be half outside the door
For you, I'll make this home complete
It won't be half, half hearted
Without you I'm half, half hearted
I'll finish what we started, started
I won't leave you half hearted, hearted
It won't be half, half hearted
Without you I'm half, half hearted
I'll finish what we started, started
I won't leave you half hearted
