Lyrics:


This could be easy darling
You can be freaky, I'll be bad
This could be easy darling
If we just let go, know what we meant to do

Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment
I got your red lipstick all on my neck cause that what you wanting
Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong
My mind is racing, two words, one thought

Take your high heels off, let's dance some more
Never felt like this before
I can feel it burn inside my head
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off

This could be easy darling
You can be mommy, I'll be dad, ooh
This could be easy darling
If we just let go, girl I'm in love with you

Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment
I got your red lipstick all on my neck cause that what you wanting
Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong
My mind is racing, two words, one thought

Take your high heels off, let's dance some more
Never felt like this before
I can feel it burn inside my head
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off, take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off

Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment
I got your red lipstick all on my neck cause that what you wanting
Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off, take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
