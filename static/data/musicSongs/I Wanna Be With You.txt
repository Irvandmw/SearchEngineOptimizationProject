Lyrics:


I got somethin' on my mind
And it's drivin' me insane
No matter how hard I try
To you it's all a game

I got somethin' I wanna say
I got somethin' I wanna do
When the sun shines
I wanna be with you

I haven't seen you in a week it's true
We'd better get together 'fore we're through
'Cause I got somethin' I wanna say to you
Make it easy

Because I've tried so hard to forget
But that somethin' I'll never do
'Cause when the sun shines
I wanna be with you

I haven't seen you in a week it's true
We'd better get together 'fore we're through
'Cause I got somethin' I wanna say to you
Make it easy

Because I got somethin' I wanna say
I got somethin' I wanna do
When the sun shines
I wanna be with you
When the sun shines
I wanna be with you
When the sun shines
I wanna be with you
