Lyrics:


Let me tell you about Rosey, she was a friend of mine
She wore a Batman t-shirt, she always dressed so fine
One day she went walking. It was about midnight.
When the police inspector, he took her for a ride
She said

Everybody needs someone, somebody to love
Everybody needs someone, a little help from above
You can shine it on, we all belong, you can't go wrong
With someone to love

With someone to love

Everybody needs someone, somebody to love
Everybody needs someone, a little help from above
You can shine it on, we all belong, you can't go wrong
With someone to love

Let me tell about Sadie, a lady friend of mine
One late rainy Sunday the preacher man stopped by
He said Sadie, you're evil, take off that evil disguise
As she made her donation, the man began to cry
She said

Everybody needs someone, somebody to love
Everybody needs someone, a little help from above
You can shine it on, we all belong, you can't go wrong
With someone to love

With someone to love
