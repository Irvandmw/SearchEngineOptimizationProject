Lyrics:


I know that someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody new
You expect me to be true and keep on loving you
Though I am feeling blue, you think I can't forget you

Until someday, you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody new
Although you don't want me now
I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you

I know that someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody new
Although you don't want me now
Oh, I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you
