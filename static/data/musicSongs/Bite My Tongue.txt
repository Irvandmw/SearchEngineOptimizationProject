Lyrics:


It's getting hard to bite my tongue
Making me feel so dumb
Can't explain it, feel so numb
So let me think about it, um, 'bout it, 'bout it

Oh, oh, I'm thinking how to say
Oh, oh, a million different ways
Oh, oh, I'm thinking how to say
Let's get up out this place

I promise I won't bite my tongue
Oh woah
I promise I won't bite my tongue
Oh woah

Girl I'm not gonna kiss and run
I shoot it off like a gun
Bang, bang, I'mma kill for you, I live for the thrill of you
And I'mma not tryna do you wrong

Oh, oh, I'm thinking how to say
Oh, oh, a million different ways
Oh, oh, I'm thinking how to say
Let's get up out this place

We can take it London to LA
I promise I won't bite my tongue
Oh woah, oh woah
Oh woah, oh woah

Ooh, ooh
Girl, I'ma kill for you
I live for the thrill of you
I'm not tryna do you wrong

Baby I promise not to bite my tongue
Bite my tongue
I'm not tryna do you wrong
