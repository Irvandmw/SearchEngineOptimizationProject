Lyrics:


I come from just the other side of nowhere to this big time lonesome town
They got a lotta ice and snow here half as cold as all the people I found
Every way I've tried to go here seems to bring me down
Seen about enough to know where I belong

I've got a mind to see the headlight
Shining on that old white line between my heart and home
Sick of spendin' Sundays wishing they were Mondays sittin' in a park alone
So give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me any lovin' way but wrong
Tell 'em that the pride of just the other side of nowhere going home

Taking nothing but to show there for these dues that I've paid
But the soul I almost sold here and the body I've been given away
Fadin' from the neon night time glow here headin' for the light of day
Just the other side of nowhere going home
Just the other side of nowhere going home
