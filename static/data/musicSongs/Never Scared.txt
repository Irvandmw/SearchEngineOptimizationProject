[Lil Mosey:]
Yuh, yuh
Ooh, ooh
Ayy Royce
Ayy Royce
Ayy Royce
Ayy Royce, you did it right here

Rich nigga to the right, you broke get over there
I was really runnin' since a baby, was never scared
I'm the biggest nigga in my city could be the mayor
And I'm sold on lean, but I'm still gonna say a prayer
I been getting bread now
Got a new chain, and bust down
Ask me how I got here, yeah, I don't know how
Now a nigga up, yeah, they know now
All my niggas reckless, yeah
What are you about?

All my diamonds glistening (Yeah, they glistening)
Take a brick, then I I'm flippin' (Yeah, I'm flippin)
Like a hoe, I was whippin' (Skrrt, skrrt)
I got a cast and I'm drippin' (Yeah, I'm drippin')
Yeah, Balmain jeans and I'm rockin' (I'm rockin)
I got deals but I'm still fucking flockin' (Yeah I'm flockin')
Nigga you're broke, stop talking (Stop talking)
Drippin' watch, how the fuck I'm walkin'?

Rich nigga to the right, you broke get over there
I was really runnin' since a baby, was never scared
I'm the biggest nigga in my city could be the mayor
And I'm sold on lean, but I'm still gonna say a prayer
I been getting bread now
Got a new chain, and bust down
Ask me how I got here, yeah, I don't know how
Now a nigga up, yeah, they know now
All my niggas reckless, yeah
What are you about?

[Trippie Redd:]
We out yo fucking league
We tote Fucking beams
We donât do fucking beans
Yeah yeah
Sippin on this fuckin lean
Say you stunting on me bitch
In yo fuckin dreams
Rich niggas over here
And broke niggas over there
I like my bitches in twos, yes in pairs
I like my bitch in Jimmy Chooâs playing with her hair With the I donât care
