Lyrics:


So curious, so curious.
Iâm so curious, about our love. 
I donât understand, why you donât take my hand,
And tell me you care. I see all the signs, 
But if you wanna be mine, donât leave me up in the air.

Oh baby
You better let your love show, hereâs what Iâm telling you 
Let me know or let me go:
Iâm so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do?
I do
Iâm so curious, what do you think of me
Boy am I just a game, or do you feel the same
As I do?

So curious, so curious.
Iâm so curious, about our love.
If its make believe,
Why donât you set my heart free?
And tell me goodbye.
But if itâs for real, tell me you feel for me
Way deep down inside.

Oh baby
Is this goodbye or hello? Hereâs what Iâm telling you
Let me know or let me go:
Iâm so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do?
I do
Iâm so curious, what do you think of me
Boy am I just a game, or do you feel the same
As I do?

So curious 
All day all night I just dream of you
I think about all the things that we could do
Iâm dying for and Iâm living for the day
When you could have been up 
And say you feel the same you feel like I do

 Iâm so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do?
I do
Iâm so curious, what do you think of me
Boy am I just a game, or do you feel the same
As I do? [x2]
