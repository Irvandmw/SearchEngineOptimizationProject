Artist: Don McLean Lyrics
Song Name: The Legend Of Andrew McCrew
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


There was a mummy at the fair, all crumpled in a folding chair.
The people passed, but didn't care that the mummy was a man,
so tell me if you can

[Chorus:]
Who are you? Who are you?
Where have you been, where are you going to?
Well, Andrew McCrew must have lost his way
'Cause though he died long ago he was buried today.

[Verse 1:]
Down on nightmare alley, where the shady people sway
a hobo came a-hikin' on a salty summer day
Well he hopped a freight in Dallas, and he rode out of sight
But on a turn he slipped, and he lost his grip
and he fell in-to the night.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2: (same chords as first throughout all other verses)]
Well, Andrew had one leg of wood, the other leg was small.
And when he fell off the train that night he found he had no legs at all.
Well they found him in the thicket, and the undertaker came.
And they mummified his body for a relative to claim.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
But no one came to claim him, until the carnival passed through.
The carnies took him to their tent and they decided what to do.
Well they dressed him in a worn-out tugs and they put him on a stand.
And millions saw the legend called the 'famous mummy man'.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
Well, what a way to live a life and what a way to die.
Left to live a living death with noone left to cry.
Petrified amazement, and wonder beyond words,
A man who found more life in death than life gave him at birth.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 5:]
But what about the ones who live and wish that they could go.
Whose lives are lost to living and performing for the show.
Well at least you got the best of life until it got the best of you,
