Lyrics:


Well in the town where I was raised, 
the clock ticked and the cattle grazed 
Time passed with amazing grace, 
Back where I come from 

You can lie on a river bank, 
paint your name on a water tank 
Miscount all the beers you drank, 
Back where I come from 

[Chorus]

Back where I come from 
Where I'll be when its said and done 
I'm proud as anyone 
That's where I come from 

We learned in Sunday school, 
who made the sun shine through 
I know who made the moon shine too, 
Back where I come from 

Blue eyes on a Saturday night, 
tan legs in the broad daylight 
TV's they were black and white, 
Back where I come from 

[Chorus]

Back where I come from 
Where I'll be when its said and done 
I'm proud as anyone 
That's where I come from 

Some say it's a backward place, 
narrow minds on a narrow wage 
But I make it a point to say, 
that's where I come from 

[Chorus]

Back where I come from 
Where I'll be when its said and done 
I'm proud as anyone 
That's where I come from 

That's where I come from 
I'm an old Tennessean 
Well Im proud as anyone 

That's where I come from
