Lyrics:


When you fight so hard but nothing seems to turn out right
When it breaks your heart and life seems like the longest fight
When all you see is trees but you can't see the forest
Oh baby turn to me, I'll show you where the light is
You can count on me, I'll stitch you into my heart
You know I carry you so deep in my heart

Oh my, oh my love's in the air
The fire, the flame, I'm there
Yes, my love's here on earth
The ocean, death and birth
Yes, my love's in the sky
The pain you feel tonight
Through this joy I call life

So when you feel alone, like nobody will help you
Just think of me in all my heart I have kept you
You can count on me, I'll stitch you into my heart
You know I carry you so deep in my heart

Oh my, oh my love's in the air
The fire, the flame, I'm there
Yes, my love's here on earth
The ocean, death and birth
Yes, my love's in the sky
The pain you feel tonight
Through this joy I call life

Through tsunamis, earthquakes or a broken spirit
When you scream with your voice, you know I will hear it
When you scream with no voice, you know I will hear it
You know I will come running when I feel the earth move

Through a flood, toil and blood, through the tides of terror
Feel my love, feel my love, let it breathe forever
You know I will come running when I feel the earth move

Oh my, oh my love's in the air
The fire, the flame, I'm there
Yes, my love's here on earth
The ocean, death and birth
Yes, my love's in the sky
The pain you feel tonight
Through this joy I call life
