Lyrics:


I shoulda saw it comin'
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie

But baby you were so good, so good
You had me goin' blind
You said he was your best friend,
I'm guessing I wasn't your type

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad 'cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

Now that it's over
(I'm coming)
I just wanna break your heart right back
Right back
(I'm coming)
Want you to cry me a river
(I'm coming)
I just wanna break your heart right back

Yeah all this time, I was blind
Running 'round telling everybody
(I'm coming)

My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me
(I'm coming)

You said I was your best,
Would be your last
Now he's gone, you're alone
Don't want you back

You're tellin' me you're sorry
Well sorry, I'm over it
'Cause I've already been there done that
Ain't doing this again, no

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad 'cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

Now that it's over
(I'm coming)
I just wanna break your heart right back
Right back
(I'm coming)
Want you to cry me a river
(I'm coming)
I just wanna break your heart right back

Yeah all this time,
I was blind
Running 'round telling everybody
(I'm coming)

My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me
(I'm coming)

My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me
(I'm coming)

[Childish Gambino:]
Listen, you got a man but your man ain't loyal
Don't understand how to spell it out for you
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask Y
Sorry had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw I'm a sick guy
Money too much
I step on stage and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, and you know it's true 'cause
OK, G-A-M-B-I-N-O
I know they hate but I don't know why
I know the way he did you was whack
But I know how you can get dude right back
(you can get with me)

And now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back
Right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just wanna break your heart right back

Yeah all this time, I was blind
Running 'round telling everybody

My baby loves me
(Does he really though?)
My baby loves me
(Does he really though?)
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me
(I'm coming)

My baby loves me
(Does he really though?)
My baby loves me
(Does he really though?)
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me
(I'm coming)

Runnin' 'round town telling everybody
(I'm coming)
Runnin' 'round town telling everybody
(I'm coming)
Runnin' 'round town telling everybody
(I'm coming)
Runnin' 'round town telling everybody
(I'm coming)

I'm comin' out (say, say)
He's comin' (hey)
I'm comin' out
