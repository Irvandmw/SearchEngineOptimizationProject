Lyrics:


[Shane:]
I've had many times I can tell you
Times when innocence I'd trade for company
And children saw me crying
I thought I had my share of that
But these miss you nights are the longest

[Bryan:]
Midnight diamonds stud my heaven
Southwards burning like the jewels that eye your place
And the warm winds that embrace me
Just as surely kissed your face
Yet those miss you nights they're the longest

[(Mark) Shane:]

(Lay down) Lay down all thoughts of your surrender
It's only me who's killing time
(Play down) play down all dreams once remembered
It's just the same this miss you game

[Mark:]
Thinking of my going
How to cut the thread and leave it all behind
Looking windwards, for my compass
I take each day as it arrives
But these miss you nights are the longest

[Shane:]
But these miss you nights are the longest
