Lyrics:


We're born innocent, found guilty
Living life is treated like a crime
We're born innocent, found guilty
Everytime
Our best never beats our worst
Its a funny as its perverse
We're born innocent, found guilty
Everytime

Blame parents blame religion
And the papers and the television
Blame ourselves for causing pain
We love to blame
We ditch the things that we make
Us hate ourselves
Just to replace them with something else
We're born innocent, found guilty
Everytime

Make claim and counter claim
Bribe the jury, and its still the same
Their verdicts already in
you can't win

Make claim and counter claim
Bribe the jury, and its still the same
Their verdicts already in
you can't win

We're born innocent, found guilty
Living life is treated like a crime
We're born innocent, found guilty
Everytime
Our best never beats our worst
Its a funny as its perverse
We're born innocent, found guilty
Everytime
