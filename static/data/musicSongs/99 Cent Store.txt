Lyrics:


I had pinwheels in my eyes for you
Blinded by the pinks and blues
Oh, you were my wind-up Romeo
We had matching bubblegum tattoos
Serenade me with your kazoo
You tricked me with your ribbons and your bows

It's so shiny in a shopping cart
Pretty in a parking lot
But when you go home, that's when it falls apart

I still think about you sometimes
Only when I walk through the 99 cent store
Oh, you sold me all those cheap lies
Could've built me a whole 99 cent store

Wine-and-dine me with your plastic food
Rob me of my sweet tooth
Held me up with the loaded water gun
Tied me to these toy train tracks
You left me there and you never came back
Tacky souvenirs when it's said and done

It's so shiny in a shopping cart
Pretty in a parking lot
But when you go home, that's when it falls apart

I still think about you sometimes
Only when I walk through the 99 cent store
Oh, you sold me all those cheap lies
Could've built me a whole 99 cent store

I still think about you sometimes
Only when I walk through the 99 cent store
Oh, you sold me all those cheap lies
Could've built me a whole 99 cent store

I still think about you sometimes
Only when I walk through the 99 cent store
