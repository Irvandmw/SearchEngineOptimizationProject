Lyrics:


What you been doin, ain't you got no one
Where you been keepin' yourself my friend
Have you been hidin' underground writin'
Foolin' yourself in your special way
Where's your old lady
She was a nice girl
Maybe it's best that she went away
You will be losin' nothing can change you
Happiness spits in your face always
Where are you going, what will you see there
You never learn nothin' by runnin' away
What you been doin, ain't you got no one
Where you been keepin' yourself my friend
Loneliness growin' Emptiness showin'
Finding your peace two or three times a day
three times a day
