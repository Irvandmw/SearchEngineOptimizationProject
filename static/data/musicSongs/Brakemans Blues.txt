Lyrics:


Portland Main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
â¨Portland Main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
â¨Any old place I hang my hat is Home Sweet Home to meâ¨
â¨Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
â¨Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
â¨It read it's good times here but better on down the roadâ¨
â¨Eat my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleans
â¨Eat my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleansâ¨
I'm going to get me a momma, Lord I ain't never seen
â¨â¨Where was you momma when the train left the shed?
â¨Where was you momma when the train left the shed?
â¨Standin' in my front door, wishin' to God I was dead
