Lyrics:


We loved some and we fought some
We won some and we lost some
We were awful, we were awesome
Weren't we, coach

We worked hard then we were lazy
We were heroes, we were babies
Made you proud then drove you crazy
Didn't we, coach

All those mottos
All those reasons
All those rhymes
The stay priceless
They come right back
Right on time

You were a teacher, a preacher
A mother, a father
A lot less taker than giver
A keeper of secrets
And constantly making
Believers outta quitters
For all of your time
And your heart and your soul
You deserve a lot more than a toast
But here's to you, and thanks again
We'll never forget you, coach

The papers loved to hate you
Wasn't worth near what they paid you
But it never seemed to phase you
Did it, coach

And those fans could be fair weather
But you kept us all together
Found a way to make us better
Somehow, coach

Your door was always open
Rain or shine
All those hats you wore
Will always blow my mind

You were a teacher, a preacher
A mother, a father
A lot less taker than giver
A keeper of secrets
And constantly making
Believers outta quitters
For all of your time
And your heart and your soul
You deserve a lot more than a toast
But here's to you, and thanks again
We'll never forget you, coach

For all of your time
And your heart and your soul
You deserve a lot more than a toast
So here's to you, and thanks again
We'll love you and we'll hold you in
Our hearts there with
The things that matter most
We'll never forget you, coach

Oh God bless you, coach
We'll never forget you, coach
We'll never forget you, coach
