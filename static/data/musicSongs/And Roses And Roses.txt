Lyrics:


Everyday I sent another present, 
Just to let her know how very much I care... 
Wrote a little love note with each present, 
But it didn't seem to get me anywhere... 

My poor worried heart was almost certain, 
That this love affair would never be... 
Then I sent a dozen yellow roses, 
Then from that moment she belonged to me... 

Roses, roses, roses I thank all the roses 
That bloom in the spring... 
Love is a wonderful thing, 

The rest of my life I will bring her 
Roses and roses and roses of love... 

Roses, roses, roses I thank you for saying 
What I couldn't say... 
Oh!, what a wonderful way, 
To tell her, "I Love You" each day, 
With roses and roses and roses of love... 
And roses and roses and roses of love, 
And roses and roses and roses...
