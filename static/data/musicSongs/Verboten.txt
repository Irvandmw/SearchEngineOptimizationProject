Lyrics:


Our love is verboten they tell us we are worlds apart

And we are forbidden to care.
Verboten
verboten the dream I treasure in my heart

A dream we're forbidden to share.
It's just like forbidding the morning sun to rise at dawn

Forbidding the stars to shine above.
For we know
true love cannot be verboten

And no matter what they say

I'll give you my love.
