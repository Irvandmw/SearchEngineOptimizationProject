Lyrics:


Hoped you were different, babe
But you're all the same
So beautiful, so insane
Yeah, it's crossed my mind just a couple times
I must resist your love, gotta put up a fight

But, when you dance for me, dance for me
How could I resist the way you move?
Shawty, you're breaking me, breaking me
I don't understand the things you do

Baby, I know your type
Your body can control my mind
And damn, you look good tonight
Heaven knows, I know you ain't right
Cause baby, I know you're tight
Your body can control my mind
And damn, you look good tonight
Can't help but worry, worry
Cause my vision's blurry

My vision's blurry
My, my vision's blurry
My vision's blurry

So much energy you could take from me
Then tear my heart in two way too easily
Heard the words they said, might take a chance instead
You got a hold on me, shame messing with my head

But when you dance for me, dance for me
How could I resist the way you move?
Shawty, you're breaking me, breaking me
I don't understand the things you do

Baby, I know your type
Your body can control my mind
And damn, you look good tonight
Heaven knows, I know you ain't right
Cause baby, I know you're tight
Your body can control my mind
And damn, you look good tonight
Can't help but worry, worry
Cause my vision's blurry

My vision's blurry
My, my vision's blurry
My, my, my vision's blurry
My vision's blurry
