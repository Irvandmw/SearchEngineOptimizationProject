Lyrics:


[John speaking...]
"Ok,Ok.Ready? Ok,dynamics with tension, fun and laughter for all. Honkey rock."
1, 2, 1 2 3 4,

If you knew, Peggy Sue
Then you'd know why I feel blue,
about Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, yes I love you Peggy Sue
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue, pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl and I need you Peggy Sue
I love you, Peggy Sue, with a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, and I want you Peggy Sue
"Look out"
