Lyrics:


Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning when you find your heart a home
I've seen it in the movies, read about it in a book
I never thought I would feel it, but your touch was all it took

Take good care of my heart, take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it - you're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should, but it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever - you're the one to take good care of my heart

Come and make your magic 'til you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer, I'll be drowning in your eyes
You're the one I needed most, when my love was on the line
I'm so glad you gave me yours, when I gave you mine

So take good care of my heart, take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it - you're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should, but it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever - you're the one to take good care of my heart

I love you more than I should, but it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever - you're the one to take good care of my heart

Take good care of my heart, take good care of my heart (take good care of me)
Baby, you're the first to take it - you're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should, but it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever - you're the one to take good care of my heart

(Take good care of my heart, take good care of my heart) won't you please?
Baby, you're the first to take it, and you're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
