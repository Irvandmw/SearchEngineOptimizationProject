Lyrics:


Ohhh

We started out as the greatest romance of the twentieth century
But that burning love that I once felt, well, itâs ancient history
He used to really do something to me
But somewhere, something went wrong
(Something went wrong)

Lord, itâs hard to tell your lover that the love you once had is gone
Well, I searched the words of wise men
(Well, I searched the words of wise men)
Put my ear to the ground
(Put my ear to the ground)
But there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
(There ain't no easy way to let your lover down)
No, there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
(Ain't no easy way to let your lover down)
Ainât no easy way to let your lover down

You know we started out like a house on fire
But the fire soon burned itself out and now all thatâs left in the smoldering ashes is misery and doubt
(Misery and doubt)

All along Iâve been telling him that he is the only one
(The only one)
How do I tell him that what I felt, well, itâs all over and done?
Over and done
Well, I searched the words of wise men
(I searched the words of wise men)
I put my ear to the ground
(I put my ear to the ground)

But there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
But there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
No, there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
No, there ainât no easy way to let your lover down

Sock it to me
Owwww
Oh yeah

I was so sure that I found it this time
He was going to give me his name

Ohhh, but in the morning when weâre making love, baby
It just donât feel the same
He was quite a lover when we started
A regular Romeo
(A regular Romeo)

Lord, I wish there was an easy way
Lord, I wish there was an easy way
But one of us has got to go

Well, I searched the words of wise men
Well, I searched the words of wise men
(Well I searched the words of wise men)
Put my ear to the ground
Put my ear to the ground
But, there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
But, there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
No, there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
No, there ainât no easy way to let your lover down

No, no, no, no
There ainât no easy way to let your lover down
I said there ainât no easy way to let your lover down

Got to get your
Ainât no easy way to let your lover down
Ainât no easy way to let your mama to let you down
I said baby

Ainât no easy way to let your lover down
Ainât no easy way to let your lover down
Let me tell ya that there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
No, there ainât no easy way to let your lover down
There ainât no easy way to let your lover down
Aha
Ainât no easy way to let you down
