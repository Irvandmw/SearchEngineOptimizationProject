[Adam Levine:]
Aren't we too grown for games?
Aren't we too grown to play around?
Young enough to chase
But old enough to know better
[SZA:]
Are we too grown for changin'?
Are we too grown to mess around?
Ooh and I can't wait forever baby
Both of us should know better

Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Tryna' do what lovers do (ooh)
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Tryna' do what lovers do (ooh, ooh)
