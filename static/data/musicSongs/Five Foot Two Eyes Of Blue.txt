Lyrics:


Five foot two, eyes of blue
But oh what those five foot could do
Has anybody seen my gal

Turned up nose and turned down hose
Never had another beau
Has anybody seen my gal

Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur
Diamond rings and all those things
Bet your life it isn't hers
Could she love and could she woo
Could she could she could she coo
Has anybody seen my gal

Five foot two, eyes of blue but oh what those five foot could do
Has anybody seen my gal
Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur
Diamond rings and all those things
Bet your life that it wasn't her

Could she love and could she coo
Could she could she could she woo
Has anybody seen my gal
