Lyrics:


I am aching
Near breaking
I'm just taking my time
Just stand in line
For a dance with you, woah
A dance with you, woah

It may not appear
But it's been fully clear
That I'm standing here
Fully pleading
Near bleeding
Dying, competing
For a chance with you, oh, woah

Passion tops, time stops
Volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby I could stay forever in time
As I dance with you...
You...
You...

If you stand with my heart in hand, oh
Perfect and, perfect and, perfect and
So I wanna layer
Of my longing stare
And all I care
Is a dance with you

Passion tops, time stops
Volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby I could stay forever in time
As I dance with you...
You...
You...

I freeze, I feel the breeze
My hands been seized, my thoughts occur
I close my eyes and
Knowing it's not you but
There's a chance it's you...
For a dance with me, oh, woah

Passion tops, time stops
Volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby I could stay forever in time
As I dance with you...
You...
You...
