Lyrics:


[Nick and Miley:]
A word is just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away

We've all got a gift
Yeah something to give
To make a change

Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts a fire

With one little action
The chain reaction
Will never stop

Make it strong
Shine a light and send it on

[Demi and Joe:]
Just smile and the world
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who become two

If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can do

If we send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts a fire

With one little action
The chain reaction
Will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light and send it on

[Selena, Miley and Demi:]
Send it on
There's power in all of the choices we make
So I'm starting now there's not a moment to waste

[Selena and Kevin:]
A words just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away

[Everyone:]
Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts a fire

With one little action
The chain reaction
Will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light and send it on

Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts a fire

With one little action
The chain reaction
Will help things start
Make us strong
Shine a light and send it on
Shine a light and send it on
Shine a light and send it on
Shine a light and send it on
