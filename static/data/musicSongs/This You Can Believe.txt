Lyrics:


Whatever seems fair to you
Cause I wanna go and be ever true
So this love for us will grow
And then we both will know
Happiness is everything we share through

Ooh, you always say that I'm looking good
I wanna do more for you than I think I should
Tender love should last for years
A lot of long remembered wasted tears
I wanna be sure the things you say are true

Oh, these are the real things
Ooh baby, these are the true things, yes they are

You're the kind of fellow that a girl wants to know
Just another devil who make me take this sweet load
You make me feel so happy
Give me the things I need in you
I wanna be sure that the words you say are true, baby

Such peaceful loving bring so much time
Your delicious tender kisses knowing you're mine
Seems that everywhere we go
All our friends seem to know
You belong to me and I belong to you

Ooh honey, these are the real things
Yeah, these are the true things (these are the real things)
Ooh (these are the real things)
These are the real things
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, these are the real things, baby, yeah

Whatever seems fair to you
Cause I wanna go, and, ooh, be ever true
So that this love for us will grow
And then we both will know
Happiness is everything we share through

Ooh, sugar, you always tell me that I'm looking good
I wanna do more for you than I think I should, baby
Tender love should last for years
A lot of long remembered wasted tears
I wanna be sure the word you say is true

These are the real things (these are the real things)
These are the true things (these are the real things)
These are the real (these are the real things)
Yes they are baby, these are the true things (these are the real things)
Oh, oh yeah, these are the real things (these are the real things)
Oh, oh, these are the true things (these are the real things)
Real, real things (these are the real things)
Hey (these are the real things)
Yeah, yeah, these are (these are the real things)
Ooh, oh, things
