Lyrics:


Niggas, get your milla genuine draft, cause its milla time, we about to go hard on these hoes on
this one right here.

[Chorus]
[soopafly] Can you control your hoe? (You got a bitch that wont do what you say)
You canât control your hoe? (She hardheaded, she just wonât obey)
Can you control your hoe? (Youâve got to know what to do, and what to say)
Youâve got to put that bitch in her place, even if itâs slapping her in her face.
Ya got to control your hoe. Can you control your hoe? 

I went to your house; your girl came in and started cussing you out. You should have slapped her
in her face, I wanted to tell you, but it wasnât my place. I kept it on the low, cause I know you
was gonna check that hoe. But instead, you was quiet as a mouse, maybe you started to think it
wasnât your house. Cause she was acting like a nut, you got a kind of bitch that would kick your
butt. What kind of pimp holds back? Never met a bitch that a pimp canât slap, whats wrong with
the pimpinâ? Why you get a whippinâ? All I got to say is this:

[Chorus]

[Verse: 2]
This is what you made me do; I really didnât want to put hands on you. But bitch you playinâ
with fire, i'm so sick and tired, of loud mouth bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips
on you, cause bitch you playinâ with fire, i'm so sick and tired. 

This is what you forced me to do, I really didnât want to put hands on you, but bitch you
playinâ with fire, i'm so sick and tired. Of bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips on
you, bitch you playinâ with fire, Iâm so sick and tired.  

[Chorus]
(No: can you control your hoe? At the end.)
