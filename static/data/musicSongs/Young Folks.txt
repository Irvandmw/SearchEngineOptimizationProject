Lyrics:


If I told you things I did before, told you how I used to be,
would you go along with someone like me?
If you knew my story word for word, had all of my history,
would you go along with someone like me?

I did before and had my share, it didn't lead nowhere,
I would go along with someone like you.
It doesn't matter what you did or who you're hanging with,
we could stick around and see this night through.

And we don't care about the young folks talkin' 'bout the young style,
and we don't care about the old folks talkin' 'bout the old style too.
And we don't care about their own folks talkin' 'bout their own style,
and all we care 'bout is talking, talking only me and you.

Usually when things have gone this far, people tend to disappear,
no one will surprise me unless you do.
I can tell there's something goin' on, hours seems to disappear,
everyone is leaving, I'm still with you.

It doesn't matter what we do, where we are going to,
we can stick around and see this night through.

And we don't care about the young folks talkin' 'bout the young style,
and we don't care about the old folks talkin' 'bout the old style too.
And we don't care about their own folks talkin' 'bout their own style,
and all we care 'bout is talking, talking only me and you.

And we don't care about the young folks talkin' 'bout the young style,
and we don't care about the old folks talkin' 'bout the old style too.
And we don't care about their own folks talkin' 'bout their own style,
and all we care 'bout is talking, talking only me and you.

And we don't care about the young folks talkin' 'bout the young style,
and we don't care about the old folks talkin' 'bout the old style too.
And we don't care about their own folks talkin' 'bout their own style,
and all we care 'bout is talking, talking only me and you.
Talking only me and you.
Talking only me and you.
