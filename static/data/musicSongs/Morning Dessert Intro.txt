Lyrics:


Good morning
Time to get ready for work
I've been waiting
Get up, morning love, time to get ready for work

You might be a little late, I donât think an hour will hurt
Touch me here, touch me there
Lemme give you your morning dessert
I'm not hungry for food, all I want is you

Time to get ready for work
Are you ready for me?
Let's go
