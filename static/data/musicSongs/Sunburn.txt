Lyrics:


Youâre not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, Iâm searching for what used to be mine

I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things arenât clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Iâd miss you
I miss you

She was mine
I was hers
And all thatâs in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things arenât clear

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Iâd miss you
And I miss you

Donât drop me in
Itâs not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
If you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

Donât drop me in
Itâs not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Iâd miss you
I miss you
