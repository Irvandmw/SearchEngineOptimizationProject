Lyrics:


Waffles are better (Ooh...)
Waffles are better (Ooh...)

I don't eat breakfast much
But niggas look at me like I'm breakfast, lunch, and
Dinner motherfucker, makin' bread croissants
And Captain Crunch and
Eggs and lucks and
Wakin' up at seven
Just to get to work I'm eatin' Eggo's, like eleven
I don't even really wanna give the wrong impression
But he all up in my kitchen
And it look like Armageddon
He could tell it's an addiction
So I tell him my obsession
Then I fling open the fridge and ask
That nigga one question (Yeah)
'Ayy you like waffles?' (This nigga)

Waffles are better
Waffles are better (Ah, ah)
Waffles are better nigga
Waffles (Fuck pancakes)
Fuck pancakes

Waffle power
Waffle power
I could eat waffles in the shower
Make it in a heart shape or a flower
All you eat is pancakes, you're a coward
I could eat a thousand in one hour
Stack 'em all up and climb the tower
Keep your damn pancakes, waffles ours
Man, fuck pancakes, they make me sick
I mean it's like I'm eatin' donuts, it's way too thick
Kinda like my lifestyle, man, it's way too rich
I don't know why you like crepes, man, they way too thin

And I just want it crispy
That chicken on it dripping in honey
I know what you're missing
If you ain't with me then you're tripping honey

Waffles are better (Ba da da da ba da da da da)
Waffles are better (Ba da da da ba da da da da)

Fuck pancakes, they taste like shit
They taste like shit, they taste like shit
Fuck pancakes, they taste like shit
They taste like shit, they taste like shit
Waffles are better (Ooh...)
Ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah
Like ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah
Waffles are better (Ooh...)
Waffles are better
