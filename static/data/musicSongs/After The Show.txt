Lyrics:


Been on every stage
In every place
Been around the world and back again
A million times

But some things
They never change
No matter what I do, it's always you
That's on my mind

Even when I'm out of this game
I'm always gonna be the same
Are you gonna change?

I gotta know
If you're still gonna care for me
After the show
When I'm no longer on MTV
I gotta know
Will you be there when the times get tough?
Are you still gonna give me love
Or are you gonna leave me in the cold
After the show?

After the show
Listen

When I'm steppin' out
Of the spotlight
And I'm on this stage for the last time
Will you walk away?

Will you be there?
Look me in the eyes
Then I'll know
It was worth the sacrifice

Even when I'm out of this game
I'm always gonna be the same
Are you gonna change?

I gotta know
If you're still gonna care for me
After the show
When I'm no longer on MTV
I gotta know
Will you be there when the times get tough?
Are you still gonna give me love
Or are you gonna leave me in the cold
After the show?

After the show
Come on

Will you give me love?
Will you still care?
Are you gonna be the same?
When I step down
Will you be there?
Are you gonna go and change?

Will you give me love?
Will you still care?
Even when I leave this game
When the lights out
Will you be there?
Are you gonna change?

I gotta know
If you're still gonna care for me
After the show
When I'm no longer on MTV
I gotta know
Will you be there when the times get tough?
Are you still gonna give me love
Or are you gonna leave me in the cold
After the show?

I gotta know
If you're still gonna care for me
After the show
When I'm no longer on MTV
I gotta know
Will you be there when the times get tough?
Are you still gonna give me love
Or are you gonna leave me in the cold
After the show?

After, after the show
After, after the show
After, after the show
After the show
