Lyrics:


If you say that you're not serious
Walk away and just forget about us
Hey baby
I'm not gonna take it this time
Oh no..
If you say that you're not good for me
You see no future in this unity
Hey baby
I'm not gonna take it this time
Oh no..

Yeah yeah..
I won't say stop because you ask me to
Don't leave our love behind
Honey won't you tell me, tell me
Why you messin with my mind

Cos you don't care nothin bout the things I do
You don't care nothin bout the pain you put me through
Show your feelings for me
Cos you don't care nothin bout the things I say
You don't care nothin bout the way I feel today
But I won't let love R.I.P

I won't take the way you're hurtin me
You gotta treat me with some dignity
Hey baby
I'm not gonna take it this time
Oh no..

Cos I'm much stronger than you think you know
Won't play your game this way
Honey won't you tell me, tell me
Just what you're tryin to say

Cos you don't care nothin bout the things I do
You don't care nothin bout the pain you put me through
Show your feelings for me
Cos you don't care nothin bout the things I say
You don't care nothin bout the way I feel today
But I won't let love R.I.P

Love R.I.P...
If you say that you're not serious
Walk away and just forget about us
Hey baby
I'm not gonna take it this time
I'm not gonna leave our love behind..

Cos you don't care nothin bout the things I do
You don't care nothin bout the pain you put me through
Show your feelings for me
Cos you don't care nothin bout the things I say
You don't care nothin bout the way I feel today
But I won't let love R.I.P

Cos you don't care nothin bout the things I do
You don't care nothin bout the pain you put me through
Show your feelings for me
Cos you don't care nothin bout the things I say
You don't care nothin bout the way I feel today
But I won't let love R.I.P
