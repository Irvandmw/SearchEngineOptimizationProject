Lyrics:


[Ella (Improvisation)]
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say "Nighty-night" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

[Louis]
Stars fading but I linger on dear
[Ella]
Oh how you linger on
[Louis]
Still craving your kiss
[Ella]
How you crave my kiss
[Louis]
Now I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this
[Ella]
Give me a little kiss

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

[Louis (Improvisation)]
Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
Yeah, I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this, yes

[Ella & Louis]
Sweet dreams
[Louis]
Dreamin'
[Ella]
Till sunbeams find you
Keep dreaming
[Louis]
Gotta keep dreamin'
[Ella]
Leave your worries far behind you
[Ella & Louis]
But in your dreams, whatever they be
[Ella]
You gotta make me a promise
Promise to me you'll dream
Dream a little dream of me
