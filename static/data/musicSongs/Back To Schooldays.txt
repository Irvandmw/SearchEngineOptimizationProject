Lyrics:


Don't seem to be no break in the line
Don't seem to be no break boys
They've ruined my vision, screwed up my eyes
Tell you what I'm gonna do boys

I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
Damn right

They learned me that it's like a film out here
It's a real hollow show boys
They told me it was all black and white
So many shades I can't see boys

I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
Damn right

Ain't nobody wants to know you when you're down
Everybody wants to lose you when you're found

Now if'n I'm thinkin' I might break even
I might go home on Friday
I married a rich girl but otherwise
I'm gonna raise hell and rightly

I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
Damn right

Now if'n I seem just a mite confused
Don't give me all of the blame boys
Twenty four years just to break the rules
No wonder I'm half insane boys

I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
Damn right

I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
I'm goin' back to schooldays
Damn right
