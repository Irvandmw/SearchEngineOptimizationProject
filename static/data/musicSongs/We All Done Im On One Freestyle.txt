[Intro]
They like where you been man
Iâm like youâll find out when you need to know
Poison, coming soon

H-town so throwed
If I said it then you know itâs what I mean
I do it all from my home
Cause thatâs who got me thinking Iâm the damn king
I proâly hurt a few feelings
Cause yâall be trickinâ on âem way too easy
See you can feed a few pigeons
Thatâs when you realise them hoes a tease

Live from the Bahamas
I gotta be honest
Working on a classic gotta forgive me for my silence
Swear it felt like college, knowledge that you gave was timeless
Knew that you had good brain, I knew youâd graduate with honours
My P was the finest, bowing like she paying homage
Pulling that ponytail girl what you mix with Pochahontos
Cesa triple zeros, working jumping over commas
You can say that I gave you love but you canât say I gave a promise
Girl no dollars

And girl Iâd love to kick it witâ ya but you know I gotta run
And stack some hundreds inbetween my trigger finger and my thumb
It was lovely while it lasted but I think the time has come
Hope you keep your composure when I say that itâs over

We all done
Darling, we all done
She said Iâm on one
Now that weâre all done, done, done
I might not cuff and I might not trick
I might just split cause we donât just fit
Donât come back cause she might be sick
Cause she might be the one that I say Iâm not with
When we all done
Now that weâre all done, done, done

Loving the way she grip me
Loving the way my grip be
Feeling off in my pocketsâ¦ and she history
Legends like Snoop and 50
Maybach Coupe like Ricky
Feeling just like my dick be weighing a tonne off in my dickies
Ball like Kenneth Griffey, hit it like Kenneth Griffey
They say stay on your toes, thatâs why Iâm always on my tippies
Watch the people close incase any one of yâall acting shifty
Lipstick on my hollow tip donât let this clique give you a hicky
Posted in between the pillow, laying near in the pyjamas
With the slickest Texas rhymer thatâs when you know you can find her
Tell the dead Iâm out of time, you know that thatâs a problem Iâma make her say
I know you didnât got her sounding just like Wonda
The 16th I be in Vegas, 26th I be in China
Booked âtil August, I come back and drop a mixtape in my honour
We live from the Bahamas, hope her panties is designer
I had your girl interior decorating her vagina

And girl Iâd love to kick it witâ ya but you know I gotta run
And stack some hundreds inbetween my trigger finger and my thumb
It was lovely while it lasted but I think the time has come
Hope you keep your composure when I say that itâs over

We all done
Darling, we all done
She said Iâm on one
Now that weâre all done, done, done
I might not cuff and I might not trick
I might just split cause we donât just fit
Donât come back cause she might be sick
Cause she might be the one that I say Iâm not with
She said Iâm on one
Now that weâre all done, done, done
