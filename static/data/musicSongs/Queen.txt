Lyrics:


It will never rain, never rain
If the great sky falls down, no rain, no more rain
Bloodâs pouring down, high alert, we watch it burn
Itâs a world undeceived, sirens, sirens
Everyoneâs whispering, the CIA, MI6
Hire the unknown
Weâre at the end of days
For heavenâs sake

The queenâs been slain
Sheâll never rule again
The queenâs been slain
Sheâll never rule again
Your queenâs been slain
Queenâs been slain

Black parade, motorcade
Destiny sings farewell, church bells
Is anyone listening, everywhere, bowed in prayer
Tears are falling, coming down, coming down
I hear the heavens calling, providence, no evidence
Thereâs no confirmation
Only silence remains
We only know one thing

The queenâs been slain
Sheâll never rule again
The queenâs been slain
Sheâll never rule again
Your queenâs been slain
Queenâs been slain

Who will take her place?
Itâs written on everyoneâs face
The truth is slowly dawning
I hear tomorrow calling
Some things canât be replaced
The realization of a new generation
On the eve of imitation
All gone, overthrown

The queenâs been slain
Sheâll never rule again
The queenâs been slain
Sheâll never rule again
Your queenâs been slain
Queenâs been slain

May God bless you all
May God bless you all
May God bless you all
