Lyrics:


I count the days that we have spent apart
I've got a bad liver and a broken heart
There's no salvation in the comfort of you
I finally realized you're tearing me apart

[Chorus:]
So help me, save me, tell me that the end is near
Help me, save me, tell me that the end is near
I am done with you

You made my life completely miserable
You drove me to the edge, you've caused me all this pain
But I've always loved you 'cause you're oh so special
I'm broken and I'm alone and I cannot maintain

[Chorus]

Done with you (done with you)
I am done with you (done with you)
I am done with you (done with you)
I am done with you (done with you, I'm done with you)

I count the days that we have spent apart
I've got a bad liver and a broken heart

Help me, save me,
Tell me that the end is near
Help me, save me,
Tell me that the end is here
I am done with you

Because you and me are through
You couldn't help me
You couldn't save me
Now I know the end is here
I am done with you
