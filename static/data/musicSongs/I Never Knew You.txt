Lyrics:


Tell me a secret, tell me anything
What's your weapon? What's your middle name?
What do you believe in? What's your animal?
Are you a cat or a dog person?
What's your outlook? What's your favourite saying?

Hey, maybe you laugh, maybe you laugh a lot
And maybe you started, but you somehow quit the pot
Or you may be a hippie and a democrat
Yeah I remember that
I think
And you might like wine
But you're not the type
Who likes to drink

What made me forget everything I know?
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios
Of unintelligent life echoing in stereo
On invisible mics wired into my mind
So I would like another look inside you
I would like to look inside you
Yes, I would love the chance to love you like I'd never known you

Or maybe you're sleeping on a telephone
And maybe you're dreaming of an anglophone
With a crooked smile
And maybe your profile boasts a brand new nose
And maybe your new job, it requires that you cannot wear any clothes

What made me forget everything I know?
All my beliefs replaced by scenarios
Of unintelligent life echoing in stereo
On invisible mics wired into my mind

So, I would like another look inside you
I would like to look inside you
Yes, I would love the chance to love you like I'd never known you

After all I am falling

Well, maybe your favourite colour is brown
You go and leave any gray
And maybe you're crying and you're not sure why
Maybe you're living in a whole new town
And maybe you're back with your old boyfriend and you're busy going down

What made me forget everything
All my beliefs, all my memories
All the episodes of you, especially the ones that hurt
And even a few that made me laugh
Well, I can't get them back
So, I would like another look inside you
I would like to look inside you
Yes, I would love the chance to love you
I would love to love you!

What made me forget everything I know?
All my beliefs replaced by scenarios
Of unintelligent life echoing in stereo
On invisible mics wired into my mind

So, I would like another look inside you
I would like to look inside you
Yes, I would love the chance to love you
I would love to love you

Yes, you
Wherever you are now

I would love the chance to love like I'd never known you
