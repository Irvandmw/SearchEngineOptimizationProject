Lyrics:


It's my time, it's my life
I can do what I like
For the price of a smile
I got a ticket to ride

So I keep living
'Cause it feels right
And it's so nice
And I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better
And I, I, I like how it feels

I like how it feels
I like how it feels
I like how it feels
I like how it feels
I like how it feels

So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes you know
Never stop, give me more, more, more

'Cause I like how it feels
Oh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

Show me love, make us one
Let's make a beautiful world
Take my hand, it's alright
'Cause tonight we can fly

So we keep living
'Cause it feels right
And it's so nice
And I'd do it all again

This time, it's forever
It gets better
And I, I, I like how it feels

I like how it feels
I like how it feels
I like how it feels
I like how it feels
I like how it feels

So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes you know
Never stop, give me more, more, more

'Cause I like how it feels
Oh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

[Pitbull:]
What you consider the best, I consider mediocre
I want my bank accounts like Carlos Slim's or at least a mini-Oprah
Baby just close your eyes and imagine any part in the world, I've been there
I'm like global warming, you think I just started heating things up, but I've been here
I time-travel through time zones
Give me some of my vodka any zone
Enrique Iglesias and translation
Enrique Churches, confession on
Dale mamita, dimelo todo
Alante tu hombre, yo me hago el bobo
No te preocupes, baby for real
Because you gon' like how it feels

'Cause I like how it feels
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

I like how it feels
I like how it feels
