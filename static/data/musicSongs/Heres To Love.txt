Lyrics:


Here's a toast to the most romantic intention
It's that art of the heart most worthy of mention
So pay attention here's to love here's to love
Here's to all that love can stand for
It's a wishful wonderland full just you

Here's to love here's to love
There's a magic touch about it
And you're nothing much without it it's true
It's the feeling lovers swear by whereby they celebrate
Those who find it thereby are feeling only great and lately I kinda sigh when I see you smiling by
Here's this love that's growing
Yes it's love it's showing
Here's to love here's to life with you

[JL]
Here's to love here's to love
That's a thing for jerks and rabbits
Get's you in the darndest habits
It's bad
Here's to love nah love
Makes you feel you're short on plasma
I can feel the same way at asthma except
It's like sweet green sour turning jelly on your moustache
And when it starts you burning
Your wind up just ash in the fireplace
I'd rather sigh over hot corned beef on rye
Who wants love I'm lazy
Who needs love who's crazy
Here's to love here's to life alone

Each (?) night in Paris
Fiesta in San Jose
A handsome treed by Aris
The road to Mandalay
So lately I kinda sigh
When I see you smiling by
Is this love that's growing
Yes it's love it's showing
Here's to love here's to life with you
