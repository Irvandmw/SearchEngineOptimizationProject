Lyrics:


First time I laid eyes on you
I came to understand
What makes a tiny boy
A full grown man

First time I saw the sun go down
I started to believe
There's more between the stars
Than we can see

It went wrong
I search on
To find love
And when I fall I'll climb the walls and fly

Shanghaid in Tokyo Surfing downtown Kokomo
The whole world is spinning as I'm passing thru
Hard rocking in Rio
Hitchhiking down Borneo
Anywhere I go will take me back to you

So I'll keep on travelling
To ease a restless soul
From the shores of Shangri La
To the south pole

I'll sail on the seven seas
I'll trip to outer space
I'll cross any dirty road
To see your face

Love is strong
I search on
To find you
And when I fall I'll climb the walls and fly

Love is here
And love is there
From heaven to the ground
It's in the sun
It's in the rain
It's growing all around
