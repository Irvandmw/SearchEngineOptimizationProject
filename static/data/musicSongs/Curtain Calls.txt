Lyrics:


It's a, a strange thing, just a miracle dream
That being at peace with a fling, what if I more than crushes?
And move than just lust to feeling deep inside
Crying out from my drawers

It's indescribably pushing and my mind is uncertainty
The side I wanna love is uncertain?
Beyond a doubt I want to shout it out
I will shout it out to the world

To find a woman with something
Keeping my whole life to earning
And my baby, what's burning
Decerning, it comes from the heart
That the mind of the eyes
A doctor in containing?
Careful? Collision of hearts

Here we go, you and I
I am me and you are mine
I'ma sing it out, I play it loud
And the curtain calls, baby take a bow
Who knew what, we all want
It's just a simple, situation
I'ma follow my heart
It's lead me well, well I'm here with you today

When I first wet you
I was social and red
I stared like a child
You was faken as death
You smiled and I laughed
And you were asking some questions
But, baby all I was thinking
Was taking first kissing lessons

Blessing seems to be born, from right at the start
You searched me deep down inside just to follow your heart?
I followed it's path, it's leading to you
I was robbed an ex, baby tell me what to do?

Here we go, you and I
I am me and you are mine
I'ma sing it out, I play it loud
And the curtain calls, baby take a bow
Who knew what, we all want
It's just a simple, situation
I'ma follow my heart
It's lead me well, well I'm here with you today

What does it mean to be a perfect match
I love, I love to be so far from perfect
What does it mean to be a perfect catch
I love, I love, I love to love you lady never ever, ever leave me
Believe me I can see we'll be the small seed that grows into the stars
It's a careful? Collision of hearts, yeah

Here we go, you and I
I am me and you are mine
I'ma sing it out, I play it loud
And the curtain calls, baby take a bow
Who knew what, we all want
It's just a simple, situation
I'ma follow my heart
It's lead me well, well I'm here with you today
