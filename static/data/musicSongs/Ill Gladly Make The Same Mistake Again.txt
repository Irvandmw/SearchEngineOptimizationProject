Lyrics:
Lyrics:


There'll be lots of tears plus some happy years
And you'll add my heart to your sovenirs
But loving you was my mistake
But I'll gladly make the same mistake again

I'll be on the town acting like a clown
So they won't suspect that you turned me down
Loving you was my mistake
But I'll gladly make the same mistake again

I've love for you
That's the kind of love that never ever ceases
Break my heart in two or break it into a million little pieces
Every piece you find has you on its mind
If you doubt I'm the forgining kind
All you have to say is when
And I'll gladly make the same mistake again
Yes, I'll gladly make the same mistake again

I've love for you
That's the kind of love that never ever ceases
Break my heart right in two or break it into a million little pieces
Every piece that you find has you on its mind
If you doubt I'm the forgining kind
All you have to say is when
And I'll gladly make the same mistake again
Yes, I'll gladly make the same mistake again
