Lyrics:


No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with, I'm happy on the shelf babe
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm through with flirtin', you that I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
Oh savin' my love oh baby, love for you

Like Jack Horner in a corner
Don't go nowhere and I don't care
Oh your kisses worth waitin' for, babe

I don't stay out late, don't care to go
I'm home about eight, me and my radio, babe
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' all my love for you
