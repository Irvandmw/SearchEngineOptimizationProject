Lyrics:


A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby 

Baby close your eyes and listen to the music
And dig to the summer breeze
It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease

A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby 

Come on baby I'm tired of talking
Grab your coat and let's start walking 
Come on, come on 
Come on, come on 
Come on, come on 
Don't procrastinate, don't articulate
Girl it's getting late, you don't sit and wait around

A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
Satisfy me baby

[Repeating until the end:]
Satisfy me baby
Come on, come on
