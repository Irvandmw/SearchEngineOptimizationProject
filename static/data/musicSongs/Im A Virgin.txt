Lyrics:


Had a lot of girls in my day
Wanted more from me
But there's only really one way
To start a family

And I know you can't believe it's true
But I'm man enough to say to you

I'm a virgin (Uh)
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person (Uh)
Tryna act super tough
But inside I'm a twelve-year old boy

I see you lookin' in a strong way
But I won't give it up
Supermodels, they were all fake
'Cause I never humped
And I know you, I know you want to
But I'm man enough to say to you (Oh)
Underneath the lies and the big talk
I've been waiting for a wife
I never watched porn, never did drugs
'Cause I'm terrified

And I know you 
You can't believe it's true
But I'm man enough to say to you

I'm a virgin (Uh)
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person (Uh)
You wanna hold hands and sign me up
But just know you're not gonna score

I'm a virgin (Uh)
Never got close enough
Pure as a dove, and I'm waiting
For the right person
Never once been touched
The power of God in my loins
