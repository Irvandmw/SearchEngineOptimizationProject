Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I could never miss your love
Warm as a Miami day
I could never get enough
Wetter than an ocean wave

Now one is the key
Two is the door
Three is the path that will lead us to four
Five is the time
You kidnap my mind
Into ecstasy

Lost inside your love, believe me
And if I don't come up then leave me
Inside your love forever

Lost inside your love

When the two of us are one
There's no place I'd rather be oh no
Disappearing in your love
Wilder than my wildest dreams

Now one is the key
Two is the door
Three is the path that will lead us to four
Five is the time
You kidnap my mind
Into ecstasy

Lost inside your love, believe me
And if I don't come up then leave me
Inside your love forever oh no
Lost inside your love

Over and over you know what I mean
Poquito de tu amor, un poquito de tu amor
I see over and over you keep takin' me
A little bit too far, a little bit too deep

Lost inside your love, believe me
And if I don't come up then leave me
Inside your love forever
Inside your love
