Lyrics:


Wasn't really lookin' when you caught my eyes
Just another town, just another night
Didn't say much, I was scared for my life
I didn't catch your number, I didn't know your name
Tried to move on, I couldn't help but think of you
And I knew, that you'd change everything

What's mine is yours
Every breath I take
Every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away
In the blink of an eye, yeah you saved me
You've got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours

Now there's makeup on my counter, your shoes on my floor
Takin' my side of the bed and more
But its fine, I don't mind
Cuz you changed everything

What's mine is yours
Every breath I take
Every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away
In the blink of an eye, yeah you saved me
You've got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah...

Take this ring
Forever now
Til death do us part
Take this vow

What's mine is yours
Every breath I take
Every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away
In the blink of an eye
What's mine is yours
Every breath I take
Every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away
In the blink of an eye, yeah you saved me
You've got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah...
