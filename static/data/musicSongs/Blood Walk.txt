Akademiks music
Suwoo!
Gltt, brra, brra, brra, brr, brr
Let's bang, nigga

Blood walk
They don't really understand how my fuckin' blood talk
Red flag, red Chucks, where the motherfuckin' blood walk?
When you hear "Suwoo", that's the motherfuckin' blood call (suwoo! yeah!)
100K, you can come and book a nigga for a blood walk

Damo Prende motherfuckers
This is that Black Wall Street
That bad-ass motivation
That Nine Trey gangster shit, baby
This is TR3YWAY!

I keep a red flag hangin' out my backside
Only on the right side, yeah, that's the Blood side
And I'm bangin' East-Side
Shoutout to the West-Side, but I'm bangin' Red-Stuy
Nigga, I ran into the blood (to the blood)
I done ran into the cuz (to the cuz)
Get it, cuz, show me love (show me love)
So we both throw it up (ooh)
Suwoo, you gon' hear that (you gon' hear that)
When a nigga "woo", nigga, "woo" back (nigga, "woo" back)
La-di-da-di, love to party (they love to party)
Ayo, Shottie, start the party (boom, boom, boom)

Blood walk
They don't really understand how my fuckin' blood talk
Red flag, red Chucks, where the motherfuckin' blood walk?
When you hear "Suwoo", that's the motherfuckin' blood call (suwoo! yeah!)
100K, you can come and book a nigga for a blood walk
