Lyrics:


Gonna get this party started

It's all around me,
And I can't wish this away,
You so amaze me,
You took my monster away,
It's all around me,
And I can't wish this away,
You so amaze me,
You took my monster away
and away,and away,and away

Wake me, c'mon and wake me up now I
Want to cut off my strings and break,
Loose of your control of me,
Cut your strings and be free with me,
Wake,and wake me up now I want
To cut off my strings and break,loose
Of your control of me,cut your strings
And be free with me

[bridge:]
Everybody, shake your body,
Lift your hands, stop frontin',
You're just a puppet, [x2]

To all the marionettes

[chorus:]
If your gonna run, how fast ya gonna run?,
And If your gonna jump, how high can you jump?,
All you perpetrators be walkin' round frontin',
What?, you fakers afraid to stand for somethin'?
If you're gonna run, how fast ya gonna run?
And if you're gonna jump, how high ya gonna jump?
All the perpetrators be walkin' round frontin'
Why don't you stand up and break me off somethin'?

Ya wanna make it outta sight?,
Somebody wanna get live tonight?,
We can hit that, flip that, settle the score,
'n' ain't nobody rock a crowd like this before,
Ya wanna make it outta sight?,
Somebody wanna get live tonight?,
Like an earthquake, let it shake,
Make the floor vibrate, Krutch y'all,
Back to set the record straight.

All y'all people, listen, it's on,
Krutch marauders we on a mission,
Hittin' ya with the air ammunition,
At war with the puppet master, ..
I'll bring it on if I had to,
Rip it 'n' leave the whole scene shattered,
Like, chik, blaow!, what ya think of me now,
I'm lettin' my dawgs out,
Makin' it loud so hear me shout, what?,
We be comin' laced with bass,
Hit the place with no trace,
When we rock the space,

[bridge]

To all the people still sleepin'

[chorus x2]
