Lyrics:


The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear, 
Are still inside my head! 
The kindest words I'll ever know, 
Are waiting to be said! 

The most entrancing sight of all, 
Is yet for me to see! 
And the dearest love in all the world, 
Is waiting somewhere for me, 
Is waiting somewhere, 

Somewhere for me! 

And the dearest love in all the world, 
Is waiting somewhere for me, 
Is waiting somewhere, 
Somewhere for me!
