[Ariana Grande:]
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey, yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause Iâm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, donât let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause Iâm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

[Mac Miller:]
Baby this a microphone check
What you gettin' into when you get 'em
When I wake up probably I'm gonna text ya
Heard you got a man
Baby I could do it better
And I really ain't complaining
I just want you to remember
How it was, how it is, how it could be
You could put me here, you could push me
Or we can go for a ride, in the sky
Looking up, you're a high
You ain't never gotta lie
Cause it's more than just pussy
For the night everything's alright
When you lay down I'mma hit the lights
If you say so
What's a life if you don't got me
Give you what you want, what you need
What you came for
Hit me up when you're feeling blue
And I tell how I'm feeling too, so you know
I just want to get into you
Right here in the living room
Let's go

[Ariana Grande:]
So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause Iâm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, donât let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause Iâm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

Tell me what you came here for
Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause Iâm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, donât let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause Iâm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
A little dangerous
A little dangerous, my baby
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause Iâm so into you, into you, into you
