Lyrics:


[shotgun cocks twice]

[Cee-Lo]
Iiiiiiiiiii've got a secret
Something I thought maybe I could do
But I can't, now can I?
Lucky - lucky youuuuu!

[Chorus]
Did you know I could be, a would be, killer
If suddenly I should be, I would be, killer

[Cee-Lo]
Hurrrrrt people, hurt people
Thissss is always howwwww
Oh I've been entered by evil
So someone best love me right now!

[Chorus]
Because I could be, a would be, killer
If suddenly I should be, I would be, killer

[Cee-Lo]
Now don't, you, DARE ME
Orrrrr we will DANCE
High up balancing ballet
So I may still get my chaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaance
