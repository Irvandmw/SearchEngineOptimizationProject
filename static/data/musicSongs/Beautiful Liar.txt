Lyrics:


Nobody likes being played

BeyoncÃ©, BeyoncÃ©
Shakira, Shakira

[BeyoncÃ©:]
He said I'm worth it, his one desire
[Shakira:]
I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about
[BeyoncÃ©:]
He kissed me, his one and only (yes), beautiful liar
[Shakira:]
Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about

[Shakira:]
You never know
[BeyoncÃ©:]
Why are we the ones who suffer
[Shakira:]
I have to let go
[BeyoncÃ©:]
He won't be the one to cry

[BeyoncÃ©:]
Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
[Shakira:]
Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

[Shakira:]
I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
[BeyoncÃ©:]
I didn't know about you then 'til I saw you with him again
[Shakira:]
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
[BeyoncÃ©:]
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong

[Shakira:]
We'll never know
[BeyoncÃ©:]
When the pain and heartbreak's over
[Shakira:]
I have to let go
[BeyoncÃ©:]
The innocence is gone

[BeyoncÃ©:]
Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
[Shakira:]
Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

[Shakira:]
Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed
[BeyoncÃ©:]
And I wish I could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
[Both:]
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame

BeyoncÃ©, BeyoncÃ©
Shakira, Shakira
BeyoncÃ©, BeyoncÃ©
Shakira, Shakira

[BeyoncÃ©:]
Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
[Shakira:]
Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar
