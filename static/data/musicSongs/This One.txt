Lyrics:


Like all great romances
What were the chances
You'd miss your train
The schedules had changed
Of all circumstances

You backed into me
A quiet "I'm sorry"
And everything
Just stopped in time
When your eyes met mine

It's gonna be hard to forget this one
This one, but I'll try to, try to
The damage is already done
It's done, so it's time to, time to
'Cause even after days and days and days
You're gone, you're gone
It's gonna be hard to forget this one
This one, but I'll try to

I couldn't hide it
Felt just like flyin'
You drew a heart in the sand
You took my hand
And you pulled me inside it

Yeah, you made me happy
Just lookin' at me
Your dress was soaked
With summer rain
The memories remain

It's gonna be hard to forget this one
This one, but I'll try to, try to
The damage is already done
It's done, so it's time to, time to
'Cause even after days and days and days
You're gone, you're gone
It's gonna be hard to forget this one
This one, but I'll try to

Though it won't end
I'll try again to feel a little better
But under this smile
I know that I'll miss you forever

'Cause even after days, and days, and days
You're gone, you're gone
It's gonna be hard to forget this one
This one, but I'll try to

But I'll try to
