Lyrics:


Are you ready?
Bitch, bitch, bitch I'm Bella Thorne (What? Damn)
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne

I don't need no ID 'cause I'm Bella Thorne
Seen me on TV a million times before
Been inside the club since I was hella short
Now my money talk shit since you can't afford
I don't got a license but I got a Porsche
Yeah, I got some drivers that open my door
Pussy scuba diving, need a surfboard
Let me show my nipples, what I need a shirt for?
Bitch, you need to learn more
I'm only 20 and I'm queen
By the time I'm 23, I'll probably be the king
Every guy that I meet tryna give me a ring
I say "Get down on your knees and eat the whole damn thing"

Back when I feel like it
I just hit low till I book that trip
When I rap is the only time that I spit
Yup, that's some dirty shit B, haha
But I gotta admit
Bitch I'm

Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Work more bitch, bitch, bitch I'm Bella Thorne, what?
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
I should be freaking up but I'm hella bored

Wake up in the morning and I feel so gobby
Look into the mirror and say "I love my body"
Everybody dancin' on me, think that I'm zombie
I do lots of things but none of them are my hobby
One night got some more security in the lobby
'Cause everywhere I go I guarantee paparazzi
I'm not tryna front, you see me riding shawty
So paparazzi, make sure you get good shots of me
I be taking shots on my car, I'm so crazy
I hear MOD SUN, he said "Imma happy baby" (Bella T-)
[?] I piss all in myself
And if I have a wish I'd be like nobody else

Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Wait hold up, hold up, get up in some of my video (bitch I'm Bella Thorne, bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Come on, I'm tryna record over here (bitch I'm Bella Thorne, bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
I don't know how they don't know me!
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Guess bitch

I be back when I feel like it
I just hit low till I book that trip
When I rap is the only time that I spit
That's some dirty shit B
But I gotta with it
Bitch I'm

Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Work more bitch, bitch, bitch I'm Bella Thorne, what?
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch I'm Bella Thorne (bitch I'm Bella Thorne)
I should be freaking up but I'm hella bored

Yes bitch
