Lyrics:


This isn't how the story ends, my friends,
It's just a fork along the road
Don't say your prayers, save your amens,
You've come this far, but you're still far from home
Don't say goodbye, just say farewell
Write every line you'll live to tell
Hold your head high like Harry give 'em hell
As the night ignites the day
Make some memories along the way

Write your song, sing along, love your life
Learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
Start your revolution
And I'll see you at the reunion

Some friends will go and some will stay,
Okay, some last a chapter, some a page
For some love comes disguised as lust
But you'll find love when you find trust one day
Do better than our parents did
Imperfect husband, wife and kids
Go chart your course then turn it upside down
Go live your life eyes open wide
Who's to say what's wrong or right
Right?

Write your song, sing along, love your life
Learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
Start your revolution
And I'll see you at the reunion

Oh-oh

As the night ignites the day
Go make some memories along the way

Write your song, sing along, love your life
Yeah, learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
I say, go start your own revolution
And I'll see you at the reunion

I'll see you at the reunion
Oh, I'll see you at the reunion

This isn't how the story ends, my friends,
It's just a fork along the road
