Lyrics:


Moments I make momentarily mine
At moments, I take a step back in time
Each step that I take is leading me to
A time when I felt upset at you

Moments I gain, moments I lose
I'm just giving time trying to find
What we had once has been left behind
Here we both stand as it slips through our hands

We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall
That comes before pride

Moments we care a little too much
Moments we care are never enough
Clinging to pride, heads held high
What we truly feel, we push to the side

Moments we gained are moments we lose
We're just giving time trying to find
What we had once has been left behind
Yet we stand as it slips through our hands

We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall
That comes before pride
That comes before pride

Are we just giving time trying to find?
What we had once has been left behind
And here we stand as it slips through our hands

We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall
That comes before pride

We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall
That comes before pride

Moments we gained
Are moments, are moments...
Moments we gained
Are moments we lose
