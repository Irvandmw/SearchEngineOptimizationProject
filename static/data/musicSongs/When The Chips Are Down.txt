Lyrics:


Whatcha gonna do when the chips are down
Where you gonna go if all your dreams come tumblin' down
I'd like to know 'cause I still love you so
Will you come runnin' to me when the chips are down

Hey hey hey, whatcha gonna do
Hey hey hey, I'm still here waitin' for you
I'd like to know 'cause I still love you so
Will you come runnin' to me when the chips are down

Hey hey hey, whatcha gonna do
Hey hey hey, I'm still here waitin' for you
I'd like to know 'cause I still love you so
Will you come runnin' to me when the chips are down
When the chips are down
When the chips are down
