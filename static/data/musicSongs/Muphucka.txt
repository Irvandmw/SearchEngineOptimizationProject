Lyrics:


[Hook: Young Scooter]
They check my resume â bet they ainât stayinâ silent
Check my favorite, Chanel and Fendi, all over my body
Ferrari seats ostrich, gorgeous, got that thing squattinâ
Gotta keep that thing â I know these niggas clap
Got that extendo, on that tec, muphucka
Bought a car, got some rims for that muphucka
Copped the spot, put that glass in that muphucka
Just got a house, I paid cash for that muphucka

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
We crucial, got that cannon in this muphucka
You tripped up my cameraman in this muphucka
50-round banana clip on that AK
Nigga play, Iâm goinâ bananas in this muphucka
Ainât nothinâ but bad bitches in my view, muphucka
That nigga tried that niggaâs mind in that muphucka
That boy a mark, that boy Casino in this muphucka
FreeBandz, yeah, my whole gang in this muphucka
We can throw 20 racks on them hatinâ suckers
I see you talkinâ strong, but we got the muscles
Shooters on file, so I ainât gotta hustle
And I ainât gotta say shit, they just know to bust you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mexico Rann]
We in the station straight flexinâ in this muphucka
Scooter, how you get that pound in this muphucka?
You know we got them pistols in this muphucka
I shoulda bought the kitchen in this muphucka
Cook so much dope my mama start bitchinâ
Turned her Sunday kitchen to a fuckinâ dope business
Black amigo niggas known for water whippinâ
We bust them bails down and remix and pivot
Check my resume, I never told nothinâ
Whoever your favorite rapper is, he ainât sold nothinâ
Donât ride Bundts, throw some Forges on that muphucka
You wanna stretch it? Throw some water on that muphucka
