Lyrics:


If I may be so bold could I just say something
Come and make me my day
The clouds around your soul
Don't gather there for nothing
But I can chase them all away

Why d'you need a reason for to feel happy
Or be shining for the rest of the world
Give me just a smile and would you make it snappy
Get your shit together girl

You got a feeling lost inside
It just won't let you go
Your life is sneaking up behind
It just won't let you go
No it just won't let you go
Is what I'm trying to say...

Is would you maybe, come dancing with me
Cos to me it doesn't matter
If your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something you make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth
She knows exactly what she's worth to me!
That I can see, I can see

If you ever find yourself inside a bubble
You've gotta make your own way home
You can call me anytime you're seeing double
Now you know you're not alone

You got a feeling lost inside
It just won't let you go
Your life is sneaking up behind
It just won't let you go
No it just won't let you go
Is what I'm trying to say...

Is would you maybe, come dancing with me
Cos to me it doesn't matter if your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something you make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth

Maybe she'll come dancing with me
Cos to me it doesn't matter
If her hopes and dreams are shattered
When she says something
She'll make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me

Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
Now I see
