Lyrics:


I'm okay, I'm okay,
Kinda being awkward socially
With the fact that the girls
Don't lose their shit when they look at me

It's okay, it's okay,
That I'm not that good at anything
And I don't hit the notes perfectly
When I try to sing

Oh-oh I know I am not alone
So turn the music up and let go

Here's to the rest of us
To all the ones that never felt they were good enough
I wanna hear it for the dazed and confused
The freaks and the losers
Let's put 'em up
Here's to the rest of us
The rest of us

I'm okay, I'm okay
I don't need to be a billionaire
(So freaking bad!)
And my trust fund hopes are looking sad

I confess, I'm a mess
I'm perfectly dysfunctional
But I don't give a damn
If you feel the same
Let me hear you sing

Oh-oh I know I am not alone
So turn the music up and let go

Here's to the rest of us
To all the ones that never felt they were good enough
I wanna hear it for the dazed and confused
The freaks and the losers
Let's put 'em up
Let's put 'em up-up-up

Here's to the rest of us
We do it better than the rich and the fabulous
I wanna hear it for the nothing to lose
With something to prove
Let's put 'em up
Here's to the rest of us

We don't need to apologize for anything
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're who we are
I just wanna hear you sing

Oh-oh I know I am not alone

Here's to the rest of us
To all the ones that never felt they were good enough
I wanna hear it for the dazed and confused
The freaks and the losers
Let's put 'em up
Let's put 'em up-up-up

Here's to the rest of us
We do it better than the rich and the fabulous
I wanna hear it for the nothing to lose
With something to prove
Let's put 'em up
Here's to the rest of us

The lost, the geeks, the rejects, the losers
The wrong, the freaks, the hopeless, the future
The lost, the geeks, the rejects, the losers
The wrong, the freaks, the hopeless, the future
The rest of us
