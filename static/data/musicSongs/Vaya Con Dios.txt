Lyrics:


(now the hacienda's dark, the town is sleeping,
Now the time has come to part,
The time for weeping!)

Vaya con dios, my darling,
May God be with you my love...

Now, the village mission bells are softly ringing,
If you listen with your heart you'll hear them singing (...singing!)
Vaya con dios, my darling,
May God be with you my love...

Where ever you may be, I'll be beside you (...beside you!)

Although you're many million miles away!
Each night I'll say a prayer, a prayer to guide you (...to guide you!)
To hasten every lonely hour of every lonely day...

Now, the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow,
But the memories we share are there to borrow (...no sorrow!)
Vaya con dios, my darling,
May God be with you my love...

Vaya con dios, my darling,
May God be with you my love...

(now the time has come to say goodbye!)
