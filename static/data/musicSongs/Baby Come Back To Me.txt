Lyrics:


Baby, come back to me
Give me one more chance
One more chance to be
To be a better man
This don't have to be
Goodbye
Don't do this to me
Tonight
Just come back to me
Baby, come back to me

Don't make this bed get colder
Don't make me sleep alone
Don't make me burn our picture
Don't make me hate our songs
Don't keep me going crazy
Climbing up these walls
Don't you keep me up all night
Waiting for your call

Baby, come back to me
Give me one more chance
One more chance to be
To be a better man
This don't have to be
Goodbye
Don't do this to me
Tonight
Just come back to me
Baby, come back to me

Don't you go get lonely
Don't put on that dress
Don't go going downtown
Don't go turning heads
Just think about the good times
And everything we had
Don't go throwing that away
I need you so damn bad

Baby, come back to me
Give me one more chance
One more chance to be
To be a better man
This don't have to be
Goodbye
Don't do this to me
Tonight
Just come back to me
Baby, come back to me

Don't make this bed get colder
Don't make me sleep alone

Baby, come back to me
Give me one more chance
One more chance to be
To be a better man
This don't have to be
Goodbye
Don't do this to me
Tonight
Just come back to me
Baby, come back to me

Just come back to me
Yeah, come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
