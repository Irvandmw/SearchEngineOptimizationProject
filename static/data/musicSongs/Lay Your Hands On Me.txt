Lyrics:


They say that to really free your body
You've gotta free your mind
So come on
(Hey, hey, hey)
Check this out (hey)

Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me.

Come on

If you're ready, I'm willing and able
Help me lay my cards out on the table
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking
Right now the rules we made are meant for breaking

What you get ain't always what you see
But satisfaction' is guaranteed
They say what you give is always what you need
If you want me to lay my hands on you

Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me,
All you got to do is
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me,

Now listen up

Lay your hands on me

Well I'm a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a preacher
I've been to school and baby, I've been the teacher
If you show me how to get up off the ground ground ground
I can show you how to fly and never ever come back down

Everything you want is what I need
Your satisfaction is guaranteed
But the ride don't never ever come for free
No no no no
If you want me to lay my hands on you

Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me,
All you got to do is
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me,

[Solo]

Oh, oh, baby, don't you know I only aim to please
If you want me to lay my hands on you

What you got to do is
Lay your hands on me,
Lay 'em on me
Lay your hands on me,
Well, come on, come on, come on
Lay your hands on me,
And everybody gonna help me now

Lay your hands on me,
I know we will be able soon
Lay your hands on me,
I know real my heart turn
Lay your hands on me,
If you wanna baby come on baby come on now

Lay your hands on me
All you gotta do
Lay your hands on me
Remember
Lay your hands on me
Turn around now
Lay your hands on me

Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
