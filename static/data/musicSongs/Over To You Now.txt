Lyrics:


[Spoken]
Do you like this?
This place that Iâm bringing you to?
Because I doâ¦
Oh my Godâ¦.

[Verse 1]
I know this place
Itâs still a secret
And I donât think youâve ever been
Itâs kinda hard
To find the entrance
You need some juice
But youâll love it once you get in
This special place itâs in the basement
You have to work your way around
The place is hot and then itâs pumping
So are you ready to go down?

[Chorus]
So itâs over to you now
So itâs over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And itâs over to you now
Canât you see what Iâm thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If you behave
You might be chosen
Just read the flyer
And it tells you how to get there
And when you come
You might be stunned
So baby whatchu waiting for?

[Chorus]
So itâs over to you now
So itâs over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And itâs over to you now
Canât you see what Iâm thinking-king-king?
So itâs over to you now
So itâs over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And itâs over to you now
Canât you see what Iâm thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Spoken]
Do you like this?
This place that Iâm bringing you to?
Do you feel that? Huh? (Giggles)
Do like that?
I thought you wouldâ¦.
Cause I do.
Oh my God

[Chorus]
So itâs over to you now
So itâs over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And itâs over to you now
Canât you see what Iâm thinking-king-king?
So itâs over to you now
So itâs over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And itâs over to you now
Canât you see what Iâm thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahâ¦..

[Spoken]
Oh my God
