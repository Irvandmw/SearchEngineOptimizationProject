Lyrics:


Ooooohhh
Ooohhhhhh

Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now

Oooooohhh
Oooooohhh

A drug and a dream
A lost connection, oh come back to me
So I can feel alive again
As soul and body try to mend

It's pulling me apart this time
Everything is never-ending
Slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

Oooooohhhh
Ooooooohhh

Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now

Ooooooooo
Oooooohhh
Ooooooooo
Oooooohhh

It's pulling me apart this time
Everything is never-ending
Slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?
