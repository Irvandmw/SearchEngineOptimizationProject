Uhâ¦Fuck it! [laughs]

Iâve been moping around I canât get outta my bed
Iâm so damn tired I canât get outta my head
The only time I smile is when I brush my teeth
The sex last night sucked I woulda rather been asleep

Itâs been a bad, bad day but who gives a shit (Huh?)
I could be sad all day but I donât feel like it (No!)
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEH EH EH..EH EH EH EH EHâ

Itâs two in the morninâ someone tell me whyâs thereâs traffic
I wish I had a bumper car, Iâd road-rage your ass with it
I guess I have a choice I donât have to be this grumpy
âCause thereâs plenty of other losers got it way worse than me

Itâs been a bad, bad day but who gives a shit (Huh?)
I could be sad all day but I donât feel like it (No!)
Itâs been a bad, bad day but who gives a shit (Huh?)
I could be sad all day but I donât feel like it (No!)
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEH EH EH..EH EH EH EH EH EHHH OWWWâ

Coupla deep breaths [breaths]
There I feel better already [breaths]
Couple more [breaths]
Damn what could it be [breaths]
See we should all be happy [breaths]
50 Cent said we could all lick his lollipop,
Heâs gonna take us to the candy shop

I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ

Come with me
Take my hand
Letâs climb some trees
Throw me in the air
Laugh with me (weâll have so much fun)
Smile with me (yay)
Play with me
Canât we all just get along?
Yeah, yeah

Itâs been a bad, bad day but who gives a shit (Huh?)
I could be sad all day but I donât feel like it (No!)
Itâs been a bad, bad day but who gives a shit (Huh?)
I could be sad all day but I donât feel like it (No!)
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEH EH EH..EH EH EH EH EH EHHH OWWW" [SCREAMS]

I feel like âEh eh eh..eh eh eh eh ehâ
I feel like âEH EH EH..EH EH EH EH EH EHHH OWWW" [SCREAMS]
UUUgggghhhhhhhh!!!

Iâm so glad,
Everything is radâ¦everything is rad [laughs]

OOOWWW ROCK AND ROLL!!! [clapping]
