Lyrics:


Heart away
Heart away
Heart away
Heart away

I don't need anybody for nothing
Turned and left me in the cut and now I'm hunting
Heart away
Heart away
Heart away
He took my heart away

He took my heart away, bad man with bad manners
Played me like it was a habit
Middle finger he could have it
I use to dream of living lavish
Now a girl's a living legend
I drown my sorrow in my fashion
If I ain't eating then I'm fasting no
[?]
I couldn't fit it (couldn't fit it)
It didn't work so I gave it to one of my sisters
Had her check in the back of my Benz (real?)
Guess what I did? (what?)
I woke up the next day and packed up my deal
So me and my kids

He took my heart away
Didn't know how to say a prayer, just giving that love away
I had to baller play
He gave my heart away
I been through harder days
Hell no, I was just in LA in my Bentley
Hanging with Stunna, respect
I ain't asking anybody for nothing
Till you left me in the cut and now I'm hunting
Heart away
Heart away
Heart away
He took my heart away
(Heart away)
He took my heart away
(Heart away)
Heart away
(Heart away)
He took my heart away
Heart away
Heart away
(Heart away)
Heart away

[Birdman:]
I got something worth more than money
Go to church, feed the birds on Sundays
So much pain I took you away from it
When I pull up on you I'm stunting
You got a bad man feeling good
Got a rich nigga from the hood
But I ain't never had nuttin like it
Had a few broads or hoes but I ain't like it
Know a nigga want it all
Know I'm shooting for the stars
Know I'm buying all the cars
5 star be the done
Matching cars on the beach
Ball hard and Imma treat ya
Proper plane baby come meet ya
Whole bag of cash when I greet ya
Overseas and we high
Steering wheel the right side
Good girl with the bad guys
I took her heart I won't lie

He took my heart away
Didn't know how to say a prayer, just giving that love away
I had to baller play
He gave my heart away
I been through harder days
Hell no, I was just in LA in my Bentley
Hanging with Stunna, respect
I ain't asking anybody for nothing
Till you left me in the cut and now I'm hunting
Heart away
Heart away
Heart away
He took my heart away
(Heart away)
He took my heart away
(Heart away)
Heart away
(Heart away)
He took my heart away
Heart away
Heart away
(Heart away)
Heart away
