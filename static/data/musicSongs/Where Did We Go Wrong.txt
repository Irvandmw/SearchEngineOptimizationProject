Lyrics:


[Babyface]
For I so loved you girl
That I gave you all my love
With all my heart and soul
I thought you'd always be the one
But you didn't appreciate a single thing I do
You just left me with a broken heart
Didnât you, didnât you?

[Toni]
I tried to tell you baby
Tried to tell you a thousand times
Ooh you wouldnât listen baby
No matter how hard I tried
But you didnât see that I was so in love with you
Then you went to break my heart
Didnât you?

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?

[Babyface]
From the very start
I was so into you
Knew from the beginning I was so so feeling you
But you thought I cheated, that I played around on you
But didnât you do the same, didnât you, didnât you?

[Toni]
Ooh gotta tell you baby
I gotta let you know the deal
Ooh you drew first blood baby
If weâre gonna keep it real
When you cheated, how you hurt my soul
Ooh you broke my heart, didnât you?

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?

[Babyface]
I wish I wouldâve listened
I wish I wouldâve heard

[Toni]
Ooh I wish I wouldâve touched you baby
I wish I wouldâve said the words
That I love you, I love you
I love you
I love you, I love you

[Chorus]
So where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?
