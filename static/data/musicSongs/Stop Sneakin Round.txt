Lyrics:


Well I hear that you've been sneakin' around on me
But honey that's not the way it's gonna be
Well I told you once, and I warned you twice
If you want my love you gotta be nice
And stop that crazy sneakin' around on me

Well let your conscience be your guide you know you're wrong
I'm not gonna take this messin' around to long
When you start cheatin' a love affair
It's not gonna get you anywhere
'Cause one of these days you'll up and find me gone

Well I know somethin' you better find out
Listen to what I've been talkin' about
When you started cheatin' on me
Foolin' around with TNT

Well I hear you've been sneakin' around the place
Somebody is tryin' to lead our love astray
Well I'll tell you somethin' you oughtta know
This messin' around's just gotta go
'Cause one of these days I'll up and walk away

Well I know somethin' you better find out
Listen to what I've been talkin' about
When you started cheatin' on me
Foolin' around with TNT

Well I hear you've been sneakin' around the place
Somebody is tryin' to lead our love astray
Well I'll tell you somethin' you oughtta know
This messin' around's just gotta go
'Cause one of these days I'll up and walk away

Well I hear that you've been sneakin' around on me
Well I hear that you've been sneakin' around on me
Well I hear that you've been sneakin' around on me
