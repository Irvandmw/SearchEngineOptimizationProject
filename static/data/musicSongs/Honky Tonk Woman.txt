Lyrics:


I met a gypsy bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to put me right across her shoulder
Now I can't seem to drink you off my mind

She's a honky tonk woman
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

Sittin' in a bar, tippin' a jar in Jackson
And on the street, the summer sun did shine
There's many a bar-room queen I've had in Jackson
Now I can't seem to drink you off my mind

She's a honky tonk woman
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

I played a divorce in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then all dressed me up in roses
She blew my nose, and then, she blew my mind

She's a honky tonk woman
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

She's a honky tonk woman
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
Said give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
