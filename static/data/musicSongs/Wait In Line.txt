Lyrics:


I can't shake this feeling
At the end o' each day
That I keep on working hard
But all I do is get paid
Though I keep believing
There's a light up ahead
'Cause it's only getting darker
And I could stay in my bed

It's a fight
It takes so long
But I've learned to hold my own

So I stand
And I wait in line
With a heavy head
And this bottle of wine
And I watch
As they steal my time
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line

I walk home in the shadows
I carry my cage
And I hope they notice
What I brought to the stage

'Cause it's a fight
And it takes so long
But I've learned to hold my own

So I stand
And I wait in line
With a heavy head
And this bottle of wine
And I watch
As they steal my time
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line

Ooh whenever it gets inside
It gets so hard to hide
Whenever it gets inside
Ooh I know you'll turn out right
Giving it all my life
I know you'll turn out right

And I stand
And I wait in line
With a heavy head
And this bottle of wine
And I vow
As they steal my time
I know one day I'll get mine
And I stand here and wait in line

I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
