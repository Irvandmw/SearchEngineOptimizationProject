Geekin for the week
You can call me Screech
I can't hear my phone when I'm gone
Hoe quit callin' me
I don't ever trip
Guess that make these niggas fall for me
Bitch, I mind my business
I ain't in it, hoe don't come for me
Yeah, yeah
I'm going hard all week, yeah
Fucked up I can't see, damn
Don't be scared for me, no
This shit what I need, ay
Big ole, big ole, big ole butt
This is sexy, sloppy drunk
Dip the bottle in the cup
Now I'm in here goin' nuts
I don't get hungover, drink Henn' like it's soda
And my man move that work, knock the head right off his shoulder
Shake that ass on your friend, and let her friend join in
And if they really 'bout it, bring 'em both home to your man
Don't fuck with me if you're scary, cos this shit get hit bitch
Tryna get my booty rubbed after the club, who gon text me?

Geekin for the week
Geekin for the week
Geekin-Geekin-Geekin for the week
Geekin for the week, geekin geekin

My best friend a stripper
Big ole booty, walkin' jiggle
And when we ride together
Hoe, you better grab your nigga
Her boyfriend a dealer, he always on duty
We geekin in the traphouse pourin' 40's on her booty
Henny on them titties, and Patron on that pussy
Yeah, you can stay your ass at home if you gon party like a rookie

Bitch I'm geekin for the week
Geekin for the week
Geekin-Geekin-Geekin for the week
Geekin for the week, geekin geekin

Buck on that dick like a bull
I'm goin' to work on your tool
I hang round your neck like a bib
I'm catchin' all of your drool (aah)
My sex appeal on a mil
He call me 'Megan The Meal'
He tellin' you what he want
But he get with me and he will
Windin', grindin' all on your lap
When I look back, know I control that
Goin' left to right, while he holdin' on that
If I move it slow, I bet he won't last

Geekin for the week
Geekin for the week
Geekin-Geekin-Geekin for the week
Geekin for the week, geekin geekin

Overdo it, watch a real bitch come kill shit
Rock lil ass shirts cause my tits big
Turn a grown ass man to a big kid
Pop that, pop that, give him eye contact when I look back
Make his ass lock up like a contract
Talk to him like Mike, nigga, who bad?
Work some, twerk some
See you lookin' at me nigga, like you want some
Got the big boy bottle, let me pour some
Bad bitches, line up if you want some

Geekin for the week
Geekin for the week
Geekin-Geekin-Geekin for the week
Geekin for the week, geekin geekin

Me and my bitch ain't sweatin' no list
Come through the back because they insist
That I, the hottest out now
Come to the stash, turn it to my boudouir
You must ooh ahh, when they see me
Young Tina Snow, H-Town hottie
Long ass legs like I'm Naomi
He reaching for my pussy, tryna Donald Trump me
I hang on your chin like a damn goatee
I make him go to sleep like I'm Lei Ali
Your hoe couldn't make one of me
And none of y'all hoes can't hang where I be

Geekin for the week
Geekin for the week
Geekin-Geekin-Geekin for the week
Geekin for the week, geekin geekin

Geekin for the week
You can call me Screech
I can't hear my phone when I'm gone
Hoe quit callin' me
I don't ever trip
Guess that make these niggas fall for me
Bitch, I mind my business
I ain't in it, hoe don't come for me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
