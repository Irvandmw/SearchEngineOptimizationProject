Lyrics:


This is a story of how it is 

Lovin' every morning
Good loving every night
That is what I gave you,
And you were so satisfied
Dinner on the table
There were flowers in the bed
Anything you asked for
Was it all real or just in my head? 

Think now, of what it should've been
Our love, all it could've been
If you were ever wondering
I'm doin' fine, but in my mind 

I could never believe and never understand
How you could do this to me
Enough is enough, done all I can
Now you're gonna lose me
Throwing away our yesterdays
Everything we planned
Cause you're a girl, I'll never understand 

How you feelin now?
Are you happy now?
I'm doing just fine 

Covered you in diamonds
Gave you summer in the sun
And at that moment I had only just begun
Got you the designers
From every magazine
Baby if I'd known then
All this pain inside would never be 

Girl, you are a mystery
So glad, that we're history
Guess we were never meant to be
And I'm doin' fine, but in my mind 

I could never believe and never understand
How you could do this to me
Enough is enough, done all I can
Now you're gonna lose me
Throwing away our yesterdays
Everything we planned
Cause you're a girl, I'll never understand  

Are you happy now baby?
That we're history
Yeah, yeah 

Think now, of what it should've been
Our love, all it could've been
If you were ever wondering
I'm doin' fine, but in my mind 

I'm just throwing away our yesterdays
Giving it up on the plans we made
Enough is enough, done all I can
This girl I'll never understand
I could never believe, never understand
How you could do this to me
Enough is enough, done all I can
Now you're gonna lose me
Throwing away our yesterday's
Everything we planned
Cause you're a girl, I'll never understand
