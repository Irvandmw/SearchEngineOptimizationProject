Lyrics:


Metro Boomin make it boom
Aye, Metro Boomin make it boom, make it boom

Don't be telling me you're through
'Cause I be thinking that it's true, that it's true
Telling me about your new boo
And I don't wanna face the truth, if it's true
I just wanna get to you
Anything to get to you, get to you
I just wanna get to you
Anything to get to you, get to you

I always had you in some new 'Loubs
Never let you complain about your shoes, bought you shoes
When nobody would listen to me
I know that I can talk to you, talk to you
'Cause everybody else is clueless, no excuses
Keep on saying they gon' do shit, never do shit
She keep saying she gon' use me, I'ma use her
I got on so many jewels, I feel like a jeweler
I pulled up in a Patek, you pulled up in a Mueller
Double wedding band ring, she pulled off in a new fur
Metro Boomin on the beat, I feel like I'm cheating
Showing me that nipple ring, I feel like you teasing
You keep begging me to eat, girl why you beasting?
Can I take you to my suite?
Yeah, for a weekend
Can you come and give me brain?
Make me a genius
I could make that pussy beatbox while I'm singing

But when you tell me you're through
I start to think that shit is true, is it true?
Telling me about your new boo
And I don't wanna face the truth, if it's true
I just wanna get to you
Anything to get to you, get to you
I just wanna get to you
Anything to get to you, get to you
I just wanna get to

I need to care to you, carefully, carefully
I'm moving carefully
Iggin' me, iggin' me
It don't make sense to me
Send for me, send for me
Need you to win for me
Care for me, care for me
And if you care, make time for me, make time for me
And when you lie to me it just be killing me
You're acting differently, I need to care to you
I need you there for me, I need to care to you
I need to care to you, carefully, carefully
I'm moving carefully
Iggin' me, iggin' me
It don't make sense to me
Send for me, send for me
Need you to win for me
Care for me, care for me
And if you care, make time for me, make time for me
And when you lie to me it just be killing me
You're acting differently, I need to care to you
I need you there for me

[Future:] If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
