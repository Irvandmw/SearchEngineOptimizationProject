Lyrics:


Light
It falls from you and covers me
And I
I love you in ways no voice could speak
I never dreamed Iâd have so much
But Iâd burn it all just to warm you up

You are the water that I drink
You are the song Iâll always sing
You turned my world of doubt into belief
And I will love you on your way
I will remember every day
And if you fall Iâm never out of reach
Cause youâre a part of me

Live
May the wind carry you
And rise
High enough to see the truth
I will protect you when I can
Donât be afraid just give me your hand

[Chorus]

As you go along
You wonât take a step alone
And should your faith be gone
Iâll believe for you

I love you more than the sea is deep
Just know (that) you can always count on me

[Chorus]
