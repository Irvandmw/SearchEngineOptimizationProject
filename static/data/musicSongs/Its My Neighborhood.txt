Lyrics:


Don't get too close to me,
don't overreact,
you're not the enemy as a matter of fact,
you got your pretty face and you got any name you wore
gonna stick by you, gonna stumble over what to do.

I want it, good lovin' wanna be your plaything.
I want it, good lovin' bring out the beast in me.
I want it, good lovin' wanna make your heart sing,
in the shadows we are free, and I walk you through it.

It's my neighborhood,
that's where I belong.
You're in trouble if you
disagree with me.
It's my neighborhood,
that's where I belong,
you find out why.

It's my neighborhood,
that's where I belong.
You're in trouble if you
disagree with me.
It's my neighborhood,
that's where I belong,
you find out why.

So many tell you that you can't win
It's a battle if you're lonely
Or if you're starting over
Two-fisted and fast on your feet
And you know there's something more
And the city kicks it out of you and...

I want it, good lovin' wanna be your plaything.
I want it, good lovin' bring out the worst in me.
I want it, good lovin' wanna make your heart sing,
in the shadows we are free, and I walk you through it.

It's my neighborhood,
that's where I belong.
You're in trouble if you
disagree with me.
It's my neighborhood,
that's where I belong,
you find out why.
