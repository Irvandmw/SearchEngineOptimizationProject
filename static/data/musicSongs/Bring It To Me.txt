Lyrics:


Seven days, seven nights
I've not tasted your delight
Sing my song, make me long for your
For your gordly stung love bites
Feed me this, feed me that
Put your finger on my map
Ride my seas, kiss me please
Can you find my honey trap?

Bring me jewels
Bring me fools
Bring me rhythm, soul, and blues
Feed me this, feed me that
Bring me nothing less than you

Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
While you seduce me
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
But bring it loosely

Bring me joy, bring me freedom
Bring the world so we can feed 'em
Bring me peace, bring relief
Drop your arms, 'cause we don't need 'em
Bring me hugs, bring me love
Bring me seventeen white doves
Ride my seas, kiss me please
Bring me all the stars above

[2x]
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
While you seduce me
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
But bring it loosely

Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
She's living loosely
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
Bring it to me on a plate
While you seduce me
