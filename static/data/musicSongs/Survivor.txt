Lyrics:


[Intro - Mavado (Akon)]
Aye, (yeah!)
Anyway, (ohh!)
Gangster for life, (Akon!)
Pray for my enemies don't pray for me, (yeah!)
We da best, (ganster for life)

[Hook - Mavado]
Oh the street is like a fire, (like a fire)
Show no sympathy, (oh no)
I'll be way up on the mountain, (on the mountain)
When they come for me, (yeah yeah)
Cause I'm a survivor, survivor,
I'm a survivor, Oh Ohh,
Cause I'm a survivor, survivor,
I'm a survivor, Oh Ohh,

[Verse 1 - Mavado]
When my enemies surround me,
Nothing me no fear,
Cause them know which part to find me,
I am like a flare,
Mama know them want to kill me,
Tell me how them ago see me,
Anuh now them want to kill me,
Who cares,
As God is my provider,
Everyday I get wiser,
I live by the sword,

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Akon]
Seems there is no sympathy,
Or no mercy for the weak,
Won't surrender, no retreat,
I'll make you remember me,
And for those who want to kill me,
Know exactly where to find me,
Down in the concrete jungle,
If I don't kill you first,
Then please don't tempt me,
[gunshot sound]
A hundred miles and running,
Never back down on an outlaw coming,
[gunshot sound]
Artillery looks stunning,
M-16 torque gunning.

[Mavado]
Cause I'm a survivor, survivor,
I'm a survivor, Oh oh,
Cause I'm a survivor, survivor,
I'm a survivor, Oh Oh,

[Verse 3 - Mavado]
I'm so high up on the mountain,
Can't find my way back down,
Watch me flow just like a fountain,
Solid as a ground,
Once you go up,
Then you nuh fi come down,
Revolution time, Revolution sound,
We da Best,
A the talk of the town,
Forget the rest,
A the talk of the town,
All who want to kill me,
Tell them me care zero,
Cause I'm a champion,
I'm a hero.

[Hook]
Cause I'm a survivor, survivor,
I'm a survivor, Oh oh,
Cause I'm a survivor, survivor,
I'm a survivor, Oh Oh,
[gunshot sound]
