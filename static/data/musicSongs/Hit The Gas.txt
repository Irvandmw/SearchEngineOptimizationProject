Lyrics:


The first day we met I was 17
The sky was shining bright
And the grass was green
You had your hair up
A smile on your face
I'll never forget that day

You walked up to me and
Asked for a ride
I had a buddy in the front
So I pushed him aside
Put your seatbelt on
Throw your feet on the dash
Said boy please try not to crash
Then I winked back said baby
Don't you trust me?

Then I hit the gas
I just wanna go fast
I want this feeling to last
So I hit the gas
If you wanna go back
Baby its too late for that
I hit the gas

We pulled in about 10 past 12
I dropped you off
Ya daddy gave me hell
You threw your hands up
Gave me a grin
You jumped back in
Said lets do it again

Then I hit the gas
I just wanna go fast
I want this feeling to last
So I hit the gas
If you wanna go back
Baby its too late for that
I hit the gas

I know you're just a small town girl
Just give me a chance and I'll show
You the world
So come on baby
Mmmmmmm
I just wanna go fast
So I hit the gas
