Lyrics:


There were places we would go at midnight
There are secrets left nobody else would know
There's a reason but
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I thought they all belong to me

[CHORUS]
Who's that girl?
Where's she from?
No, she can't be the one
That you want
That has stolen my world
It's not real
It's not right
It's my day
It's my night
By the way, who's that girl?
Living my life

Oh, no
Living my life

Seems like everything's the same around here
When I look again and everything has changed
I'm not dreaming so
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
She's everywhere I wanna be

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I'm the one
Who made you laugh
Who made feel
I made you sad
I'm not sorry
For what we did
Who we were
I'm not sorry
I'm not hurt

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Oh, no
Living my life
