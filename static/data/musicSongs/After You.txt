Lyrics:


Is this all we get? One short life
Tell me we got time
I saw a world without you there
Somehow you weren't mine

And, oh
Please don't go
Please don't go
And leave me alone

Don't wanna give my heart to someone new
Won't be anybody after you
And even if one day our time is through
Won't be anybody after you, after you
I'll never find another lover after you

If you have to go
Be my ghost
Hope you haunt my dreams
So I won't be alone
'Cause I'd give up hope
If you weren't there for me

And, oh
Please don't go
Please don't go
And leave me alone

Don't wanna give my heart to someone new
Won't be anybody after you
And even if one day our time is through
Won't be anybody after you, after you
I'll never find another lover after you

I won't be able to move on, baby
I won't be able to love nobody else
So if you go, won't you take me with you?
Don't leave me alone

I don't wanna give my heart to someone new
There won't be anybody after you
And even if one day our time is through
Oh, won't be anybody after you, after you
After you
I'll never find another lover after you
