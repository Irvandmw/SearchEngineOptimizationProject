Lyrics:


I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed

The lights were a-flashin'
And tongues were a-waggin'
Over you
It's too late for tryin'
It's too late for denyin'
All those little things
You and me have done
I'm sorry, hon'
I was hopin' for a recall
A mix of you high from the sun
Oh, but nothin'
Only lone magpies come

I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed
