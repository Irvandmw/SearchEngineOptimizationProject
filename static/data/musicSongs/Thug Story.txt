Lyrics:


[T-Pain:]
Hey hey, T-Swizzle T-Swizzle
And T-Pizzle T-Pizzle

[Taylor Swift:]
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug

I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[T-Pain and Taylor:]
I had a dream last night

[Taylor Swift:]
I had high-top Nikes
I had

[T-Pain and Taylor:]
Diamonds in my mouth
And diamonds on my mic

[Taylor Swift:]
By the time I woke I was singing

[T-Pain:]
I'm on a boat

[Taylor Swift:]
'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper

[T-Pain:]
Shorty I'm a make ya

[Taylor Swift:]
Straight to the top, yo

[T-Pain:]
Shorty I'm a take ya

[Taylor Swift:]
You can call me T-Sweezy
Now I'm a rap star

[T-Pain:]
Hey, it's a thug story
Now tell 'em who you are
Singer turned gangster

[Taylor Swift:]
You don't wanna fight me

[T-Pain:]
Straight to the top

[Taylor Swift:]
In my extra small white tee

[T-Pain:]
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story now can you get with that?

[Taylor Swift (T-Pain):]
What, what, I knit sweaters, yo!
What, what, don't test me
Hey, hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything
I didn't even sâ
(What?)
I said, "Yo."
(Yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear
(She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!
