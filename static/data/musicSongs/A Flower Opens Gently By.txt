Artist: Ricky Nelson Lyrics
Song Name: A Flower Opens Gently By
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Feeling crowded sidewalks burn
And lonely couples never learn
Paying tributes to our dead
With empty words we never said
Goodbye, so long

Spilling time at every turn
Living lives of no return
As stately figures compromise
A flower opens gently by
Goodbye, so long

Like fearless barks of frightened dogs
We hide behind some worthy cause
AS anger starts it's empty rise
A flower opens gently by
Goodbye, so long

It hurts so bad to lose a friend
There's a valley where the river's been
While all you wingless birdmen try to fly
A flower closes gently by
Goodbye, so long
Bye bye, so long
