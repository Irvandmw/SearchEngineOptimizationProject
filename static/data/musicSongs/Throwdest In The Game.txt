Lyrics:


(Yung L.A. - Ain't I mix)

[Hook:]
Ain't I [x6]
You know I is
Ain't I off the chain
Ain't I such a pain
Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I known for spitting flames
Ain't I [x6]
You know my name
Ain't I getting change
Ain't I on them swangs
Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Throwdest In The Game

[Verse 1:]
Let's Go
Ay
I move a million tapes before my label even ship me
That's the reason that my donuts like a box of chip-lees
I wish I wish an idiot act up and try to diss me
Like that you ? class I used to pay you goin be history
When I leave rap, I know the rap world is gonna miss me
I heard a little busta wanna sue me youse a sissy
They say that it ain't tricking if you got it, but that's tricky
I think the person that made up that slogan try'na trick me
The game cost a fee and I can't say that I'm affordable
If she out of town then my pimpin game is portable
Got some haters on the sac, the plan was just ignoring you
But now you starting to be a pest, I gotta call a auto-bull

[Hook:]
Ain't I [x6]
You know I is
Ain't I off the chain
Ain't I such a pain
Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I known for spitting flames
Ain't I [x6]
You know my name
Ain't I getting change
Ain't I on them swangs
Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Throwdest In The Game

[Verse 2:]
Yeah your shirt is ro-ho, you ain't a blood boy you fake
Put my knuckles on your face, so that in your shirt can cordonate
I'm already legendary y'all know that I'm more than great
Way before I got revenge you just saw it sorta late
Windows in my living room, toss it they just gonna say
They don't have enough fabric, I didn't even order drapes
Mixtape God you can hear the scriptures on my tapes
Got chicks in Atlanta offering me money more than Mase
Do whatever that I tell em never insupportate
Girl you looking super fine I know you gotta gorgoeus face
Tape some money to ya head and you da chick I'm gonna date
But soon as ya fall asleep and you know what I'm gonna take
Get Money

[Hook:]
Ain't I [x6]
You know I is
Ain't I off the chain
Ain't I such a pain
Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I known for spitting flames
Ain't I [x6]
You know my name
Ain't I getting change
Ain't I on them swangs
Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Ain't I Throwdest In The Game
