Lyrics:


We're heading out to where the sun goes down
Watch these wheels go around
Ain't looking back, we've done the best way we could
We've come a long, long way
It's so far so good

Their ain't a river that can't be rode
Ain't no cowboy that can't be thrown
Pick some lessons, yeah, we had our share
Not sure where we're going
But we're gonna get there

So far, so good
We're gonna make it, knock on wood
So far, so good
We got the engine under the hood

So far, so good
We're going to get there
At least we're sure
Yeah, so far, so good, alright

Wild, wild horses couldn't hold us back
Nothing can stop us, yeah, we're on the right track
When the cold wind blows and it's winter time
We're heading South, baby, soak up the sunshine

So far, so good
We're gonna make it, knock on wood
So far, so good
We got the engine under the hood

So far, so good
We're going to get there
At least we're sure
Yeah, so far, so good

So far, so good
We're gonna make it, knock on wood
So far, so good
We got the engine under the hood

So far, so good
So far, so good
So far, so good
So far, so good
Knock on wood

So far, so good
