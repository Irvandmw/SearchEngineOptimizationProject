Lyrics:


I didn't do nothin', what are ya talkin' about
I don't care who said so, but since you spitted it out
I never touched her, that's a dirty lie
You don't smell no perfume, I wouldn't even try

Don't look at me with those sad eyes
Don't look at me
Don't look at me with those sad eyes
There's nothin' to see

She don't do nothin' for me, she never has
Think about the future, forget about the past
Livin' ain't so easy, and nothin's ever free
You got the whole world to fight with, you shouldn't fight with me

Don't look at me with those sad eyes
Don't look at me
Don't look at me with those sad eyes
There's nothin' to see

Believe me, baby please
Jealousy is a disease

Don't look at me with those sad eyes
Don't look at me
Don't look at me with those sad eyes
There's nothin' to see

Believe me, baby please
Jealousy is a disease

Don't look at me
Don't look at me
Don't look at me...
