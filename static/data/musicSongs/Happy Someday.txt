Lyrics:


It's just another old Sunday
A few more hours 'til it's Monday
The weekend's almost over
I feel myself gettin' older
It's becoming more and more apparent
I'm turning out like my parents
I hate going to bed early
But I gotta go work for a man who doesn't know my name
Makes me wear a uniform so everybody looks the same
But I can't be late
I've got those credit card bills I gotta pay

Hey hey hey, I'm gonna be happy someday

Then finally it's Friday
I'm thinkin' life's goin' my way
But there's nothing to do
Guess I'll hang out with my friends and I know
We'll end up at a show
Where they'll drink away the dreams they gave up long ago
But I can't complain, 'cause I've been right there doin' the same

Someday I'll be happy
Will someone tell me when will that be?
Somewhere I lost track of what's right
And now I'm stuck on the sidelines
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Not gonna take it any longer
It's time to take back control of my life

Someday I'll have everything
I'll get paid money just to sing
A new car, and a big house
A few kids running around
I'm gonna marry my girlfriend
And fall in love all over again
Someday I'll have it all
