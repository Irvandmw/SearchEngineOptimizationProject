Lyrics:


If I told you, how I feel inside, 
Would you understand the love I'm feelin' 
Would you run away and hide? 

I do, love you, 
And I always will, 
Love's not a word I've often spoken, 
You make my restless heart stand still! 

You are my world, my newborn soul, 
Here is my heart for you to hold, 
You're every dream of love come true, 
Yes, everything I'll ever need is you! 

(I will...) I will... (love you...) love you... 

(Like no one before...) 
An' should you ever ask how much I love you, 
I'd say I couldn't love you more! 

'Cause you're my world, my newborn soul, 
Here is my heart for you to hold, 
You're every dream of love come true, 
Yes, everything I'll ever need is you! 

(You're every dream of love come true...) 
Yes, everything I'll ever need is you!
