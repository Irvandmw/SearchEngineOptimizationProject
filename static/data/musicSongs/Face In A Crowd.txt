Artist: Dean Martin Lyrics
Song Name: Face In A Crowd
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I search each face in a crowd looking for you
Just a hoping to see you again
Those laughing eyes and tender lips that used to thrill me
So I search every face in a crowd
No matter where that I go I keep on staring
For the face that belongs to you
Just looking for the favorite color you're always wearing
So I search every face in a crowd
I know I've said that I didn't need you
Every day every night oh how I failed
But I'll keep hoping someday I'm gonna find you
Some lucky minute some happy hour some lucky day
So I'll search every face until I'll find you
I didn't know that I'd miss you this way
I hope I'm not too late because I love you
So I search every face in a crowd
So I search every face in a crowd
