[Chris Brown:]
There can be one only you
And, baby, God could never make two
And I know you came here with your crew
But I promise you that it feels like it's just us two, aha.

Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
But I just wanna be the one to do you right, right
And we're standing here looking at each other, baby, eye to eye
And I'm hoping that you're thinking about leaving with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they're wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my baby
Love me, love you crazy
Tell me if you're ready
Baby, come and get it
Try a new thing
Usher baby
And let's spark a new flame
Crazy let me holla at it
Yeah, man

[Usher:]
I can't believe you came here all alone, baby girl, where's your lover?
Oh, it don't really matter 'cause I got plans to get to know you better,
Baby, baby, baby, baby, let's make what we got here last forever
Girl, 'cause I don't wanna let you go, never

[Chris Brown:]
Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
Girl, I just wanna be the one to do you right, right
And we're standing here looking at each other, baby, eye to eye
Baby, I hope that you're thinking about leaving with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they're wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my, baby
Love me, love you crazy
Tell me if you're ready
Baby, come and get it
Try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
(You know what time it is, Chris)

[Rick Ross:]
Homeplate, world series, how a nigga sliding in her
Baby, I'm a boss, I'm talking George Steinbrenner
Panamera, Yogi Berra, my two-seater Derek Jeter
Got more stripes than all these niggas
Babe Ruth balling in a Beamer
Collar on my Polo, kisses on my necklace
All my diamonds watching, now my watches getting jealous
Smoking on a bomb in my autograph LeBrons
Yeah, she told me I'm the one,
That's when I only hit it once

[Chris Brown:]
Maybach music
Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they're wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my baby
Love me, love you crazy
Tell me if you're ready
Baby, come and get it
Try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
