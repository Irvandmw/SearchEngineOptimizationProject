Lyrics:


Adios, aloha, hasta luego, and buenas noches to you
Adios, aloha, hasta luego, and buenas noches to you

You said au revoir, ma te chÃ©rie
Which means that youâre leaving me
(I guess)
Well, comme bon toi Ã  moi sont, yes
I tell you to get along
Iâm finally getting out of this mess
And thatâs not all I got to say

Adios, aloha, hasta luego, and buenas noches to you
Adios, aloha, hasta luego, and buenas noches to you

You said j'ai l'intention de partir demain
Which means youâre leaving right away
(OlÃ©)
Well, câest la vie, thatâs life
I didnât want to be your wife
I didnât love you anyway
And thatâs not all I got to say

Adios, aloha, hasta luego, and buenas noches to you
Adios, aloha, hasta luego, and buenas noches to you
Adios, aloha, hasta luego, and buenas noches to you
