Lyrics:


Don't know what to say to you now
Standing right in front of you
Don't know how to fade in and out
Don't know how to play it cool
Lose a little guard, let it down
We don't have to think it through
We've got to let go

I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love

Tried to call you to feel you close
From a runway in Tokyo
Let's leave the atmosphere, disappear
There's always something left to lose

But I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
I wanna give you wild love

(Love, love, love)
(Love, love, love)
I wanna give you wild love
(Love, love, love)
I wanna give you wild love
(Love, love, love)

Let's be reckless, unaffected
Running out until we're breathless
Let's be hopeful, don't get broken
Let's stay caught up in the moment

I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
I wanna say I wanna give you wild love
Give you wild love
Wild love
Wild love
Wild love
