Lyrics:


Across the border they turn 
Water into wine 
Some say it's the devil's blood 
They're squeezing from the vine 
Some say it's a saviour 
In these hard and desperate times 
You see it helps me to forget
That we're just born to die 

I came here like so many did 
To find a better life
To find my piece of easy street 
And finally be alive
I knew nothing good comes easy
All good things take some time
I made my bed I'll lie in it 
To die in it's the crime 

You can't help but prosper 
Where the streets are paved with gold 
They say the oil wells ran deeper here 
Than anybody's known 
Now I packed up on my wife and kid
And left them both back home
See there's nothing in this paydirt
The ghosts are all I know 

Now the oil's gone 
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hangin' on 

Down in dry county 
They're swimming in the sand 
Praying for some holy water 
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry 
Where nobody cries 
And no one's getting out of here alive 

Not this time

In the blessed name of Jesus 
I heard a preacher say 
We are all God's children 
That He'd be back, back someday 
Hoped that he knew 
Something as he drank his cup of wine 
I didn't have too good a feeling 
As I head out to the night 

I cursed the sky to open 
I begged the clouds for rain 
I prayed all night for water 
For this burning in my veins 

It was like my soul's on fire 
And I had to watch the flames 
Well, my dreams went up in ashes 
And my future blew away 

Now the oil's gone 
And the money's gone 
All the jobs are gone 
Still we're hangin' on 

Down in dry county 
They're swimming in the sand 
Praying for some holy water 
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry 
Where nobody cries 
And no one's getting out of here alive 

Man spends his whole life
Waiting praying for some big reward
But it seems sometimes 
The payoff leaves you feeling 
Like a dirty whore 
If I could choose the way I'd die 
Make it by the gun or knife 
'Cause the other way there's too much pain 
Night after night after night after night

Down in dry county 
Where they're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water 
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry 
Where nobody cries 
And no one's getting out of here
Dry county
No one's getting out of here
Dry county. No
