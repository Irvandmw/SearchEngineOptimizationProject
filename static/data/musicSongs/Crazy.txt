Fuck round, fuck round, fuck round, fuck round

Tryna show this game up
Fuck round piss your self off
Tryna make me jealous
You know you a good guy
We know I'm the hot girl
Fuck round get your heart broke
Acting outta character
Aye, you know I'm addicted to hustling
You know I'm a get it by any means
You fell in love with the lifestyle
Now you gotta keep up with me
Aye, he know I do what I want
I know that drive him so crazy
Get caught in the moment and ask if it's his
Then I look back and say "Maybe"
You know he fell in love with the lingo
Keep my name low in his mouth like Bingo
Told him he can get it then he took it like a repo
Got that nigga under controller
I got the cheat code
Aye, he so addicted to me
Fell in my trap
Now that dick stick to me
I had it first they can get after me
But who the fuck else get it right after me?

I knew right when we start talking might not talk again
You got way too many problems
Way too many friends
You got way too many issues
Way too many moves
I got way too much experience with these type of dudes

I'm gon' fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round, fuck round, fuck round, fuck round
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round, fuck round, fuck round, fuck roud

Aye, he so addicted to me
Fell in my trap
Now that dick stick to me
I had it first they can get after me
But who the fuck else get it right after me?

Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round, fuck round, fuck round, fuck round

Sip champagne get membrane
Go slow yeah that make me go insane
And I can tell what he thinking like a twin thing
And they can never understand it cause that's our thing
Got moves like a tarantula
Get up in my web I'm a snatch you up
Long ass legs I can wrap you up
And now I got you in ya bag like a sack of lunch
You know I want you don't need you
Really I just came to feed you
I hop on that face and stampede you
And then I start over like redo
We need a we need a redo
I give you some time to redeem you
You know I ain't scared I'm a freak too
And really I really I could teach you
He like the way I smell
He like the way I slick my bun down with the gel
He like it when I get up in that suit, dress well
He like it when I throw it to the side, give em hell
He like it when I'm out here getting money I can tell
He wanna beat down so bad I can tell
And he don't want nobody else to get it, I can tell
And he know anybody after Megan is an L

I knew right when we start talking might not talk again
You got way too many problems
Way too many friends
You got way too many issues
Way too many moves
I got way too much experience with these type of dudes

I'm gon' fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round, fuck round, fuck round, fuck round
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round, fuck round, fuck round, fuck round

Aye, he so addicted to me
Fell in my trap
Now that dick stick to me
I had it first they can get after me
But who the fuck else get it right after me?

Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round drive you crazy
Fuck round, fuck round, fuck round, fuck round

This one's for my playa ass women
Who getting money and ain't getting in they feelings
Who making profit, digging in these niggas wallets
My pretty women hanging with their pretty partners
