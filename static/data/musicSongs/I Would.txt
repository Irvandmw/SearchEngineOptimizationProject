Lyrics:


If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way
So you could see a better day
Baby, I would, baby, I would

I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV
Run away to a hideaway, we'd be living the American Dream

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way
So you could see a better day
Baby, I would, baby, I would
Just to hear you say

Baby, I would

I would build the love a river wide
So that it never runs dry
Anytime you ask me why
I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied

You got your flaws and so do I
Past lovers that made you cry
And though I wanna make it right
I just can't read your mind, no

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try

If I could take away the pain oh no
And put a smile on your face
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way
So you could see a better day, no
Baby, I would, baby, I would
Just to hear you say

Baby, I would

Yeah, it's not about what I want
It's all about what you need
I know that he hurt you
But that wasn't me
And I know, and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That I'm where you need to be

If I could take away the pain oh no
And put a smile on your face
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way
So you could see a better day, no
Baby, I would, baby, I would

Baby, I would
