Lyrics:


Who's that girl?, Who's that girl?

When you see her, say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble, in a word get closer to the fire
Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can't

[Chorus:]
Â¿QuiÃ©n es esa niÃ±a?, Who's that girl?
SeÃ±orita, mas fina, Who's that girl?
Â¿QuiÃ©n es esa niÃ±a?, Who's that girl?
SeÃ±orita, mas fina, Who's that girl?

You try to avoid her, fate is in your hands
She's smiling, an invitation to the dance
Her heart is on the street, tu corazÃ³n es suyo
Now you're falling at her feet
You try to get away but you can't

[Chorus]

[Intermediate:]
Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now

Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
He's spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can't

[Chorus]
[Intermediate]

Who's that girl?
Now, Who's that girl?
Now, Who's that girl?
Now, Who's that girl?

[Chorus]
