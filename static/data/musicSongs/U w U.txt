(Oh yeah, oh yeah...)

You're so uwu (ooh)
You make me wanna do (oh baby)
Naughty things to you (naughty things)
All these things to you (all these things)
Cause baby you're so uwu
You make me wanna do
Naughty things to you
All these things to you
Cause baby you're so...

I wanna do, do, do, the naughty things to you, to you, to you, to you
I wanna do, do, do, the naughty things to you, to you, to you, to you

We been on the phone for like hours can I pull up in
Before we doze off and
Can't take them clothes off and
You been in your bag, you can't lie, let me show off it
I feel so selfish, because them hoes want it
You know you're cute right?
So nice, [?], she back to take two flights?
Off for the coochie and you know it too that the cooch tight
Cute as a button, undoing the buttons and pushing your buttons I
Just want to get you right

You're so uwu (ooh)
You make me wanna do (oh baby)
Naughty things to you (naughty things)
All these things to you (all these things)
Cause baby you're so uwu
You make me wanna do
Naughty things to you
All these things to you
Cause baby you're so...

I wanna do, do, do, the naughty things to you, to you, to you, to you
I wanna do, do, do, the naughty things to you, to you, to you, to you
I wanna do, do, do, the naughty things to you, to you, to you, to you
I wanna do, do, do, the naughty things to you, to you, to you, to you
