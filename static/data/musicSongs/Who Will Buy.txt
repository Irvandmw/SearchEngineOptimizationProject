Lyrics:


Who will buy this wonderful morning
Such a sky you never did see
Who will tie it up with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me

So I can see at my leisure
Whenever things go wrong
And I can keep it as a treasure
To last my whole life long

Who will buy this wonderful feeling
I'm so high, I swear I could fly
Me oh my, I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do, to keep the sky so blue
There must be someone who will buy

Who will buy this wonderful morning
Such a sky you never did see
Who will tie it up with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me

They'll never be a day so sunny
It could not happen twice
Where is a man with all the money
It's cheap at half the price

Who will buy this wonderful feeling
I'm so high, I swear I could fly
Me oh my, I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do, to keep the sky so blue
There must be someone who will buy
