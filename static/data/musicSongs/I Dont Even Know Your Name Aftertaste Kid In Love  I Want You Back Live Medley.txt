Lyrics:


Say, I remember how you felt on that day
But I forget all the faces except one
And what hurts the most is that I'll never know what we could've been
But I guess that just means it wasn't fate

I was like oh you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out, yeah
But you don't have to do anything else, but be yourself, oh (Clap those hands)
Oh you dressed up so nice, but all I could see was your eyes
And the crowd came and pulled you away
And then you were gone
Woah-woah, yeah

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day, no no no
Cause I don't even know your name
No, I don't even know your name, no

(You guys felling good out there? Amazing, you look incredible!
I got this little sing along part for you, just repeat after me)

I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
(Sing that out for me)
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
(A little louder now sing it out)
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
(Sing it out now)
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
(Scream it)
I don't even, I don't evenâ and Iâ

I'm running I'm searching and I don't know where to start
I'm dying my love you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking till I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running I'm running I'm running
I'm running I'm searching baby
(Sing it out)
I'm dying my love you punched a hole right through my heart, no

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
And I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory in the aftertaste

(This is kid in love everybody sing it with me!)

I know that we just met and maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
Cause it's all right, it's all right I wanna make you mine
The way you lighten up the room
Got the corner of my eye
We could both sneak out the back door
We don't have to say goodbye
Cause it's all right, it's all right I wanna make you mine yeah-yeah

(Alright New York City sing this as loud as you can, here we go!)

Maybe I'm just a kid in love, maybe I'm just a kid in love oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love then I don't ever want to grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, maybe I'm just a kid in love oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love then I don't ever want to grow up

Cause I've got it all
(Wave those hands)
I've got it all, yeah
But I don't ever want to grow up
I've got it all
I've got it all, no no na na
I don't ever want to grow up

Cause you make me feel like I've got it all, yeah
And you make me feel, yeah
Like I'm just a kid in love
And you make me feel, baby
Like I've got it all, no no
No you make me feel, yeah
Like I was just a kid in love

And I was singing oh baby give me one more chance, yeah
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
Now since I see you
You, in his arms

You got me singing like
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, maybe I'm just a kid in love oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love then I don't ever want to grow up
(Scream it!)
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, maybe I'm just a kid in love oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love we don't ever have to grow up

Cause I've got it all, yeah yeah yeah
No I've got it all, yeah
I don't ever want to grow up

And I've got it all, yeah
All no no no no no
No I've got it all, oh yeah
And I don't ever want to grow up

I've got it all
(Clap those hands)
All, I've got it all
I don't ever want to grow up
I've got it all, yeah
All, no no no no no
No I've got it all, yeah
We don't ever have to grow up
