Lyrics:


Every now and then we all want something
Even if there's no way of gettin' it
If I stomp my feet could that make me
Be the way around it?
Could I get myself around it?

Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
So, get me what I want
'Cause I'm a big shot

Don't wanna always have to be so nice
Don't wanna hear you say, "Well, that's just life."
I'll try it out when I open my mouth
And make my way around it,
I always make my way around it

Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
Get me what I want
'Cause I'm a big shot

So give me what I want
I always get what I want
You don't want to see me
When I don't get what I want
It's not what you want

I'm not about to take "No" for an answer, no
If I tell you I can't I'm still gonna go
I did it all by myself, and I found
I found my way around it

Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
Get me what I want
'Cause I'm a big shot

So give me what I want
I always get what I want
You don't want to see me
When I don't get what I want
It's not what you want

It's not too lovely
It could start to get ugly
It really bugs me
If I don't get my way

Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
So, get me what I want
'Cause I'm a big shot

So give me what I want
I always get what I want
You don't want to see me
When I don't get what I want
It's not what you want
You better get what I want
It's not what you want
