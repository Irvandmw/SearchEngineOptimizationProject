Lyrics:


[Excerpt from Paid In Full:]
A nigga like me man, I love the game, I love the hustle man
I be feeling like one of them ball player niggas you know
Like Bird, Magic or something
Yeah you know a nigga got dough a nigga can leave the league
But if I leaveâ¦ the fans still gone love me man?

Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?
Came in this game as a kid, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?

I ainât do it, people said I did, huh?
Rap music ainât what's fuckin' up they kids, huh?
Gangster rap is fuckinâ up the biz, huh?
My influence, something that I said, cuh?
Like Iâm jewish, all about the bread, huh
From the sewage, tryinâ to get ahead, huh
Iâm bout to do it, fuckinâ up they head, huh?
These opportunist, fuckinâ up they bread, huh?
Corporate America stance is irregular
Ready Cuz, rap sheet, impeccable
Multi plats, my past
What we have here is unprofessional
My metal, undetectable, my style, unselectable
Niggas runninâ they mouth thats unacceptable
21st street, Long Beach 'til the death of you

Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?
Came in this game as a kid, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?

Keep shootinâ, thats what the people tell me, huh
Get the biggest dope sack that you can sell me, huh
And your homegirl do it, huh
I make the whole world do it, huh
Ainât no limit to the dog and that's real talk
Iâm the one that showed you how a real crip walk
Resume, document, G-File
Recollect, reflect, and let me break it down
Take it out the bag, lay it on the table quick
Call my handlers, I handle and disable this
Tickinâ time bomb, made crippinâ look fun
Canât walk around without your motherfuckinâ gun, that's a no no
Real hood redemption, my tiny Lokos is really on a mission
Niggas runninâ they mouth thats unacceptable
21st Street, Long Beach 'til the death of you

Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?
Came in this game as a kid, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?

Do anybody in the house remember?
When it wasnât no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
It wasnât no rappers talkingâ bout the LBC (Hell nah)
So its safe to say, I put it on the map, huh
So if you see me on the block, yeah, Iâm back, huh
And if you donât think you know where Iâm at, huh
You wanna battle, little homie, get your racks up
Boy you need to kit kat, make you niggas get back
Split you like a kit kat, the big homie did that
Rollinâ like a rebel though, Iâm on a whole ânother level though
My heart, my hair, My G, my seat, that part right there
Iâm more than a rapper though, pure intellectual
Smooth as a criminal, you hear me though?

Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?
Came in this game as a kid, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippinâ to your kids, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?
