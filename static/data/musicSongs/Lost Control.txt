Lyrics:


Hmm, yeah

Mirrors they never lie
Don't see myself inside
Why can't I get it right?
I don't know

You're always watching me fall
Shadows, they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feel so good inside, now I know

I lost, I lost
I lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame
I lost control again

I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame
I lost control again

Tired of being afraid
But lately, I lost my faith
What is love without pain?
It ain't home

You're watching me, but I'm below
When I get caught, I hope
It's the kind of blackout that will
Take me home

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside, now I know

I lost, I lost
I lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame
I lost control again

I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame
I lost control again

I know that I'm a mess
But I ain't tryna be the best
So, whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay

Never said I was an angel
I am damaged all the way
So, whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay

I lost, I lost
I lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame
I lost control again

I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame
I lost control again
