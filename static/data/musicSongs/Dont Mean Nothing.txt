Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Sometimes you feel it
Other times you're bored
You understood me once
But now you're lost
You weren't sorry
For things that you said
And it don't mean nothing
Cause we're already dead

You know I mean it
You know I'm scared
I've seen a hundred like you
Running out of air
You know I love you
But you soon will see
That it don't mean nothing
Till you figure out what it means

It's clear to me, you're like
The oceans and the light
Try and you'll remember what you used to be
It's clear to me this day can take you for a ride
A place that you once longed to be
I know you're tired
I know you're hurt
One day, I promise, baby
You gonna make it work
But for now the question
Is laying in our hands
And it don't mean nothing
Till we figure out the plan

It's clear to me, you're like
The oceans and the light
Try and you'll remember what you used to be
It's clear to me this day will take you for a ride
A place that you once longed to be

One day you'll ask me
What I thought of this
If you don't recognize it
Then you never will
Oh baby don't you see I'm never coming home
And it don't mean nothing
No it don't mean nothing
No it don't mean nothing
