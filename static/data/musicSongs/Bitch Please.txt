Lyrics:


[Xzibit:]
Yeah
Time to bring your ass to the table y'all
It's X to the Z, Xzibit, yeah
(Where you at?)
Snoop double D, uh O-G
(West coast, Los Angeles)
Uh, bring it live, Dr. Dre
What
Throwin' up a big ass W
Coverin' up the world, right
Yeah, listen, look

[Xzibit:]
You ain't tryna hot box with me
I swig hard liquor
Goin' down by the second round
All hail the underground
How that sound?
Xzibit backin' down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense, terrorist
Hidden bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap
Like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5, minimum wage
What type of life is that for me
It's blasphemy
You fuckin' 'round with the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity
To wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck
Slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin' tryin' to stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' treated like a prostitute
So check the SoundScan

[Snoop Dogg:]
All I wanna be was a G, ha
My whole life nigga please ha
Breaking off these motherfuckin' keys, ha
Let's get these motherfuckin' G's, ha
Nigga you don't wanna fuck with this

[Snoop Dogg:]
Oh no, big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heazy baby
You jockin' my style
You so crazy
Dre say ain't no limit to this
As long as we drop gangster shit
Look here bitch
You fine and I dig your style
Come fuck with a nigga
Do it doggystyle
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fucked in a rental
Lincoln Continental

Um, coast to coast
L.A. to Chicago
(Yeah, nigga, you know what's happening, man)
I get this pussy everywhere that I go
(These bitches know what time it is)
Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know
(Yeah, oh, a story 'bout a nigga like me)
I get this pussy everywhere that I go
Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know
(I pimp these hoes nigga)

[Xzibit:]
Bitch please
Get down on your goddamn knees
For this money, chronic, clothes and weed
Look, you fuckin' with some real OGs
Bitch please
Bitch please
Get down on your motherfuckin' knees
We came to get the motherfuckin' Gs
Yeah, you fuckin' with some real OGs
You dick-tease

[Snoop Dogg:]
Bitch please
Now what you need to do is
Hand my coat
And roll me some dope
(for real)
Different strokes
For different folks
Oh, you like settin' niggas up and gettin' them locs
Oh, cute little bitch with a whole lot of heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she gots a lick for me
(well hook it up)
Worth about 200 Gs and 30 kis
Now check this out Dre
Now if I don't move
Then a nigga like me
Shit I don't lose
But you know me
Dogg I'm movin'
Ain't nothin' to it, but to get to groovin'

You've been waitin' on a nigga like me
What's that
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
(what about)
That's the devil
They always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (bang bang)
I'm tryin' to work this cold thing
And take this whole thing
I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money for sure
I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money for sure

[Nate Dogg:]
Ayyo, ayyo, ayyo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claimin' DPG
'Til the day I D-I-E

Ayyo, ayyo, ayyo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claimin' DPG
'Til the day I D-I-E

Ayyo, ayyo, ayyo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claimin' DPG
'Til the day I D-I-E

Ayyo, ayyo, ayyo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claimin' DPG
'Til the day I D-I-E
