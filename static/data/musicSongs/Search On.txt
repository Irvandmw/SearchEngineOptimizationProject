Lyrics:


When I talk to you, you seem so confused
You don't know what to do, you say your whole life has been misused
Your direction is not clear, love in your life you'll never need
When I talk to you this way, I leave now only one thing to say

(Search on)
Search on for love and try not to let the search get you down
Someday you'll find it
(Search on)
I know you'll find it

Search on for love and let nothing stand in your way
I know you'll find it
(Search on)
Someday you'll find your love

You've been hurt by love and it's changed the way you feel
You've been deserted by love so now the whole thing seems so unreal
So the question is now, do I turn and just walk away
Or do I stand up and fight, oh, yeah? What do I do, what? Oh, keep saying

(Search on)
Search on for love, let nothing stand in your way
I know, I know, I know, I know you'll find it
(Search on)
I know you'll find it, yeah

(Search on)
Search on for love, try not to let the search get you down
I know you'll find it
(Search on)
Someday you'll find your love
