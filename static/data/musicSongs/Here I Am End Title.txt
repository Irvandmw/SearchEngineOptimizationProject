Lyrics:


Here I am, this is me
There's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be
Here I am, it's just me and you
Tonight we make our dreams come true

It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
Here I am

Here I am

Here we are, we've just begun
And after all this time, our time has come
Yeah here we are, still going strong
Right here in the place where we belong

It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
Here I am

Yeah, here I am
Here I am

Waiting for you!

Here I am, this is me
There's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be
Here I am, it's just me and you
Tonight we make our dreams come true

It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
(waiting, waiting, waiting)

It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
(waiting, waiting, waiting)
Here I am

(Here I am)
Here I am
(Here I am)
Here I am
(Here I am)
Right next to you
(Here I am)
And suddenly the world is all brand new

Here I am
(Here I am)
Here I am
(Here I am)
I'm gonna stay
Now there's nothing standing in our way
Here I am

Here I am, this is me
