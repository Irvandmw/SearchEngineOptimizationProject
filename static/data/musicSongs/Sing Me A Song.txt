Lyrics:


Sing me a song, you can't go wrong
It doesn't have to rhyme
Sing me a song, it won't take long
You oughta take the time

I came in wonderin', what it's all about
Now I know, 'cause I've been told
I got it figured out
So won't you

Sing me a song, you can't go wrong
It doesn't have to rhyme
Sing me a song, it won't take long
You oughta take the time

Sing a song to me now
Sing a song and make me happy, yeah
'Cause I can't go on much longer
The feelin' here's gettin' stronger
Come on and sing me a song

Come on and sing me a song

Met an old man the other day
He remembered when
He left home to be alone
And now he needs a friend
So won't you

Sing him a song, you can't go wrong
It doesn't have to rhyme
Sing him a song, but don't take long
He doesn't have the time

Sing a song to me now
Sing a song and make me happy, yeah
'Cause I can't go on much longer
The feelin' here's gettin' stronger
Come on and sing me a song
