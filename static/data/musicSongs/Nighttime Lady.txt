Lyrics:


Nighttime lady, stay with me tonight
Hold me close girl
'Til we see the morning light
Nighttime lady, hold your head up high
Lay down beside me, it's allright

Nighttime lady, you're my only friend
Reassure me, love me if you can
Nighttime lady, girl I need you so
Take me with you now, before you go

Nighttime lady, honey hair of gold
Warm my body in the cradle of your soul
Nighttime lady, girl I love you so
Take me with you now, before you go

Nighttime lady, artist of the night
Paint your pictures, of faceless beds of white
Nighttime lady, sad eyed girl of mine
When the morning comes, we'll let it shine
