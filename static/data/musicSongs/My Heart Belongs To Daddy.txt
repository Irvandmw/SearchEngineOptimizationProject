Lyrics:


While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy
If I invited a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more, but
My heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
And so I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to daddy
'Cause my daddy
He treats it
So well
