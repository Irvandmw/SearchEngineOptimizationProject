Lyrics:


They say get ready for the revolution
I think it's time we find some sorta solution
Somebody's caught up in the endless pollution
They need to wake up, stop living illusions

I know you need to hear this
Why won't somebody feel this

This is my wish that we all feel connected
This is my wish that nobodies neglected

Be like a rocket baby
Be like a rocket

Take off
Just fly, away-ay-ay
To find your space

Take off
Just fly, away-ay-ay
To find your place
Take off

You know what they say about mixing the races
And in the end we got the same faces
My mama told me got love yourself first
And if you disagree, get off this damn earth

I want to feel connected
Don't want to be neglected

This is my wish that we all find our places
This is my wish that we all escalate, yeah

Be like a rocket baby
Be like a rocket

Take off
Just fly, away-ay-ay
To find your space

Take off
Just fly, away-ay-ay
To find your space

Take off
Just fly, away-ay-ay
To find your space

Take off
Just fly, away-ay-ay
To find your space
Take off

You'll wanna see everything
Hear this and you'll want to sing
Anywhere you wanna
Everything you wanna
All you will have to is be
Think it and you can achieve
Everything's not what it seems
Anywhere you wanna
Everything you wanna
All you will have to is be

Like a rocket
Just fly, away-ay-ay
To find your space

Take off
Just fly, away-ay-ay
To find your space

Take off, take off
Be like a rocket baby
Be like a rocket
Take off, take off
Be like a rocket baby
Be like a rocket
