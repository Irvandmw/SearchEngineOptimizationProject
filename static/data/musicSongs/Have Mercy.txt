Lyrics:


Ships are moving closer to the shoreline
And we're laughing in the face of loaded guns
I saw it on the news, we ain't got no worry
But it won't be in the paper when d day comes

Lord, have mercy
For we know not what we do
Have mercy
We've forgotten to be afraid of you

Who can solve the problems of a nation
We cure the symptoms but we're killed by the disease
I feel I've more than made my contribution
But I hope there's room in heaven for my ego and me

Lord, have mercy
For we know not what we do
Have mercy
We've forgotten to be afraid of you
Have mercy
Lend us your hand
Lord, have mercy
Give us just another chance

Too many coaches on the sideline
Too many keepers in the zoo
How will we know we've passed the deadline
Give us the strength to stand or fall
God in heaven, have mercy on us all

The ships are even closer to the shoreline
Now we're playing in a madman's house of fun
I read it in the news we ain't got no worry
But it won't be in the paper when d day comes

Lord, have mercy
