Lyrics:


(Listen)
(Ohh, ohh)
(Ohh, ohh)

I'm sick of all this waiting
And people telling me what I should be
What if I'm not so crazy
Maybe you're the one that's wrong, not me
So what you gonna do, what you gonna say
When we're standing on top and do it our way
You say we got no future
You're living in the past
So listen up, that's my generation

[CHORUS]
(hey ho, let's go!)
It's going down tonight
(hey ho, let's go!)
We're gonna do it til we die
(hey ho, let's go!)
'Cause I, I, I got no reason to apologize
That's my generation

(ohh, ohh)
(ohh, ohh)

I don't need to say I'm sorry
I do what everybody wants to do
It's not so complicated
'Cause I know you want the same thing, too
So what you gonna do, what you gonna say
When we're standing on top and do it our way
You say we got no future
You're living in the past
So listen up, that's my generation

[CHORUS]

(Listen)

Don't need to say I'm sorry
(ohh, ohh)
It's not so complicated
'Cause I know you want the same thing, too

[CHORUS (x2)]
