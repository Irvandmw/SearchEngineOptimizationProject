Lyrics:


Yeah, I know that it's over
And there's nothing that I can do
So I won't try, I won't try holding on to you
Just answer one question before you go
Cause there's just one thing it would have to know

(So tell as you're leaving) Tell me as you're leaving
(Where you're going and how far) Where you're going how far
(Cause what if I should ever need you) What if I should ever need you
(And I'm not where you are) And I'm not where, where you are
(And I'm not where you are) And I'm not where, where you are

Oh, we were so close to each other
And we shared so much
Scares me to think that, that we might loose touch
There's so many lights in the city and so many motors
I just like to know, yes I would, I wanna know which one is yours

(So tell as you're leaving) Tell me as you're leaving
(Where you're going and how far) Where you're going and how far
(Cause what if I should ever need you) Cause what if I should ever need you
(And I'm not where you are) And I'm not where you are, oh
(And I'm not where you are) And I'm not where, where you are
(I gotta know where you are) And I'm not where you are, oh
(Where you are) And I'm not where, not where you are, eh
(I gotta know where you are) And I'm not where you are, oh, oh, oh
(Where you are) And I'm not where you are, call me baby
(I gotta know where you are) And I'm not where you are, baby, call me baby
(Where you are) And I'm not where, I gotta know where
