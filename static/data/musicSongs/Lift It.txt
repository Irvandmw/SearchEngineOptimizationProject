Lyrics:


In my temptation to walk away
And through the endless troubled days
There's a hundred million ways
For me to release Your praise
And by and by, through the tears
And things You've taught me through the years
My whole life was designed by You
I'll never know anyone half as true

Lift it up, I lift it up
Lift it up so You can see
Lift it up, I lift it up
Lift it up from inside of me
Lift it up, I lift it up
Lift it up so You can see
Lift it up, I lift it up

So I lift it
I lift it up to You
And I'll never forget the times that we've been through
So I lift it
I said I lift it up to You
And I surrender all of me
To You, to You, to You
Everything I'll ever be
To You, to You, to You
I surrender all of me
