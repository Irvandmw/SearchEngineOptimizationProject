Bangladesh

Smooches, baby
She wanna kiss it
Smooches, baby
She wanna kiss it
Smooches, baby
She wanna kiss it
Smooches, baby
Seal it with a kiss
She wanna kiss down on me
She wanna put her lips on me
She wanna kiss down on me
She wanna put her lips on me

It's dedicated to the girls around the world
Mr. Kiss Kiss, got a song for y'all
Look at my picture on your bedroom wall, wall
You know I can't forget ya

Swagger still the same, money never been a issue
And when I leave your city, you know that I'ma gonna miss ya
Wish I could kiss every one of y'all
Every one of y'all
Every one of y'all wanna give me

Smooches, baby
She wanna kiss it
Smooches, baby
She wanna kiss it
Smooches, baby
She wanna kiss it
Smooches, baby
Seal it with a kiss
She wanna kiss down on me
She wanna put her lips on me
She wanna kiss down on me
She wanna put her lips on me

Now every single time, I gotta raise the bar
Give you another reason just to take me home
She whispered in my ear that the crib not far
And then I have to give her that, "Oh my God"

Swagger still the same, money never been a issue
And when I leave your city, you know that I'ma gonna miss ya
Wish I could kiss every one of y'all
Every one of y'all
Every one of y'all wanna give me

Smooches, baby
She wanna kiss it
Smooches, baby
She wanna kiss it
Smooches, baby
She wanna kiss it
Smooches, baby
Seal it with a kiss
She wanna kiss down on me
She wanna put her lips on me
She wanna kiss down on me
She wanna put her lips on me

Smooches, baby
Sm-Smooches, baby
Smooches, baby
Sm-Smooches, baby
Smooches, baby
Sm-Smooches, baby
