Lyrics:


One day I went meanderin' to find myself a wife
A pretty miss to share my kiss and love me all my life
The lonely bachelor's life I led began to get me down
I bought a ring and everything and went right into town

I went (meanderin', meanderin'
Looking far and wide for a girl to be my bride
I went meanderin', meanderin')
Far from the old folks at home

I ran into a friend of mine while wandering down the street
He said he had a sister that I ought to meet
He took me home to meet her but she weighed two hundred ten
I shook my head and sadly said "oh here I go again"

I went (meanderin', meanderin'
Looking far and wide for a girl to be my bride
I went meanderin', meanderin')
Far from the old folks at home

I came across a pretty girl who said she'd love me so
But she would bring her mother with us everywhere we'd go
I was so happy on the day she said she'd be my wife
But when she told me her ma would live with us for life

I went (meanderin', meanderin'
Looking far and wide for a girl to be my bride
I went meanderin', meanderin')
Far from the old folks at home

Finally found myself a wife a gal who's sweet and true
And when I'm tempted to do something I shouldn't do
Then I remember days when things are not like they are now
Well I recall when I was just a bachelor and how

I went meanderin', meanderin'
For looking far and wide for a girl to be my bride
I went meanderin', oh meanderin'
Far from the old folks at home
