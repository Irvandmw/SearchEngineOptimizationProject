Lyrics:


007 and Brucey Wayne
Are shitting there âselves because thereâs another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

Heâs certainly come into his own,
Thereâs one on his arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like itâs boring to him
Itâs a war you canât win and the first and the last are two things youâll never
Be my darling

Another roll around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion it must be good
Oh wouldnât the penny would drop with an incredible thud
They forgot to kick the tin, he knows where sheâs going
But donât know where sheâs been
And as opposed to the âother thingâ
Heâll worry about it when itâs trouble heâs in

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like itâs boring to him
Itâs a war you canât win and the first and the last are two
Things youâll never be my darling

Things youâll never be my darling

(Two things you will never be my darling)

(Two things youâll never be my darling)

They sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
Not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(But not for this kid, not when they come to you.)
