Lyrics:


All she cares about is money and the city where sheâs from
Her intention is on paper, she donât need no fucking love
Sheâs spillinâ all this liquor tryna pass me all these cups
Well baby girl Iâm zoninâ somebody should have told her
I popped one
Fuck it I popped one
Oh girl Iâm on one
Fuck it I popped one
I popped one

Girl Iâm lying, Iâm on a few
Donât you worry this ain't new
Can we take this to your spot? I'm on eviction number two
'Cause I popped one

Fuck it I popped one
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Trust issues

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh

Do you know what's going on over here (I do, I do, I do)
Have you even bothered to look? (I did, oh, I did)
Well if you know, then let me know
We donât have to keep runninâ in these circles (in these circles)
No more

Trust issues
Trust issues
Trust issues
Trust issues
Trust issues

Trust issues, no more
Trust issues, no more
Trust issues, no more
