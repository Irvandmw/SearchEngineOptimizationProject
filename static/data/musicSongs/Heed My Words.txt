Lyrics:


After you're gone, you're gone
And the world carries on despite you
The flesh will gently give up
Like an overflowing cup will do

Whatever you want
To heed my words
Whatever you need
Take heed

After your worn, you're worn
No don't feel sorry for yourself
It's the only thing you know for sure
But the greedy are always wanting something else

Whatever you want
To heed my words
Whatever you need
Take heed

Oh remember
The hearts pounding thunder
Wasting my life away, oh
Waiting for the rapture, oh

Whatever you want
To heed my words
Whatever you need
Take heed
