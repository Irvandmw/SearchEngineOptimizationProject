Lyrics:


Everyday the same routine
Operating life machine
On and on we live this way
With no spontaneity

What happened to the wild ones?
No sense of the hours
What happened to the freedom?
Did we get that back?

So we're going, going through the motions
We're just going, going through the motions
We used to live like waves in the oceans
Now we're going, going through the motions

What if I said 'let's run away'?
A one way ticket to an exotic place
Dance and scream and shout in the pouring rain
Find serenity in the great escape

What happened to the wild ones?
No sense of the hours
What happened to the freedom?
Can we get that back?

'Cause we're going, going through the motions
We're just going, going through the motions
We used to live like waves in the oceans
Now we're going, going through the motions

(I can't keep going, I can't keep going, I can't keep going
I can't keep going, I can't keep going, I can't keep going)
I can't, I can't, I can't

Said I can't keep going, going through the motions
You can't keep going, going through the motions
We used to live life with so much emotion
Can't keep going, going through the motions
