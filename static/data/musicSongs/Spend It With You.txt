Lyrics:


Here, if we had one day on Earth
Who would you spend it with?
If you could choose who you wanted to kiss
Who would that be?

I wanna believe
If tomorrow was not guaranteed
Minutes to spare, if I could choose
I would spend every minute with you

With you
With you
With you
I'd spend it with you

When all of the trees fall down
And all the seas dry out
And when we're waving goodbye to the world
Would you find me?

I wanna believe
If tomorrow was not guaranteed
Minutes to spare, if I could choose
I would spend every minute with you

With you
With you
With you
I'd spend it with you

I wanna believe
If tomorrow was not guaranteed
Minutes to spare, if I could choose
I would spend every minute with you

With you
With you
With you
I'd spend it with you

(You)
I'd spend it with you
