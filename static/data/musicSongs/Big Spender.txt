Lyrics:


The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction, a real big spender
Good lookinâ, so refined
Say, wouldnât you like to know whatâs goinâ on

(Big spender)

[Verse 1]
SM your boy Smiler iced out
Paid da cost to floss whatâs the price now?
Fresh out the gutter, the city begged me to rep it
Cuzzie I came with collateral, getters get me so fâ it Iâma (spender)

I plug money in harrods,
Iâm bugs bunny wit carrots,
Diamonds on my neck n my arm blinginâ with class,
Those that always speculated are now beginning to ask are you a (spender)

If itâs mines what is it?
If it shines what is it?
If ur coming at me with goods and youâre tryna pitch it
I know itâs cream oâ da crop if it isnât tell me what is it, Iâm a (spender)

Cash rules, my flash jewels are monumental
Brass fools just act cool with what credentials?
Itâs second nature, I floss n get it for real
Black n yellow diamonds all in my chain Iâm definitely Iâll

[Hook:]
Let me get right to the point
I donât pop my cork for every man I see
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me

[Verse 2]
Spend time or spend paper, smiler grinds
Never spend dimes I spend major, listen Iâm
That of a baller, I pick n try it to purchase
Pull paper outta my anus, itâs blatant buyingâs my purpose, Iâm a (spender)

Red carpets, red cameraâs- snap snap,
Red cars I said itâs standard, thatâs fact
Jetsetting and living leisurely, dropping
80 bags on the spot coz I got it so itâs my pleasure b (spender)

Strong broads are on fours to see who
Concords and tom fords, Iâm GQ
Gucci belling me âsmiler come in to preview
All the ish that came today and besides that, we wanna see youâ Iâm a (spender)

English kid, distinguished, talk is cheap
Linguistics, bling bling ish, noughts and gâs,
Brushing shoulders with movers, shakers n bosses
Call if itâs related to getting wagers or profits, Iâm a spender

[Hook:]
Let me get right to the point
I donât pop my cork for every man I see
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me

[Verse 3]
Cashcow, I splash out on things nice,
Cash out, wonât back down or think twice
Hit the boutiques, cop some for my honey too
Repertoire impressive, you comprehending that Iâm a true (spender)

The streets knows I keep dough,
Lace you with peeptoes and neat clothes,
How better could it get, competition are bluffing
Fâing with the boy wonder Iâll leave you wanting for nothing, Iâm a (spender)

Ainât nuttin that no dude can show you,
Trips to Florida, know food in Nobu,
Keys to convertibles that I place in ur palm
Links of London and the Tiffany that I place on your arm, Iâm a (spender)

Big stones, and cribs, homes, the high-life
Big shows and whips, those that I like,
When I draw for the Visa leave me alone, I get to swiping
F the prices Iâm in a league of my own Iâm a spender

[Hook:]
Let me get right to the point
I donât pop my cork for every man I see
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me
