Lyrics:


[2x]
What's your suggestion for tonight?
Should I turn off, or maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Uh hey Electric lady.

[Verse 1]
Oh my, you're skipping my heart
Kiss in the dark with your lightning eyes
Said that I want you to ignite fires all night
And you got the power
Youâre damn right
It's life or death
Not gonna make it if you donât connect tonight right

[Chorus:]
Strike twice all night,
Body moves like waves
Youâre reaching my heart fast
Youâre searching for something
Thatâs just how electricity behaves
Now we're needing it so bad,
The other ones donât last

Wait a minute Iâm feeling charged
I should've known how she glow in the dark,
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops,
I feel it jump, we get closer till we shock
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady

[Hook:]
Love wonât die, running low but girl your love won't die,
So what youâre giving me girl
All that energy give it here
You know how it goes sometimes,
Love wonât die, running low but girl,
Your love wonât die,
But if you need any girl
I got energy come and get it,
Know how it goes sometimes
Sometimes I need a little(more)
Give a little, if I get a little
We could meet any place
About the middle tonight,
And you got the power,
Baby you know, if you're ever low
I will go low and bring you back into the light.

[Chorus:]
Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
Youâre reaching my heart fast
Youâre searching for something(yeah)
Thatâs just how electricity behaves
And Iâve been needing it so bad
The other ones donât last

Wait a minute I'm feeling charged
I shouldâve known how she glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks
Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops,
I feel it jump, we get closer till we shock
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady

[2x]
What's your suggestion for tonight?
Should I turn off, or maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Uh hey Electric lady.

Wait a minute Iâm feeling charged
I shouldâve known how she glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops,
I feel it jump, we get closer till we shock
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady
