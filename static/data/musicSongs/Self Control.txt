Lyrics:


Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you I can't say no
I don't wanna taste, I want it all

When I get your call
I'm out at the door, not a minute more
Like an animal
I lose control, it's illogical
Oh, oh

One little kiss can turn into a thousand
One little touch and I'm gone

Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you I can't say no
I don't wanna taste, I want it all

Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
When it comes to you I can't say no
I don't wanna taste, I want it all

Na na na na na na
Nana nana na na na
[x4]

I'm so predictable
Fall every time, ain't it pitiful
And it's not enough
I tried to quit, but I'm giving up
Oh, oh

One little kiss can turn into a thousand
One little touch and I'm gone

Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you I can't say no
I don't wanna taste, I want it all

Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
When it comes to you I can't say no
I don't wanna taste, I want it all

Na na na na na na
Nana nana na na na
[x2]

And the hunger grows
I'm craving you and my body knows
'Cause it wakes me up
Heart through my chest, this could be love

One little kiss can turn into a thousand
One little touch and I'm gone

Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you I can't say no
I don't wanna taste, I want it all

Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
When it comes to you I can't say no
I don't wanna taste, I want it all

Na na na na na na
Nana nana na na na
[x2]
