Lyrics:


I woke up this morning
And realized
All I do is apologize
For a song I wrote in 2005
Didn't come with a warning
But fame is unkind
Put me on top of the world
Couple of girls and then left me behind

Sure, let's take a photograph
You can show it to your friends and laugh
I'll tell you what I'm doing now
But you don't really wanna know

I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a
Better love song
Without it I'd be no one
And now that you've forgotten me
Tell me how to write one better

I'm not gonna lie
Saying I didn't work out
'Cause I live in a big house, made a few pounds
Nice car on the drive
And I went round the world once or twice
Saw the sun set and sun rise
But for big highs, there's a big price
When all you do is criticize

Sure, let's take a photograph
You can show it to your friends and laugh
I'll tell you what I'm doing now
But you don't really wanna know

I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a
Better love song
Without it I'd be no one
And now that you've forgotten me
Tell me how to write one better

I don't think I can write one better

I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write one
Better love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a
Better love song
Without it I'd be no one
Now that you've forgotten me
Just tell me how to write one better

I woke up this morning
And realized
All I do is apologize
For a song I wrote in 2005
