Lyrics:


I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you

I didn't mean all the shit I say
But it's better than what's going on in my head
How dare you bring another chick in our bed
Youâre lucky Iâm doing my yoga or you might be dead
I ainât doin nothing that could take away my zen
If you are not enchanting then you fucked it up again
Lifeâs a bunch of tests, and we all just do our best
Searching for something outside ourselves to bring us happiness, yes

I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you

You and I don't know
What goes on for us
If we leave through the stars, weâll both know
Whatâs a life for us

I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
