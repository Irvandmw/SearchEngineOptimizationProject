Song Name: No More Christmas
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Well, there'll be peace and there's something on Christmas day
No more hunger, no more war
Check out this single day

Yes well, there'll be happiness someday on Christmas day
All those win brothers and sisters
Just one single day

People fight for their gods
Die for their beliefs
Christians, Jews, and Muslims too
They knew not what they knew

Oh, well there'll be no more congress
No more religions too
And there will be peace on earth
But no more Christmas too
Oh, yes.
