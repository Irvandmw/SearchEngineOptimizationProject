Lyrics:


The warmth in your smile is the warmth that I desire,
'Cos it's cold and lonely in this place, oh yeah.
And I need to get close to the flames in a fire,
And lose myself in yesterday, oh yeah. 

[Chorus:]
It's gonna be a long long long time,
till I can be with you again, and see your smile.
It's gonna be a long long long time,
till I hold you in my arms all through the night,
it's gonna be a long long time. 

Lookin' outside and I feel so uninspired,
And It rain's all through this lonely night, oh yeah.
I'm losing my mind and my soul is feelin' tired,
'Cos girl you are my guiding light, oh yeah. 

It's gonna be a long long long time,
till I can be with you again, and see your smile.
It's gonna be a long long long time,
till I hold you in my arms all through the night,
it's gonna be a long long time. 

Girl I been missin' you, I never thought I'd feel this way.
All the feelings I have inside grow stronger everyday.
Girl I want you to know that I will never let you go.
You're the only one I really want
And there's one thing you've gotta know 

It's gonna be a long long long time,
till I can be with you again, and see your smile.
It's gonna be a long long long time,
till I hold you in my arms all through the night,
it's gonna be a long long time. 

It's gonna be a long long long time,
till I can be with you again, and see your smile.
It's gonna be a long long long time,
till I hold you in my arms all through the night,
it's gonna be a long long time.  

Listen girl I need you
Are you there?
There's nothing I can do about it
And I wanna hold you
And show you how much you mean to me
Oh yeah That's right
Don't you know I want you in my life, my life, my life
