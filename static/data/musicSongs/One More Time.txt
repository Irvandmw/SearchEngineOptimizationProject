Lyrics:


You know I don't wanna love you but I keep coming back, yeah
You know I'm hooked to you honey but you're making no tracks, uh uh
Well you're the only man with a chain to my soul
I keep trying to break it's only making me old
I can't blank you out, I'm nearly drowning in wine
I keep a-coming back to love ya just a one more time
One more

You know I see you every morning when I open my eyes
I don't need to hear ya talking cause I know it's all lies anyway, yeah it is
You know my daddy is a man but he never gets strange
Every time I turn around you're pulling some fast change on me, yes you are
I can't stand it, hell, I'm going out of my mind
I keep a-coming back to love ya just a one more time
One more

You know I don't wanna see you, never go to your place, no
I don't wanna let you see me, gonna cover up my face uh huh
You're like a magnet man all made of tin
I keep trying to get away you keep pulling me in again, yes you are
I can't stand it, hell, I'm going out of my mind
I keep a-coming back to love ya just a one more time
One more

One more time

You know I don't wanna love you but I keep coming back, yeah
You know I'm hooked to you honey but you're making no tracks, uh uh
Well you're the only man with a chain to my soul
I keep trying to break it's only making me old
I can't blank you out, I'm nearly drowning in wine
I keep a-coming back to love ya just a one more time
One more
