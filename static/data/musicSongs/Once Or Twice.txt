Lyrics:


Oh girl
I looked you over once or twice
I think that you are very nice
And you're just meant for me
Oh girl
I think you got a messed up mind
But if you will take the time
Baby i can set you free
Well I'm not trying to be
What i am not
But i think what you need
Is what i got
Girl I'm no philosopher
But i can offer you that cure
To mend your broken heart
I know that you are not blind
I know you see my messed up mind
Yes, you see my broken heart too
So won't you
Bring your heart and
Your mind that's out
On the run
Fuse them with my broken
Heart, in my mind
We'll be one.
Girl i looked you over once or twice
I think that you are very nice
And you're just meant for me
Girl i think you got a messed up mind
Now that you know yours is
Just like mine
Baby, won't you set me free
