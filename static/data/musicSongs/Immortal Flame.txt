Lyrics:


Lightning strikes only once in your life
I guess I'm lucky
'Cause I found myself
In the line of fire tonight
My heart beats like thunder under my skin
And my world speaks in wonder since you appear
Now we are here

And I
Could die
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame

Dreams hardly ever do come true
I guess I'm lucky cause I found myself waking up right next to you
Oh and with this raging heart of mine
I'll love you till the end of time
I thank the gods that our stars aligned
From the ocean floor to the distant sun
Forever more, to kingdom come
Have no fear
I'll be burning here

And I (and I)
Could die (could die)
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame (a shame)
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame (your immortal)
I'll be your (your immortal)
Ooh, I'll be your (your immortal)
Ooh, I'll be your (your immortal flame)

And I
Could die
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame...
I'll love you again and again
And everlasting fantasy
I'll be your immortal
