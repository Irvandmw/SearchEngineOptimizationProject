Lyrics:


Somewhere off the PCH with some bitches
Drinking hard lemonade
Never hungover from under-achieving
I'm getting carried away

I know a place where anything goes
Where the sea makes the purple weeds grow
Where the sun and the cars and the girls at the bars ride low

Chained, been a slave to a winter heartbreak
Got my mind on the warm Summer, stay
Where the days and the nights and the dreams and your vibe don't fade

Somewhere off the PCH with some bitches
Drinking hard lemonade
Never hungover from under-achieving
I'm getting carried away
Carried away
Carried away

I got Jack
Jack and Coke's no Sex on the Beach
If I close my eyes I can see
Desert palms in the sand and some tan legs wrapped around me

Somewhere off the PCH with some bitches
Drinking hard lemonade
Never hungover from under-achieving
I'm getting carried away
Carried away
Carried away
Carried away
Carried away
Carried away

Carried away, carried away
Crashing in a daydream
Wave after wave
Carried away, carried away
Crashing in a daydream
Wave after wave

Somewhere off the PCH with some bitches
Drinking hard lemonade
Never hungover from under-achieving
I'm getting carried away
Carried away

Somewhere off the PCH with some bitches
Drinking hard lemonade
Never hungover from under-achieving
I'm getting carried away
Carried away

Somewhere off the PCH with some bitches
Drinking hard lemonade
Never hungover from under-achieving
I'm getting carried away

Carried away, carried away
Crashing in a daydream
Wave after wave
Carried away, carried away
Crashing in a daydream
Wave after wave
