Lyrics:


No more company to feed
No more papers left to read
What's to do about it
Let's put out the lights and go to sleep

No more anything to drink
Leave those dishes in the sink
What's to do about it
Simply nighty-night and go to sleep

You're waiting now for me to say
I love you more and more and more dear
You're looking younger every day
You never were so sweet before dear

No more money in the bank
No cute baby we can spank
What's to do about it
Let's put out the lights and go to sleep

You're waiting now for me to say
I love you more and more and more dear
You're looking younger every day
You never were so sweet before dear

No more money in the bank
No cute baby we can spank
What's to do about it
Let's put out the lights
And go to sleep
