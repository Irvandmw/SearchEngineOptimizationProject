Song Name: Christmas Memories

Lyrics:


Singing carols, stringing popcorn, making footprints in the snow,
Memories, Christmas memories, they're the sweetest ones I know.
Cookies taking in the kitchen, calls in rhythm everywhere,
Proxies, Christmas memories, float like snowflakes in the air.
Oh the joy of waking Christmas mornings, the family round the tree,
We had a way of making Christmas morning as merry as can be,
I close my eyes and see shining faces
Of all the children who now have children of their own
Funny, but comes December, and I remember every Christmas I've known.
