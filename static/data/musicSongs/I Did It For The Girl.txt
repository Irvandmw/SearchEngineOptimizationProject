Lyrics:


High up on lake Ray Hubbard Bridgeâ¨
All the boys dared me to jumpâ¨
Before I could think or blink, I was air born

I knew Rebecca had her eye on meâ¨when I came up for air
She said boy you're crazyâ¨
I nearly died but she thought that I was king of the world

[Chorus:]
I did it for the girl with that pretty red sun dress onâ¨
Girl that kept me tore up all summer longâ¨
anything to keep her kissin', huggin', lovin' on me every minute
I did it, I did it for the girl

A couple years on down the roadâ¨
I asked Rebecca to marry meâ¨
I traded in that gold corvette for a diamond ring

I worked double shifts January through Juneâ¨ 
to give her that Jamaican honeymoon
â¨when the plane hit the sky with her by my side I was king of the world

[Chorus:]
I did it for the girl with that pretty red sun dress onâ¨
Girl that kept me tore up all summer longâ¨
anything to keep her kissin', huggin', lovin' on me every minute
I did it, I did it for the girl

[Bridge:]
Anything and everything I've done since then has been
For the girl!

Yeah, I did it
I did it for the girl with that pretty red sun dress onâ¨
Girl that kept me tore up all summer longâ¨
anything to keep her kissin', huggin', lovin' on me every minute
I did it, I did it for the girl
I did it for the girl
