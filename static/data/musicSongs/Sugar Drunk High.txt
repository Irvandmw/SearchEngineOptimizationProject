Lyrics:


We shed tears for movie scenes
No real fears, fake feelings
It's a sentimental wasteland
We're young enough to lose teeth
But not old enough for enemies
Still steering with both hands

We were just kids living young and naÃ¯ve
Running round streets like the King and the Queen
Gas light flicker in your eye, what are hopeless dreams?
Staying out waiting 'til they call off the search
Chewing gum, cherry coke until our brains burned
A sugar drunk high, we were the only ones, oh

The bitter taste of nicotine
Still alive on my coat and jeans
But you were the light that I saw standing in front of the sun
You were the girl on the hill singing all night, all night

We were just kids living young and naÃ¯ve
Running round streets like the King and the Queen
Gas light flicker in your eye, what are hopeless dreams?
Staying out waiting 'til they call off the search
Chewing gum, cherry coke until our brains burned
A sugar drunk high, we were the only ones

Maybe never be found
Like a drop in the ocean
If we ever grow up
We'll be gone in the moment

Sugar drunk high
Sugar drunk high
Sugar drunk high
We were living on a sugar drunk high
Sugar drunk high
Sugar drunk high
Sugar drunk high

We were just kids living young and naÃ¯ve
Running round streets like the King and the Queen
Gas light flicker in your eye, what are hopeless dreams?
Staying out waiting 'til they call off the search
Chewing gum, cherry coke until our brains burned
A sugar drunk high, we were the only ones

Maybe never be found
Like a drop in the ocean
If we ever grow up
We'll be gone in the moment
