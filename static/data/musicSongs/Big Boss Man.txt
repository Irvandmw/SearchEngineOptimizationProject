Lyrics:


Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Oh you ain't so big, you're just tall, that's all

You got me workin' boss man
A workin' round the clock
I need me a drink of water
But you just won't let me stop

Big boss man, oh, can't you hear me when I call?
You know that you ain't so big
You're just tall, that's all

I got to get myself a boss man
And he's gonna treat me right
He'll work me hard, real hard in the day time
But I sure rest easy and nice

Big boss man, can't you hear? Can't you hear me when I call?
Let me tell you, that you ain't, you ain't so big
You're just tall, that's all

Big boss man
Big boss man
Big boss man
Hey can't you hear me when I call
