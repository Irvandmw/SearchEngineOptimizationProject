Lyrics:


There's a song in the air, 
But the fair senorita 
doesn't seem to care 
for the song in the air. 
So I'll sing to my mule 
if you're sure she won't think that 
I am just a fool 
serenading a mule. 

Amigo mio, does she not have a dainty bray? 
She listens carefully to each little word we play. 
La bella Senorita?
Si, si, mi muchachito, 
She'd love to sing it too if only she knew the way. 
But try as she may, 
in her voice there's a flaw! 
And all that the lady can say 
is "E-E-AW!" 

There's a light in her eye, 
Tho' she may try to hide it, 
She cannot deny, 
there's a light in her eye. 
Oh! the charm of her smile 

so beguiles all who see her 
that they'd ride a mile 
for the charm of her smile. 

Amigo mio, is she listenin' to my song? 
No, no, mi muchachito, how could you be so wrong? 
La bella Senorita?
Si, Si, la senorita, 
If she knew all the words, 

Well, maybe she'd sing along... 

Her face is a dream 
like an angel I saw! 
But all that my darlin' can scream 
is: "E-E-AW!" 
Senorita donkey sita, not so fleet as a mosquito, 
but so sweet like my Chiquita, 
you're the one for me. 

You're... the one... for me!
