Lyrics:


Baby, canât you see
Iâm calling
A guy like you
Should wear a warning
Itâs dangerous
Iâm fallinâ

Thereâs no escape
I canât wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
Youâre dangerous
Iâm lovinâ it

Too high
Canât come down
Losing my head
Spinning âround and âround
Do you feel me now

Taste of your lips
Iâm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
Iâm addicted to you
Donât you know that youâre toxic
And I love what you do
Donât you know that youâre toxic

Itâs getting late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my devil's cup
Slowly
Itâs taking over me

Too high
Canât come down
Losing my head
Spinning âround and âround
Do you feel me now

Taste of your lips
Iâm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
Iâm addicted to you
Donât you know that youâre toxic
And I love what you do
Donât you know that youâre toxic

Taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic
And I love what you do
Donât you know that youâre toxic

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
[x2]
Intoxicate me now
