Lyrics:


(Roamer, roamer)
Hello, I'm coming at your town again
How's about a night, how's about a flight supernova
I know, that I've been kinda hot and cold
But you never go away, no matter what I say
In the moment

[Chorus:]
My meter's running low
I've been moving everywhere
Spreading out my wings, trying everything
But that's over, cause when I'm on my own
Waking up with someone new
It never feels the same, I'm mixing up their name
It's like a roamer

Goodbye, I'm going on the road again
But I'm bringing you along
In each and every song that we cover
And I, I always wanna see your face
Cause looking in your eyes, is where I see my life
When I'm older

[Chorus]

Like a roamer, like a roamer

Mississippi, Tennessee, Argentina, NYC
California, Mexico, like a roamer
Russia, San Francisco bay, Berlin to the UK
Round the world in 80 days
Like a roamer

When I go away, don't wanna go away
Don't wanna go away, don't wanna go away
Don't wanna go away, don't wanna go away

[Chorus x2]

Mississippi, Tennessee, Argentina, NYC
California, Mexico, like a roamer
Russia, San Francisco bay, Berlin to the UK
Round the world in 80 days
Like a roamer
