Lyrics:


You've been livin' way to long in broken promiseland
Your dreams crushed and scattered like a million grains of sand
I'd love to be your redemption but I am just a man
And I may never be a hero
But I'm a rock you can lean on

If I don't love you like you deserve
If I don't stop every tear you're cryin'
If I don't make your life a heaven on this earth
I'll die tryin' I'll die tryin'

I'll listen to your secret prayer and share your deepest wish
Search for a hundred years just to find the perfect kiss
Of everything within' my power there's nothin' I won't give
To be that part of you and your life
That takes what's wrong and makes it right

[Repeat Chorus]

I may never be a hero
But I'm a rock you can lean on
I wanna be that part of you and your life
That takes what's wrong and makes it right

[Repeat Chorus]

I'll die tryin'
I'll die tryin'
I'll die tryin'

Don't just call it quits say there's no chance for you out there
I know you're at a crossroads where love doesn't seem to be fair
He made no effort to satisfy all your hopes and dreams
But if you'll give love another shot and look to me

I'll die trying
Hold on to me show me your needs
I'll fly higher
Give what I can give as sure as I live
I'll die tying
