Lyrics:


I've been dancing by myself tonight (myself tonight)
Close my eyes, I'm fading with the lights

Did you always keep me in the dark?
If you knew why did you let me stay?
Should'a never let you break my heart
Now there's nothing left for me to say

Cause I'm lost in the silence
Between you and me
Now you're gone
Nothing's left of what used to be
That's ok, that's alright
Go ahead and live your life
That's ok, that's alright
But don't blame me if I get sad sometimes

I still got a messed up point of view (point of view)
All I see in everything is you, oh

Did you always keep me in the dark?
If you knew why did you let me stay?
Should'a never let you break my heart
Now there's nothing left for me to say

Cause I'm lost in the silence
Between you and me
Now you're gone
Nothing's left of what used to be
That's ok, that's alright
Go ahead and live your life
That's ok, that's alright
But don't blame me if I get sad sometimes

But don't blame me if I get sad sometimes

Sad sometimes
Sad sometimes
