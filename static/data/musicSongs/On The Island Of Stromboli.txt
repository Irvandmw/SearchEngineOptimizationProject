Lyrics:


On the island of Stromboli
Recklessly, I gave my heart
On the island of Stromboli
Every dream I own had its start

If you tell me it was madness
I can only shrug and sigh
If you ask me for a reason
I can't tell you why

It wasn't the moonlight
For there wasn't a moon
No violins were playing
Yet our heart strings were in tune

How can I forget Stromboli?
How can I begin to try?
Tell me I'll regret Stromboli
I'll say what care I

No luce da luna
Perche luna non c'era
Sez ai en quan di violini
Con ecuando se en son

How can I forget Stromboli?
How can I begin to try?
Tell me I'll regret Stromboli
I'll say what care I
