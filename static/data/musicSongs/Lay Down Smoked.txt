Lyrics:


Move the fuck out the way,
This might get rain today
Donât wanna play now
Iâm on a roll
That's where I plan to stay
Forget the badge you made
And lay down

Nigga better watch what the fuck you say to me
Tricks are for kids donât play with me
Youâll get smoked, I ainât for the bullshit
Got the chrome bulldog for that bullshit
Problem nigga, itâs ok with me 
The revolver always stay with me
Youâll get smoked, I ainât for the bullshit
44 bulldog for that bullshit

Nigga that was my mama crack spot
I got birth rights
I lay a nigga out on the turf nice
Fuck a fist fight
Shit shift all of sudden, you can box my box cutter as I can see it cutting
Lord have mercy, jesus, lord have mercy
I bet this hurts you like it hurts me, it hurts
Hot as hell when that gunpowder burning
What goes around donât come around
When Iâm putting work in
Nigga swallow your pride and run you stick around your done

Move the fuck out the way
This might get rain today
Donât wanna play now
Iâm on a roll
Thatâs where I plan to stay
Forget the badge you made
And lay down

I donât know you what the fuck you wanna say to me
Iâm telling you niggas donât play with me
Youâll get smoked, I ainât for the bullshit
Got the chrome bulldog for that bullshit
Body on the ground itâs ok with me
I make examples so niggas donât play with me
Youâll get smoked, I ainât for the bullshit
44 bulldog for that bullshit

I got a gun fetish, choppa in the trunk
I shoot a duck flying right out the sky with the punk
A nigga 8 out of 8 of moving targets
16 in the clip, Iâll dump them all in your whip
You think Iâm joking, Iâm not
Youâll find out when that glock get to dumping
And your back get hot
I got a temper, you donât wanna test my patience
And end up docâs new patient
Stump your head on the pavement
You try and come at me on some brave shit
