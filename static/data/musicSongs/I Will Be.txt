Lyrics:


There's nothing I could say to you
Nothing I could ever do
To make you see
What you mean to me

All the pain, the tears I cried
Still you never said goodbye
And now I know
How far you'd go

I know I let you down
But it's not like that now
This time I'll never let you go

I will be all that you want and get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything OK

I thought that I had everything
I didn't know what life could bring
But now I see
Honestly

You're the one thing I got right
The only one I let inside
Now I can breathe
'Cause you're here with me

And if I let you down
I'll turn it all around
'Cause I would never let you go

I will be all that you want and get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything OK

'Cause without you I can't sleep
I'm not gonna ever ever let you leave
You're all I got
You're all I want
Yeah

And without you
I don't know what I'd do
I could never ever live a day without you
Here with me
Do you see? You're all I need

And I will be all that you want and get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life (my life) I will be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything OK

I will be (I'll be) all that you want and get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
And all my life you know I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything OK
