Lyrics:


I'm taking a moment just imaginin' that I'm dancin' with you
I'm your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes
You got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you
And you have your own engaging style
And you've got the knack to vivify
And you make my slacks a little tight, you may unfasten them if you like
That's if you crash and spend the night

But you don't fold, you don't fade
You've got everything you need, especially me
Sister you've got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all

Curl your upper lip up and let me look around
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip then bite down
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
Because they're the perfect jumping off point, getting closer to your

Butterfly
Well you float on by
Oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right
But you don't fold, you don't fade, you got everything you need
Especially me
Sister you've got it all

You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk sister you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all

You've got it all, you've got it all

Doll I need to see you pull your knee socks up
Let me feel you upside down, slide in, slide out, slide over here
Climb into my mouth now child

Butterfly, well you landed on my mind
Damn right you landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
And now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
I wanna fly with you and I don't wanna lie to you
Cause I, cause I can't recall a better day
Sun coming to shine on the occasion

You're an open-minded lady
You've got it all
And I never forget a face
Except for maybe my own
I have my days
Let's face the fact here, it's you who's got it all

You know that fortune favors the brave
Well let me get paid while I make you breakfast
The rest is up to you, you make the call

You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all

I can't recall a better day
Sun comin' to shine on the occasion
Hey sophisticated lady, oh you've got it all

You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all

Butterfly, baby, well you got it all
