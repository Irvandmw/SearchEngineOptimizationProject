Lyrics:


I reach out when I have a confession
I reach out in desperation
I reach out when no one is listening
So I go looking for the next best thing

Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow
Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow

I feel them judging on me for their own pleasure
If they really knew theyâd know better
That Iâm the one who caves under pressure
When desperate times call for desperate measures

Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow
Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow

I know thereâs got to be some peace in me
But I canât find it
I get so sick of looking

Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow
Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow

Too hard to swallow
