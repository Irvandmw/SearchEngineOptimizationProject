Lyrics:


Ah take a look and you'll see the way I have become and the way things became
Sadness and sorrow are here in the little things you touched with your hands
This loving home was a home so happy to protect you and keep you with care
The flowers in the window were smiling were glowing just knowing you were there
Listen my love nevermore Don't ever go away
Cause we are you are your life and your dream and we want you to stay
Come in my love come to me don't let this heartless world
bring another good bye
Embrace me in a simple way
Don't speak don't remember and darling don't cry
