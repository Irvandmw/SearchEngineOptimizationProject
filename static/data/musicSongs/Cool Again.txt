Lyrics:


I've been thinkin' about ya lately
Reminiscin', going crazy
Miss the way your kiss would keep me up
Hey, wish that you were here tonight
Drinkin' vodka soda, extra limes
And we could just get back to being us

'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

Do you ever think about
The days we couldn't live without each other?
Where the hell did we go wrong?
Hey, how'd we go from that to this?
How'd we let a good thing slip?
Do we really have to go move on?

I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah
Yeah, I just wanna be cool again

(Cool again, cool again, cool again, cool again)

'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

(Cool again, cool again, cool again)
Y'all know that I just wanna be cool again (Cool again, cool again, cool again)
Last summer with you (Cool again, cool again, cool again)
Cool again
(Cool again, cool again) Cool again, yeah
