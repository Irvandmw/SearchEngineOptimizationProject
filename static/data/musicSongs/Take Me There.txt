Lyrics:


We ain't got a reason to get out of bed
Just going through life, not living yet
We need motivation and no more regret
'Cause we can still dream, let's not forget

But I know, I know, I know how to ease your mind
Let go, let go, leave all this shit behind

Let's make the most of this moonlight
Let's raise them up 'cause there might never be a chance like this
Let's find a way to the west coast
Don't hesitate 'cause there won't ever be a chance like this
And you know I wanna be there
Come on and take me there
You know I wanna be there

You think I'm crazy
Can't just pick up and go
How can we start again
New friends and everything we know
Oh, baby, believe me
Come on and put on your shoes
The sooner the better
I bet we ain't got nothing to lose

I know, I know, I know how to ease your mind
Let go, let go, leave all this shit behind

Let's make the most of this moonlight
Let's raise them up 'cause there might never be a chance like this
Let's find a way to the west coast
Don't hesitate 'cause there won't ever be a chance like this
And you know I wanna be there
Come on and take me there
You know I wanna be there

And all I see is you and me
We will be on the beach under the palm trees
Every day's like 80 degrees
Don't think too hard, it's not that far
As long as I got you everywhere, it's home

I know, I know, I know how to ease your mind
Let go, let go, leave all this shit behind

Let's make the most of this moonlight
Let's raise them up 'cause there might never be a chance like this
Let's find a way to the west coast
Don't hesitate 'cause there won't ever be a chance like this
And you know I wanna be there
Come on and take me there
You know I wanna be there
And you know I wanna be there
Come on and take me there
You know I wanna be there
So come on and take me there
