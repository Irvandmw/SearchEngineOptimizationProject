Lyrics:


A little voice deep within me
Says our romance is through
I've been suspicious lately
Your coldness gave me the clue
A little voice deep within me
Says we're drifting apart
The way you say I love you
No longer comes from your heart

I wanna hear you tell me
That your love still is strong
I want those old embraces
To prove my fears are wrong

You'll find that someday if you'll leave me
I will know how how to cry
With that little voice within me
I know how to tell you goodbye
With that little voice within me
I know how to tell you goodbye
