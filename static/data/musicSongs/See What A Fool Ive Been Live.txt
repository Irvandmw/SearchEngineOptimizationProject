Lyrics:


We'd like to leave you now with a number called "See What A Fool I've Been".

Well, she's gone, gone this morning.
See what a fool I've been.
Oh, Lord.
I said, "What a fool I've been."

I got a train, I come outta a train to Georgia.
Sixteen-coaches long.
Oh, Lord.
I said, "Sixteen-coaches long."

Sure it had.
Alright.

My dog is too hungry
It just, it just kept on barking.
Oh, he said he just don't feel the same
Oh, Lord
He said, "Just don't feel the same."
He said, I don't
He said, I don't
He said, I don't feel the same.
Oh, but...
Come on.

Well, she's gone, gone this morning.
See what a fool I've been.
Oh, Lord.
I said, "What a fool 
âMerry Christmas, everybodyâ
I've been."

Thank you. Goodbye.
