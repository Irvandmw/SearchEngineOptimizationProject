Lyrics:


Let's drive out to the desert at midnight
To dance in the dust of our headlights
And score some good seats for the sunrise
And dressed up in clothes we don't mind getting messed up
Where no one will know how to get us
We don't need a map, we'll just drive, drive, drive

I wanna get lost with you
And hide out, out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what it's like to spend a whole night with you, just you
You, just you

We can head north
Over the oceans of turquoise
Where after a while, there'll be no noise
Except for the sound of our heart beats beating on
And we'll stand in a canyon alone
Singing our favorite songs
And wait for the words to return in the echo-echo-echo-echo-echo

I wanna get lost with you
And hide out, out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what it's like to spend a whole night with you, just you
With you, just you
With you, just you
With you, just you

And I... wanna get lost...

Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
I wanna get lo-o-o-o-o-ost
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
I wanna get lo-o-o-o-o-ost
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
I wanna get lo-o-o-o-o-ost with you
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what our hearts wanna do
I wanna know what it's like to spend a whole night with you, just you
With you, just you
With you, just you
