Lyrics:


Shadows were hiding what I couldn't see
Out in the dark - she was calling to me
Calling to me with a voice I'd never forget
She was a vision I couldn't believe
I held her close so that she wouldn't leave
Suddenly helpless - hopelessly falling in love

[CHORUS:]
I remember the feeling
I remember the was
She came up and wrapped her arms around me
Told me that she cared
Said she'd always be there
Taking me places that I've never been
She had the beauty that comes from within'
Was dreaming was it too good to be true
I was a man all alone in the night
She came along and she showed me the light
I was confused then she told me the way
I was alone and I begged her to stay She was alive I was caught by the fire
She brought emotions that filled my desire
I should have noticed that something was wrong
When I was awoke she was gone

[CHORUS]

She was alive I was caught by the fire
She brought emotions that filled my desire
I should have noticed that something was wrong
When I awoke, I could see that she was gone
