Lyrics:


Outa my mind I must have been outa my mind
I thought that I'd leave you behind
And never be sorry
Thought I could give you the brush one clean and final break
What's more I left in a rush what difference could it make
Boy was I mistaken

Outa my head I had to be outa my head
'til something inside of me said
You love her like crazy
And I came outa my spin
That dizzy spin I was in
Don't ask me where have I been
Been outa my mind

(Outa my mind I must have been outa my mind)
(I thought that I'd leave you behind)
(And never be sorry)
(Thought I could give you the brush one clean and final break)
(What's more I left in a rush what difference could it make)
(Boy was I mistaken)

Outa my head I had to be outa my head
'til something inside of me said
You love her like crazy
And I came outa my spin
That dizzy spin I was in
(Both) Don't ask me where have I been
(Both) Been outa my mind
