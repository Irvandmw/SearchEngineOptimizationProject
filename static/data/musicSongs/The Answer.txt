Lyrics:


If you're looking for somebody you can talk to 
When the heartache and the troubles overcome you 
There's a man you can count on 
That you can put your problems on 

You've got questions, you need directions 
Arms to hold you for all eternity 
Look no further, because there's no other 
For a lover and an understander 
Jesus is the answer 

You're out there wondering 
What got you into such a big ol' mess 
You've been feeling so undeserving of forgiveness 
But there's a king up on a throne 
That lets you know you're not alone 

You've got questions, you need directions 
Arms to hold you for all eternity 
Look no further, because there's no other 
He's an anchor, he's Gods right hander 
Jesus is the answer 

Sometimes life is a no win situation. 
Get down on your knees and he'll be right there waiting 

You've got questions, you need directions 
Arms to hold you for all eternity 
Look no further, because there's no other 
He's a lover and an understander 
He's an anchor, he's Gods right hander 
Jesus is the answer
