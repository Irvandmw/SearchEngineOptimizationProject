Lyrics:


[Duncan:]
We come from humble beginnings and
Who could have guessed it when
You sit and doubt it and
Things ain't all that bright
But we made it through the night
It's like a game of truth or dare
If you can make it here
You'll make it anywhere
That's what we've been told
But the story's getting old

[Lee:]
Together we faced the cold outside
No one can say we didn't try
And I will never give you up or let you go
Together we faced our final fears
Remember the moments that we shared
That's why I'll never give you up or let you go

[All:]
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
I gotta read between the lines
'Cause I'm living out the script of my life
'Cause we all got a part we must play
And I've done it but I've done it my way
I gotta read between the lines
Oh (oh)
In the script of my life

[Simon:]
We started out many years ago
No one will ever know
How far we've really come
Since we walked away
And no more words to say

[Antony:]
And we made a lot of sacrifice
Undid a lot of ties
Fought a lot of fights
To get where we are now
Just don't ask me how

[Lee:]
Together we faced the cold outside
No one can say we didn't try
And I will never give you up or let you go
Together we faced our final fears
Remember the moments that we shared
That's why I'll never give you up or let you go

[All:]
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
I gotta read between the lines
'Cause I'm living out the script of my life
'Cause we all got a part we must play
And I've done it but I've done it my way
I gotta read between the lines
Oh
In the script of my life

[Simon:]
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
Gotta read between the lines
In the script of my life
We all got a part to play
I've done it but I've done it my way
Gotta read between the lines
In the script of my life

[All:]
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
I gotta read between the lines
'Cause I'm living out the script of my life
'Cause we all got a part we must play
And I've done it but I've done it my way
I gotta read between the lines
Oh (oh)
In the script of my life

[All:]
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
I gotta read between the lines
'Cause I'm living out the script of my life
'Cause we all got a part we must play
And I've done it but I've done it my way
I gotta read between the lines
Oh (oh)
In the script of my life
