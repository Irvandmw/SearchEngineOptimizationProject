Lyrics:


I don't wanna think about nothing
Just watching you dancing
Feel like the beginning of something

In the end, in the end
All I wanna do is just fall in
I don't wanna think about nothing

Everybody got so much to say
Every time we pushing away
Everyday, a new reason to stay

'Cause we got a big love
Won't ever give it up
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
We got a bigger love

I don't wanna think about nothing
The world feels like it's crumbling
Everyday, another new something

But in the end, in the end
Can't nobody do us in
I just wanna think about loving

'Cause we got a bigger love
Won't ever give it up
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
We got a bigger love

We got a bigger love
Won't ever give it up, no
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us

Oh, we got a bigger love
Won't ever give it up
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us

'Cause we got a bigger love
Oh, won't ever give it up, no
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
We got a bigger love
