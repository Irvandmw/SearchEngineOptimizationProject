Lyrics:


Let's put it out there off the muscle
I don't wanna be your friend and I don't trust you
One thing I hate about a sucker
They always end up offended by my hustle

And I put it all on the line every time
I came straight out the struggle
I been through the rain and the pain and the mud
And I brushed off my shoulders like that shit ain't nothin'
I'm poppin' so I'm the topic of discussion
I hit the game so hard, it caught a concussion (Uh)
Never have time to play video games
'Cause I'm too busy chasin' the money
I just hooked up with a lil' bitch
She told that me she love me, I know she don't love me
And I'm still screamin' fuck the police
The PO and the judge until they free my cousin
I stay down and stayed in my lane
And I soaked up the game and gave it to my brother
And now he in the game after me
That's the way it should be, now let's go get the money
And I just caught a package from Cali
I break that shit down and front it to my cousin
I'm not leavin' without that 4-5
If you run up on me, I'm guaranteed to bun you

Let's put it out there off the muscle
I don't wanna be your friend and I don't trust you (Ay ay)
One thing I hate about a sucker
They always end up offended by my hustle

I just got off the phone with my mom and my nieces
I told 'em I love 'em
I'm gon' make it happen, swear I'm gon' keep trappin'
And I'm gon' keep rappin' 'til a nigga bubble
These niggas talk about it, ain't gon' do nothin'
But I'm the opposite, I say it, I done it (Ay)
And I'm prob'ly way up in a condo
My feet on the table, eatin' steak and onions (Mm)
And please do not hand me your mixtape
I don't wanna hear it, your shit is not bumpin' (It's not)
Got her legs on my shoulders, I'm swimmin'
And givin' it to her 'til she say she cummin' (Ay ay ay)
Got a swagger that ain't nobody got
And you fuck niggas hate it, but bitches, they love it (Muah)
And I don't wanna hear that's your bitch
'Cause she wasn't your girl when I gave her my number (Ha)
A lil' word of advice, better keep her off my Instagram
If you think that you love her (Oh yeah)
'Cause I do not have nothin' to hide
I don't keep it on private, I keep it on public (Ay ay)

Let's put it out there off the muscle
I don't wanna be your friend and I don't trust you (Oh yeah)
One thing I hate about a sucker
They always end up offended by my hustle (Ay)

And I put it all on the line every time
I came straight out the struggle
I been through the rain and the pain and the mud
And I brushed off my shoulders like that shit ain't nothin'
I'm poppin' so I'm the topic of discussion
I hit the game so hard, it caught a concussion (Uh)
Never have time to play video games
'Cause I'm too busy chasin' the money (For real)
I just hooked up with a lil' bitch
She told that me she love me, I know she don't love me (Ha)
And I'm still screamin' fuck the police
The PO and the judge until they free my cousin (Yeah yeah)
I stay down and stayed in my lane
And I soaked up the game and gave it to my brother
And now he in the game after me
That's the way it should be, now let's go get the money (Yeah)
And I just caught a package from Cali
I break that shit down and front it to my cousin (Ay)
I'm not leavin' without that 4-5
If you run up on me, I'm guaranteed to bun you (Ay, ay)

Let's put it out there off the muscle
I don't wanna be your friend and I don't trust you
One thing I hate about a sucker
They always end up offended by my hustle

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
