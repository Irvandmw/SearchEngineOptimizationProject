Lyrics:


(Yeah, yeah)
Throw it back, throw it back on me
(Yeah, yeah)
Hit the dash on me (On me)

You don't even know that you're bad (That you're bad)
Anything you want, you can have it
I don't want this thing to go all bad (All bad)
So, do what you wanna do, I ain't mad at you
Ayy, give it time, let you focus (Ooh)
Make, make your ankles touch your shoulders (Ooh)
Pay hunnid thou', just to throw it (Ooh)
Break, money shower, super soaker (Ooh)

What's your name? (What's your name?)
Can I spend some time? (Spend some time)
I'm only here for the night
Fall in love while I eat it up
I'ma fuck it up
Let's play catch up
Ooh, yeah
Weekdays, it's not enough
Weekends be short as fuck
This ain't addin' up
Let's play catch up

Send my love, give it back 'cause you stole it
Give it up, ain't no way to control it
I'm on top, sayin' things I don't mean but
Don't get confused, it's all about you (Ooh)
Ayy, light drip, we can take a trip (Yeah)
Planes, don't care, 80 on my wrist (Yeah)
Ayy, shift gears in my spaceship, yeah
Rain, make you mine and we're out of here (Whoa)

What's your name? (What's your name?)
Can I spend some time? (Spend some time, oh yeah)
I'm only here (I'm only here) for the night (For the night)
Fall in love while I eat it up
I'ma fuck it up
Let's play catch up (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, yeah
Weekdays, it's not enough (Oh)
Weekends be short as fuck (Oh)
This ain't addin' up (Oh no, no, no, no, no)
Let's play catch up

Uh, she don't compare to no one (No, she don't, don't, don't)
Hey body's what I know (Oh-whoa)
You are a fallin' note, girl (Woo, woo)
Let's give it time (Yeah, yeah)
Ayy, give it time, let you focus
Make, make your ankles touch your shoulders (Shoulders)
Pay hunnid thou', just to throw it (Ooh)
Break, money shower, super soaker (Ooh)
Is you with it?
Listen, flip it
Do it, do it, good, good
Pop it, drop it on me, good
Let's play catch up
