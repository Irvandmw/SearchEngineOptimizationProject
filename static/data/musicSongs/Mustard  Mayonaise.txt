Ooh
I'ma hot girl
But these niggas think I'm cool
Partied all night
Then woke up and went to school

A real bad bitch
I look good in a suit
A lil model booty
But that muthafucker move

Ain't a thing you can name that I want and ain't get
Got some head from your nigga then I check that off the list
Make him feel like he my man when he know he just a trick
He be paying this tuition and I never let him hit

Yeah yeah yeah
I'm giving niggas the chills
Sexy like Pamela Grier
Conceited I stay in the mirror
I'm whipping hoes out like it smears

I pull up with Kel in a Benz (skur)
Yo baby daddy get in (mwah)
He wanna lick it again
He spoil me like I'm a lil kid

Panties and the fur pull up with a chauffeur
Peanut butter and sauce like I [?]
I prefer head over sex, cash over checks
If a bitch get me wrong got the auto-correct
Don't swerve but my flow wet, hit a boy vest
If he put me to bed, now he under arrest
Lock it down now that mouth mine, turn him to a mime
He ain't talk in a minute cus his tongue doin time (ahhh)

Look at my phone and the money jus text me
Dinner with the plug
I ain't hungry I'm finessing
Barely speak any English but I know he understand me
Hand over the money cus he know it make me happy

I'ma dream girl but I don't do no singing
Heard he got that work so I put him in a meeting
Say he only eat his girlfriends tryna tease me
But I peeped the mouth so I know he finna drink me

I'ma hot girl
But these niggas think I'm cool
Partied all night
Then woke up and went to school

A real bad bitch
I look good in a suit
A lil model booty
But that muthafucker move

Got more business in your mouth than a dentist
I'm the baddest bitch walkin' round on campus
Some tired niggas on my line 'let the car through'
Got a condo but like to kick it in my dorm room
Hair pulled back no bra in a blazer
Let a nigga know a lil' money don't fade you
If you ain't talking numbers I'ma holla at you later
'Cause I'm into getting money baby I don't wanna lay up

Bitch you a L, I'm a win
Here you can have back your man
He know to stack in a ten
I get more neck than a chin
Yeah I be actin' an ass
I be hungover in class
My professor think I'm bad
So he gon' give me a pass

Ooh
I heard you was a freak I'm tryna see if that shit true
You heard I was a player what that got to do with you?
I'm tryna see wassup with that baby if it's cool (let me know)
Stop actin' like a rookie I know you know what to do

I'm a hot girl
But these niggas think I'm cool
Partied all night
Then woke up and went to school

A real bad bitch
I look good in a suit
A lil model booty
But that muthafucker move
