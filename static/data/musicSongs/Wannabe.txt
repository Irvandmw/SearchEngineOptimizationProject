Lyrics:


How much does fame weigh? A gram

I wannabe famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be famous?
I wannabe famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be-? I be
I wannabe famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be famous?
I wannabe famous, I wanna be famous
I wanna be

I'm just a regular person, so I'm not good enough
No, I'm not good enough, no, I'm not good enough
No, I ain't shit
I don't get likes like they get likes, so I'm gonna slit my fuckin' wrist
I ain't apologizing, inject the collagen, make me feel like I'm in college again (College again)
Who selling fame by the gram? Get me the house without you in my hand (You in my hand)
That social media shit is a contest, if I ain't winning then I am depressed and
I feel less than, I get stressed and, I-I-I-I get stressed like ooh
Why you think Kanye crazy? Why you think YG brazy like 'suwoop'
Why you think ol' boy lying on the internet, no more, motherfuck all of you

I wannabe famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be famous?
I wannabe famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be-? I be
I wannabe famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be famous?
I wannabe famous, I wanna be famous
I wanna be
