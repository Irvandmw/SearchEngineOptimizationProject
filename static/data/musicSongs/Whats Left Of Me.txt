Lyrics:


So this is what it feels like
To get back up when your back's against the wall
And this is what it looks like
When you're all chocked up and you're trying to hide it
I know it doesn't feel right
But you did what you did and I have to end it all
And this is what you get now
When you're caught in the act and you can't deny it

You've done your best
To take what's left

No I won't take all the pieces
Put them back together
You've got the best of me
But I won't give you what's left of me
I won't take the pieces
Put them back together
You took the best of me
You can't have what's left of me

So this is what it feels like
When you're back at the start and both your hands are tied
And this is what it sounds like
When you can't break free but they hear you screaming
And now it doesn't feel right
Because you said what you said and I have to break the ties
I'm looking for a knife now
To cut my losses and stop the bleeding

I've done my best
To save what's left

No I won't take all the pieces
Put them back together
You've got the best of me
But I won't give you what's left of me
I won't take the pieces
Put them back together
You took the best of me
You can't have what's left of me

You can't have what's left of me
You can't have what's left of me
Can't have what's left of me
What's left of me

No I won't take all the pieces
Put them back together
You've got the best of me
But I won't give you what's left of me
I won't take the pieces
Put them back together
You took the best of me
You can't have what's left of me

You can't have what's left of me
