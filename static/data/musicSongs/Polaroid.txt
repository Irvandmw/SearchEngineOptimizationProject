Lyrics:


I'm a reckless mistake
I'm a cold night's intake
I'm a one night too long
I'mma come on too strong

All my life
I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down
I'm a rollin' freight train
One more time
Gotta start all over
Can't slow down
I'm a lone red rover

I'mma hold my cards close
I'mma wreck what I love most
I'm a first-class let-down
I'mma a "shut up, sit down"

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the pay raise
Always a touch out of view
And I am the color of boom

All my life
I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down
I'm a rollin' freight train
One more time
Gotta start all over
Can't slow down
I'm a lone red rover

Oh, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a Polaroid
Better in picture
But never can fill the void

I'm a midnight talker
Oh, I'm an alley walker
I'm a day-late two face
I'm a burn-out quick pace

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the opera
Always on time and in tune
And I am the color of boom

All my life
I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down
I'm a rollin' freight train
One more time
Gotta start all over
Can't slow down
I'm a lone red rover

Oh, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a Polaroid
Better in picture
But never can fill the void

I'm gonna get ready
For the rain to pour heavy
Let it fall, fall
Let it fall upon my head

All my life
I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down
I'm a rollin' freight train
One more time
Gotta start all over
Can't slow down
I'm a lone red rover

Oh, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a Polaroid
Better in picture
But never can fill the void

Oh, love is a Polaroid [4x]
