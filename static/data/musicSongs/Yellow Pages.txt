Lyrics:


I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I canât forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And itâs the worst thing that I did

When I read through you
You werenât translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So Iâd be free from it

See, all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on Iâm back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And itâs the worst thing that I did

When I read through you
You werenât translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So Iâd be free from it
