[Verse 1 - Mac Miller]
Dealing with everybodyâs opinion
Trying to do me
Only down one, Iâm in the final
Shooting threes
Like I donât give a fuck
Music we fuck, switch the position up
We love the things that keep on
Bringing out the kids in us
Been working all my life to do some different stuff
and people have the nerve to say Iâm young and havenât lived enough
Iâm on the road, my girl so sad Iâm gone
Itâs hard when I canât even find the time to call my mom
When she thinks Iâm going Hollywood
I guess she probably should
It seems like people see the bad and donât acknowledge good
I feel the shade but I can see the sun, itâs cool
I got the time to feel the need to run, a fool
Is what Iâve become, young and Iâm dumb
Been spending cake to get some bump in the trunk
Drums with a pump like some Reeboks
See me from the treetops
They worry but they need not
Heating like a teapot
Now I think Iâm cool cause I got a pair of shoes
A more dough, a jacket with a Polo logo
My cup always filled with Henny
So no Four Loco
They should know, so..
I could go slow, you see that Iâm smooth now
Used to ignore me
They study what I do now
With some help from Kweli
And itâs Like on the they
Its cool to say my cypher complete

[Verse 2 - Talib Kweli]
Word. Iâm so sick with the verbs I use
The words to heal us
They love how I kill it on stage, man
Murder theaters
No wonder they call it a book asleep in the coffin
Dead tired
Exhausted from how often I be touring
So gangsta, Like the occupation of Made Men
Creating chaos, my operation is Mayhem
The movie never stopped the frame changeover
We add a Mac to the wolfpack: hangover
That Hen is not a friend
Iâm on that Lager ?
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man
Iâm not a kid no more
Donât want to hold your hand that four loco
make you shoulder lean like a dro fan,
Go ham, like Abraham reading all the signs
Oh yeah, and donât forget to call your moms
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year
Take care of the fam
Cause itâs all we really have here..
