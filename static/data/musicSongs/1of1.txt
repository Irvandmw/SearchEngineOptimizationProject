Hook me up, 4
Baby Jesus
Baby Jesus
They don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
400

You not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion (Not really livin')
I'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business (That ain't none of my business)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
I knew from the beginning you wasn't my nigga, you do too much for some attention (I knew from the beginning)
I can't fuck with these niggas, I can't let 'em trick me, sorry I am no longer friendly (I am no longer friendly)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)

I regret to inform you that I am not normal, sorry, they no longer make 'em like me
I just received a text from my bitch from the west, she said later on she gon' come suck me to sleep
It's a hell of a difference between me and these other niggas, my presence will light up a room
It's almost like magic, but I'm no magician, my music non-fiction, my words are the truth
These niggas be lyin', but that there ain't none of my business
Creating an image that don't even fit 'em
Expressing they feelings in effort to gain some attention
These niggas remind me of bitches
And God is my witness, they exaggeratin'
They imagination is not like the life that they livin'
My worst fear, deep illustrations of my life, it all seem so basic
They stole my appearance (Woo)
My wordplay a barbarage these niggas can't fathom
I just started rappin', I'm rippin' up tracks
Got my foot on the gas and I'm not lookin' back
I'm dropping my nuts on these niggas, I'm applying pressure
Your thoughts are irrelevant, fuck what you telling me
Not playing catch-up, I'm two steps ahead of 'em
Fuck is a soldier compared to a veteran?

You not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion (Not really livin')
I'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business (That ain't none of my business)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
I knew from the beginning you wasn't my nigga, you do too much for some attention (I knew from the beginning)
I can't fuck with these niggas, I can't let 'em trick me, sorry I am no longer friendly (I am no longer friendly)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)

I had to slow down on the second verse, my vocab might be too exquisite
For most of these basic ass niggas to listen, they don't understand it, they won't pay attention
The same conversation held with different women (Keep it pimpin'), give the best advice that I can give 'em (Keep it pimpin')
I tried to tell 'em I was different but most of them hoes ain't understand the difference
One of a kind, you'll find a nigga like John, let me meet him (I wanna meet him)
I tell my bitches all of the time that I'm not a cheater (I'm not a cheater)
And they believe me, got 'em calling me Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)
That lil' nigga that sold the Impala and bought the Beamer (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
And that beamer got a whole lotta hoes on it (Them hoes)
I set the trend I was the first one with the gold on it
And them niggas lyin' if they tell you otherwise
I'm one of one, not like them other guys
Pay too much attention to niggas opinion
Discussing they business, what the fuck kind of life you livin'?

You not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion (Not really livin')
I'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business (That ain't none of my business)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
I knew from the beginning you wasn't my nigga, you do too much for some attention (I knew from the beginning)
I can't fuck with these niggas, I can't let 'em trick me, sorry I am no longer friendly (I am no longer friendly)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)
You not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion
I'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more
I knew from the beginning you wasn't my nigga, you do too much for some attention
I can't fuck with these niggas, I can't let 'em trick me, sorry I am no longer friendly
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more
