Lyrics:


I don't care about what you think of me
Got too much on my mind to hear you speak
I don't need to hear what's on your mind
Don't waste your breath
If you don't like me it's not my fault
At all, just another opinion
Another opinion

I don't even notice you
How am I upsetting you?
No one wants your point of view
I can't hear you, can't hear you at all
Lemme hear you say

Why you mad, are you bored, tryna mess with me?
You don't know me, how you think you know what's best for me?
Probably hate me 'cause you love me, you obsessed with me
If you don't like me it's not my fault
No, not at all
Just another opinion

I don't care 'bout what you think of me
Got too much on my mind to hear you speak
I don't need to hear what's on your mind
Don't waste your breath
If you don't like me it's not my fault
At all, just another opinion

Think before you talk to me
Remember what your momma said
If you got nothin' nice to say
Don't say it, don't say it at all, no, no
Lemme hear you say

Why you mad, are you bored, tryna mess with me?
You don't know me, how you think you know what's best for me?
Probably hate me 'cause you love me, you obsessed with me
If you don't like me it's not my fault
No, not at all
Just another opinion
(Lemme hear you say)

I don't care 'bout what you think of me
Got too much on my mind to hear you speak (hear you speak, no)
I don't need to hear what's on your mind (on your mind, babe)
Don't waste your breath
If you don't like me it's not my fault
At all, it's just another opinion

I don't care 'bout what you think of me (think of me)
Got too much on my mind to hear you speak (you speak)
I don't need to hear what's on your mind (on your mind)
Don't waste your breath
If you don't like me it's not my fault
At all, it's just another opinion

If you don't like me it's not my fault
Not at all, it's just another opinion
