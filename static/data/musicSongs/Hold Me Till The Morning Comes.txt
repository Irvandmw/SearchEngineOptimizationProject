Lyrics:


Two broken hearts
Neither one knows what to say
Both falling from love,
But not quite all the way
Look at us now
We're reachin' back for yesterday
Wanting to know,
If the other wants to stay
After all,
I'm the one who said we're through
Now I can't live without you, anymore
Out there lost,
Is a dream that can come true
Is it worth the reachin' for...?
Don't you want me anymore...?

Darlin',
Hold me till the mornin' comes
Until I see you smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the mornin' sun
Let me stay we've just begun
Ooh....

Where shall we start...?
A tender word that we can share
And if we believe,
In time we will get there
Look at us now,
Wanting more than words can say
Both falling in love
But this time all the way
Out there lost,
Are the words "I still love you"
Are they worth the reachin' for...?
Do you love me anymore...?

Darlin'
Hold me till the mornin' comes
Until I see you smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the mornin' sun
Let me stay, we've just begun
I want to stay with you

Hold me till the mornin' comes
Until I see you smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the mornin' sun
Let me stay, we've just begun
I want to stay with you

Would you love me in the mornin'...?
Will you still be there in the mornin'...?
Or would you leave without a warnin'...?
Say you love me too

Would you love me in the mornin'...?
Will you still be there in the mornin'...?
Or would you leave without a warnin'...?
Say you love me too
[Repeat to fade]
