Lyrics:


They just keep holdin' me
A-won't let go
Holdin' me
Won't let go

I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram them down

They just keep teasin' me
And, you know, they play like they don't know
Provokin me
But this is all I know

I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram them down
I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down

Oh, I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram-a them-a down
Oh, I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down

Said, I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram-a them down
I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down

Holdin' me (ooh...)
Won't let go (ooh...)
Holdin' me (ooh...)
Won't let go (ooh...)
I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram-a them down
I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
(I need a rammer)

I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram them down

I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram them down
