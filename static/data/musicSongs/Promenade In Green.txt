Lyrics:


Tracy, come out and play
Red light, green light and I'll be it today
'Cause it's a green rocky road
Promenade in green
Tell me who y'all love
Tell me who y'all love

Right foot up, left foot down
Red light, green light around the town
England, Greenland, France and Spain
Around the world and back again
'Cause it's a green rocky road
Promenade in green
Tell me who y'all love
Tell me who y'all love

Up the street, around the square
Gunnar and Mathew are already there
Here comes Danny and Jamie too
Count to ten, we'll come a lookin' for you
'Cause it's a green rocky road
Promenade in green
Tell me who y'all love
Tell me who y'all love
