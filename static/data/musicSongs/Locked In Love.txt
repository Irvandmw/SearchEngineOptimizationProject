Lyrics:


I'm losing my way
Can somebody find the key?
Cause I'm stuck in this locket of love
It's your enemy
And I know what's right
So Imma put that aside
And I'll wait for the right guy

Oh but I'm locked in love
I'm locked in love
Oh, I said I'm locked in love
Oh but I'm locked in love
I gotta break away
Cause I'm locked in love babe oh

I'm losing my way
Can somebody help me please?
Cause my heart says no
But my feet won't go
Tell me what is happening
And I know what's right
But I just can't decide (Can't decide)
If I should stay by your side

Oh but I'm locked in love
I gotta break away
Cause I'm locked in love baby
Oh, I'm locked in love
Yes I'm locked in love
Don't know which way to go
Cause I'm locked in love

And if I can't decide
By tonight I promise to you
It'll be okay
It'll be alright

Locked in love
Oh, I'm locked
I'm locked in love
I'm locked in love
I'm locked in love
I gotta break away
Cause I'm locked in love oh
Locked in love
I'm locked in love
I'm locked in love
I'm locked in love
I'm locked in love
I'm locked in love
I'm locked in love
I'm locked in love
