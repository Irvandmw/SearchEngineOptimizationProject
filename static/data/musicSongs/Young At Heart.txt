Lyrics:


[instrumental verse]

Fairy tales can come true, 
It can happen to you, 
If you're young at heart! 

(Young at heart!) 

For it's hard you will find 
To be narrow of mind, 
If you're young at heart! 

(Young at heart!) 

You can go to extremes, 
With impossible schemes, 
You can laugh when your dreams 
Fall apart at the seams... 

And life gets more exciting, 
With each passing day, 
An' love is either in your heart, 
Or, on the way! 

Don't you know that it's worth, 
Every treasure on earth, 
To be young at heart! 

(Young at heart!) 

For as rich as you are, 
It's much better by far, 
To be young at heart! 

(Young at heart!) 

And if you should survive, 
To a hundred an' five, 
Look at all you'll derive 
Outta bein' alive! 

And here is the best part, 
You have a head start... 
If you are among, 
The very young at heart! 

(Don't you know that it's worth, 
Every treasure on earth, 
To be young at heart! 
For as rich as you are, 
It's much better by far, 
To be young at heart!) 

And if you should survive, 
To a hundred an' five, 
Look at all you'll derive 
Outta bein' alive! 

And here is the best part, 
You have a head start... 
If you are among, 
The very young... 
at heart!
