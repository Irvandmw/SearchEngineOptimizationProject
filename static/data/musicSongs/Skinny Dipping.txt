Lyrics:


Sometimes, I get so blind that I can't see
Just who I want myself to be,
And when I look deep in your eyes
I see that you've been telling lies
And I don't want to anymore...
No I don't want to anymore...
No I don't want to anymore...
And sometimes I turn around and walk away 
When I've got nothing left to say
And all those times I wonder why
Good girls should never make you cry
And I don't want to anymore...
No I don't want to anymore...
No I don't want to anymore...
No I don't want to anymore...
Sometimes you make me feel so good it hurts
Wish I had gotten to you first
You know how hard it is to say
These words that make you run away
And I don't want to anymore...
No I don't want to anymore
No I don't want to anymore...
No I don't want to anymore...
