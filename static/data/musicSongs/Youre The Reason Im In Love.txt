Lyrics:


(You're the reason you're the reason you're the reason I'm in love)
You're the reason I'm in love you're my shining star above
You're my every dream come true that's why I love you like I do
Adam shared his love with Eve some may doubt but I believe
I would give my life for you that's why I love you like I do
(I would give my life for you) that's why I love you like I do
You're the reason I'm in love...
Yes you're the reason I'm in love
