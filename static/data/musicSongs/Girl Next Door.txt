Lyrics:


Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again
In a magazine
We laughed out loud
'Cause she said "remember when...
This was all a silly dream?"
Now I wake up every day
In a different city
A smile on my face
Somebody pinch me
She said "all the world's a stage"
But girl you know
Those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink a beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into blue jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

It's amazin' to hear people singin' along
Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight
Now every now and then
On a Friday night
Cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend Saturday sleepin' in late
Yeah, those were the good days

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink a beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into blue jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink a beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into blue jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
