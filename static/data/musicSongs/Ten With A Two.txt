Lyrics:


[Verse 1]
Last night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light
I lost my eyesight
I ain't been that drunk in awhile
Along about 1 I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
Aw, she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I died and gone to heaven
But lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

[Chorus]
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But lord when I do I lose
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

[Verse 2]
Well I made up my mind
I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same barstool
And just look at the shape I'm in
I done spotted me another queen
Sitting at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes, I thought I'd been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

[Chorus]
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But lord when I do I lose
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Now you may laugh
But if you've got the cash
I'll bet you 10 to 1 you have too
