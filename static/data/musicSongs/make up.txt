Lyrics:


Layinâ on the couch just,
hanginâ with my boys
weâre chillinâ up the house tonight
Iâm being myself
Iâm nobody else âcause
this is what we do alright
youâll always find

[Chorus]
Iâm not wearing any make-up,
wonât hide who I am,
Iâll be what I am
Iâm just being honest with my self once again
Iâm my only friend

Kickinâ off my shoes
Iâm strumminâ my guitar
Iâm singinâ songs about my life
if I could tell the truth
Iâd tell you what I meant by
me, myself, and I
youâll always find

[Chorus]

No more mirrors
no more vanity
give it all away for free
donate to charity
I am happy in my skin
I try, in my heart it's not the same
youâll always find

[Chorus]

Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,
lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,
lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,
lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight
