Lyrics:


It matters what you do
Matters what you say
It matters that you lead the way
It matters what you think
It matters what you know
There is no other place to go

For this is our home
This is our home
This is where we belong

It matters what you say
Matters what you do
It matters what I put you through

For this is our home
This is our home
This is the place

Hey, this is our home
This is our home
This is the place where we belong

For this is our home
This is our home
This is where we belong
