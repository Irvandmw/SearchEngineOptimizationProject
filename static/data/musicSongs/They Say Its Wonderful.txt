Lyrics:


They say that falling in love is wonderful 
It's wonderful, so they say 
And with the moon up above 
It's wonderful, it's wonderful, so they tell me! 

I can't recall who said it, I know I never read it 
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and  
The thing that's known as romance is wonderful  
Wonderful, in every way, so they say!
