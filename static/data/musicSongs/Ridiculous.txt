Lyrics:


This love that I'm feeling
Is not like another feeling, I know
I can't explain it, oh
This love that you give me
Is making me feel things I don't know, no, no
Boy, you make me feel so good
It's so special, special to me
So good
You're the element I needed, hey
You're super cool
Can't make me let you go
You take my breath away
It's like you cast a spell on me
(Ridiculous love)

This is ridiculous
This is ridiculous
This is ridiculous
This is ridiculous

If I go a day without you
I know you're thinking of me
Wondering what I'm doing
Wondering what I'm thinking
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
Boy, you know you're my baby, baby
All I see is you, standing right there
Looking so sexy, baby, hey
Now you got me feeling, feeling, feeling
Like loving on you, and touching you
I'mma seduce you, baby, baby
It's like you cast a spell on me
(Ridiculous love)

This is ridiculous
This is ridiculous
This is ridiculous
This is ridiculous

I love you, you love me
We should be together
Ridiculous
Boy, boy, boy
Boy, don't you know you're a star
Hope you don't wreck my heart

This is ridiculous...
