Lyrics:


I'm saucing, yeah I'm saucing on your main ho
Talking, boy stop talking, I don't play, no
I said run it up, that's what, that's what we do
Ran off on the plug, that's a lick, I don't see you
I'm saucing, yeah I'm saucing on your main ho
Talking, boy stop talking, I don't play, no
I said run it up, that's what, that's what we do
Ran off on the plug, that's a lick, I don't see you

All these niggas asking for some handouts, yeah
All these niggas asking what are you 'bout, umm
All these niggas asking, they won't shoot out
If I want it I do it, don't play it now
Getting bigger, now they asking for a shoutout
I did it on my own, nigga get out
Niggas flaking 'bout this shit, they be lyin' when they spit
They be spying on my shit, that's why they sound just like my hits
Black flag, G's up, you a wannabe
Long MAC, force up, keep it next to me
What you doin'? I said umm-umm what you doin'?
Got a zip just to flip it, now we back seat zoomin'
My new bitch, she be on that bougie shit, can't top it
Know she ride around in that Benz, she can drop it
Know some niggas folking in the south and they pop it
Six-triple-oh, ABF, bitch stop talkin'

I'm saucing, yeah I'm saucing on your main ho
Talking, boy stop talking, I don't play, no
I said run it up, that's what, that's what we do
Ran off on the plug, that's a lick, I don't see you
I'm saucing, yeah I'm saucing on your main ho
Talking, boy stop talking, I don't play, no
I said run it up, that's what, that's what we do
Ran off on the plug, that's a lick, I don't see you

Saucing, I don't like niggas who be jogging
'Cause we mobbing and you know we not stopping
I said we popping, yeah we popping
And we dropping, too much fucking hits, and they topping
I don't answer no shit, umm-umm
Now they hit me up just to hit a lick, umm-umm
Now they hit me up 'cause they tryna get some dick, umm-ya
Ayy, yeah-eah
They say you should quit, no I'm feelin' that shit
But then I made a hit and now these niggas on my dick
Tryna hit my Snap but I don't really like that shit
So if I don't hit your line you should know just how it is
Money goin' fast and my fame is going too
I seen just how they living and I said I want that too
Balmain with the rips, yes I got some brand new
See my life flippin', now they tryna come too, ooh

I'm saucing, yeah I'm saucing on your main ho
Talking, boy stop talking, I don't play, no
I said run it up, that's what, that's what we do
Ran off on the plug, that's a lick, I don't see you
I'm saucing, yeah I'm saucing on your main ho
Talking, boy stop talking, I don't play, no
I said run it up, that's what, that's what we do
Ran off on the plug, that's a lick, I don't see you

Saucing, yeah I'm saucing, yeah I'm saucing
Yeah, I don't see you
Ayy, ayy, said I'm saucing
