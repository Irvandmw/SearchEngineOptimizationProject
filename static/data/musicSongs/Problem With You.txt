Lyrics:


D.A. got that dope

Friday, Saturday, Sunday night
Only girls in the crib if they 'bout that life (Yeah)
Twenty-twenty-five, is the usual
And I'm a young nigga with 'em, livin' my best life (Oh)
Phone ring, I don't really think about it (No)
It's too late to talk about it
If you ain't tryna get dicked down
That's fine but

My only problem with you is
You call me late and never come over
Why you gotta cap?
It's 3:30
And I'm horny and thirsty
So why-y-y-y
Why you be hittin' my line up?
Please don't waste my time (Time)
You're too damn fine for me not to pick up

Two missed calls from a bad bitch
Slide in the DM, I'ma smash it (Yeah)
4 AM, why're you playin' catfish?
You know you ain't gon' drive
You're playin' with my mind again
A nigga tryna get some head
New gifts from you in my bed
Thinkin' what I'm 'bout to do with your legs
But I know you ain't comin' so my

My only problem with you is (Only problem is)
You call me late and never come over
Why you gotta cap? (Oh-whoa)
It's 3:30 (Oh-whoa)
And I'm horny and thirsty
So why-y-y-y
Why you be hittin' my line up?
Please don't waste my time (My time)
You're too damn fine for me not to pick up

Don't know why you play with me
You can really get e-everything
Head to toe, I'ma lick you up and down
Have you ever tried the sex swing? (Ooh)
Next best thing
Don't text me
If you ain't talkin' sex, I won't listen (Ooh)
I'm too fade, too faded
And you're playing now

My only problem with you is (Oh)
You call me late and never come over (Ooh, baby)
Why you gotta cap?
It's 3:30 (30)
And I'm horny (Horny) and thirsty (Ooh)
So why-y-y-y (Why?)
Why you be hittin' my line up? (Oh)
Please don't waste my time (My time)
And you're too damn fine for me not to pick up
