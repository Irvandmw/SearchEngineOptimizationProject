Lyrics:


[Brian]
(Ooooo, yeah)
I don't think I want this anymore
As she drops her ring to the floor
She says to herself you've left before, (yeah)
This time you will stay gone that's for sure, (yeah)

[Nick]
And he shattered something else
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car she said

[Chorus: all]
No, happily never after
That just ain't for me, because finally
I know, I deserve better after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall
(Faaaaaaallll)

[AJ]
As she drove away she starts to smile, (yeah) 
Realized she hadn't for awhile
No destination she drove for miles
Wondering why she stayed in such denial

[Nick]
She was laughing about the way he shattered something else
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car she said

[Chorus: all]
No, happily never after
That just ain't for me, (that just ain't for me)
Because finally
I know, I deserve better after all, (that just ain't for me yeah)
I'll never let another teardrop fall

[Howie]
I'm done, I'm done, said I'm so done (so done yeah)
I'm free, I'm free, (so free)
Free to feel the way I feel, yeah
She inhales a breath she never breathed before
Don't want no drama no more

[Brian]
Cause she says no 
Happily never after (after)
That just ain't for me (oh, oh)

[Chorus: all]
I know, I deserve better after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall (I'm done, I'm done)
No happily never after, that just aint for me, (I'm free, I'm free) because finally
I know I deserve better after all
I'll never let another tear drop fall
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, so done, I'm done, so done
Said I'm done, I'm done, I'm done
