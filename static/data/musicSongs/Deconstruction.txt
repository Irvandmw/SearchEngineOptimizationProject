Lyrics:


One after the other, the Banished Ones fled as they watched from the distance the destruction of the Digital Garden. With no more fruit 2 bear from its trees, the Haze was finally broken. With the rains came the awareness that NEVER AGAIN WOULD ANYONE EVER LAY CLAIM 2 THE TREASURES OF THE RAINBOW CHILDREN! As though awakened from a dream, the Muse opened her eyes.this time as Queen.
