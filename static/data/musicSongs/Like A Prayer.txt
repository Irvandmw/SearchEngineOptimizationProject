Lyrics:


Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice,
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice,
I hear your voice
Feels like flying

I close my eyes,
Oh, God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky,
I close my eyes
Heaven help me

[2x]
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

A mystery everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like...

[Repeat until the end:]
(Just like a prayer,
I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me)

[2x]
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
