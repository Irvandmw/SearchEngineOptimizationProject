Lyrics:


It's 4 in the morning and I can't help but think about you
Got my mind running, too soon
Don't want to make it really clear that I'm fallen' for you
I like to hide a secret or too
And when it's out, it never comes back, like a train on tracks
Feelin' wrong along the trails
Soon everybody knows

I wanna hide, hide all my love
Save it for when tomorrow comes
I wanna hide, hide either way until you say
That it's ok

I'm gonna hide, hide all my love
Save it for when tomorrow comes
I'm gonna hide, hide either way until you say
That it's ok

How can I comprehend what's goin' on?
Can't continue this mess for too long
What's the use in hidden' it in?
All it does is cause pain and suffering

When it's out, it'll never come back
Like a train on tracks
Feelin' wrong alone the way
Soon everybody hears

I'm gonna hide, hide all my love
Save it for when tomorrow comes
I'm gonna hide, hide either way until you say
That it's ok

I wanna hide, hide all my love
Save it for when tomorrow comes
I'm gonna hide, hide either way until you say
That it's ok

La la la la la la la la la la la la yeah yeah yeah yeah
La la la la la la la la la la la la yeah yeah yeah yeah
La la la la la la la la la la la la yeah yeah yeah yeah
La la la la la la la la la la la la yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm gonna hide, hide all my love
Save it for when tomorrow comes
I'm gonna hide, hide either way until you say
That it's ok

I'm gonna hide, hide all my love
Save it for when tomorrow comes
I'm gonna hide, hide either way until you say
That it's ok
