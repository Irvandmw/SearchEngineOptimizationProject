Lyrics:


When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world.
It's the end of a world that you had with a girl.
Though it's hard to admit that the memory's sad
when you think what you had, when a good thing goes bad.

Love is so strange, it's a mystery to me.
It's easy to change and to lose what could be.
So you wait and you watch for the one who'll agree
with the things that you need and the life that you lead.

When a good thing goes right, it's a joy beyond worth.
As the roots of your love intertwine with the earth.
And your bodies are one, but you're living for two
and your future looks bright, oh yes, when a good thing goes right.

But time is the test, like the sea pounds the rocks.
And those who love best sometimes fail with the shocks.
And the waves break you down and you watch your love drown.
And she's so far from reach as you stand on the beach.

When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world.
It's the end of a world that you had with a girl.
Though it's hard to admit that the memory's sad
when you think what you had, when a good thing goes bad.
