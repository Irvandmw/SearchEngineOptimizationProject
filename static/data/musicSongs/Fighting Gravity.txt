Lyrics:


Hey yeah, no

You used to hold me too tight (Woah)
It was love at first sight (Woah)
But once we said our goodbyes (Woah)
I tried to find a new guy

The first one took me out and made me pay
Sorry, but that's not okay
No one does it quite like you
Woah, like you do

But tryna stay away is like fighting gravity
And I'm not sure you know what your love does to me
And when I'm where I should be, you knock me off my feet
I'll try to stay away, eh aye
But it's like fighting gravity (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh aye)
It's like fighting gravity (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh aye, yeah)

(Aye!)
We were cute as can be (Woah)
And everybody could see (Woah)
But since you kissed me goodbye (Woah)
I had to find a new guy (Hey!)

The next one held my hand and opened doors
Frankly I was way too bored
'Cuz no one makes me laugh like you (Woah)
Like you do

But tryna stay away is like fighting gravity
And I'm not sure you know what your love does to me
And when I'm where I should be, you knock me off my feet
I'll try to stay away, eh aye
But it's like fighting gravity (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh aye)
It's like fighting gravity (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh aye, yeah)

(Hey!)
Yo, I'm tryna turn my life around
But every time I get up, you bring me down
'Cuz I remember every memory I have with you
But it was just a dream, nah, not coming true
And yes, I dated, yup yup I dated
And they were cute and all
But I couldn't fake it
In comparison, none could compete with you
And what am I to do? (Hey!)

But tryna stay away is like fighting gravity
And I'm not sure you know what your love does to me (Love does to me)
And when I'm where I should be, you knock me off my feet
I'll try to stay away, eh aye
But it's like fighting gravity (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh aye)
It's like fighting gravity (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh aye, yeah)
But it's like fighting gravity (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh aye)
It's like fighting gravity (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh aye, yeah)
(Fighting gravity)
