Lyrics:


I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, I
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell Yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm

We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry
But now I think that we should stay

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm

I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, I don't care
I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, yeah

'Cause I don't care
When I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
When I'm with my baby, yeah
