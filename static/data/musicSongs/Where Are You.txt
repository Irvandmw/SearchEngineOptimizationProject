Lyrics:


Where, where are you?
Where have you gone without me?
I thought you cared about me
Where, where are you?

Whereâs my heart?
Where is the dream we started?
Oh, I just canât believe that weâre parted
Where, where are you?

When we said goodbye love, was it just a game?
And when I gave you my love, was it all in vain?

All life through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is, where is, where is my happy ending?
Where, where are you?

When we said goodbye love, was it just, was it just a game?
And when I gave you my love, was it all in vain?

All night through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is, where is my happy, happy ending?
Where, oh, where, oh, where, honey where are you?
