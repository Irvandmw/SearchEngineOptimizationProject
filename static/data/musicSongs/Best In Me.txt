Lyrics:


From the moment I met you
I just knew you'd be mine
You touched my hand
And I knew that this was gonna be our time

I don't ever wanna lose this feeling
I don't wanna spend a moment apart

'Cause you bring out the best in me
Like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side
And that's why I love you

Every day that I'm here with you
I know that it feels right (so right, so right)
And I've just got to be near
You every day and every night (every night)

And you know that we belong together
It just had to be you and me

'Cause you bring out the best in me
Like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side
And that's why I love you

And you know that we belong together
It just had to be you and me

'Cause you bring out the best in me
Like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side

'Cause you bring out the best in me
Like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side
And that's why I love you

Baby

'Cause you bring out the best in me
Like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side
And that's why I love you
