Lyrics:


I know, you belong to somebody new
But tonight you belong to me
Although, we're apart, you're a part of my heart
And tonight you belong to me

Wait down by the stream
How sweet it will seem
Once more just to dream
In the moonlight

My honey I know
With the dawn that you will be gone
But tonight you belong to me
But tonight you belong to me
Just to little old me!
