Lyrics:


Have you ever been in love?
You could touch the moonlight.
When your heart is shooting stars,
You're holding heaven in your arms.
Have you ever been so in love?

Have you ever walked on air?
Ever felt like you were dreaming?
When you never thought it could,
But it really feels that good.
Have you ever been so in love?

Have you ever been in love?
You could touch the moonlight.
When your heart is shooting stars,
You're holding heaven in your arms.
Have you ever been in love?
Have you?

The time I spent
Waiting for something
That was heaven-sent.
When you find it, don't let go.
I know.

Have you ever said a prayer
And found that it was answered?
All my hope has been restored,
And I ain't looking anymore.
Have you ever been so in love?
Have you?

Some place that you ain't leaving,
Somewhere you're gonna stay,
When you finally found the meaning.
Have you ever felt this way?

The time I spent
Waiting for something
That was heaven-sent.
When you find it, don't let go.
I know.

'Cause have you ever been in love?
So in love.
You can touch the moonlight.
You can even reach the stars.
Doesn't matter near or far.
Have you ever been so in love?

I said:
'Cause have you ever been in love?
Have you ever been in love?
So in love.
