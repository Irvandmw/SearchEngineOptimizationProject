Lyrics:


G-Girl, you got to feel good, feel good
Girl, you got to feel good

I see you drinkin' out the bottle, baby
And then you think of me, it drives you crazy
Tell me, who else can set your soul on fire?
My love is up there, let me take you higher (Higher)

Tell me, does it feel good when I'm touchin' you, you?
'Cause it feels good when you touchin' on me
Does it feel good? (Fell good) Touchin' you
Tell me, does it feel good?

I wanna know what's on your mind
I'm runnin' outta time (Yeah)
I wanna know what's on your mind
I'm runnin' outta time (Ooh-ooh)
Please, please, please, please (Yeah)
Tell me what do you see
Terminator? Bad machine?

Hop on my elevator, let's just go up
You wanna say no but your heart is sold (Hey)
Tell me, who else can get your blood running?
They wanna stop, hell no, let's keep it going (Here we go)

Tell me, does it feel good (Does it feel good?) when I'm touchin' you, you?
'Cause it feels good (Oh) when you touchin' on me
Does it feel good? (Fell good) Touchin' you
Tell me, does it feel good?

I wanna know what's on your mind (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outta time (Yeah)
I wanna know what's on your mind (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outta time (Ooh-ooh)
Please, please, please, please (Yeah)
Tell me what do you see
Terminator? Bad machine?

You are the girl I've been dreaming of (Of, of)
How far would you go just to have my love?
Sometimes, I love you, can't tell when it's coming (No, no)
Right here in front of you, you gotta stop running (Here we go)
Before you lose it, oh yeah, oh yeah
Before you lose it (Ooh-ooh), oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh!

I wanna know what's on your mind (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outta time
I wanna know what's on your mind (Woo!)
I'm runnin' outta time
Please, please, please, please (Yeah)
Tell me what do you see (Ooh-ooh)
Terminator? Bad machine?
Terminator? Bad machine?
