Lyrics:


You are tough with your head held high, no one can deny
And you are proud, silence speaks out loud your confidence showing
One man with a flame within his hands, you set your goals
With much love to help you fly
This is your time, stand strong and go

You're the kind of man that every little boy looks up to and wants to be
You always understand the flipside of the coin and naturally

Hey kids like to talk to you, and honey I do too, you've got so much to say
Your universe all in your stock within with a smile should take you a long way
What I call a real man, you shout to because you take the stand
And then you give it, you give it everything that you got
Give more took yourself and respect your fellow man, oh

You are the kind of man that every little boy looks up to and wants to be
You always understand the flipside of the coin and honey naturally, naturally
You are the kind of man that every little boy looks up to and wants to be
You always understand the flipside of the coin and honey naturally, naturally
