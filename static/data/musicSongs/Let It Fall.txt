Lyrics:


There's a star in you that wants to shine 
But you leave it in a world that's full of darkness 
No matter what you do there's still no light 
Even though you feel you've tried your hardest 
But don't you hide it 
Don't try to fight it 

cos you can't stop the rain if 
It's already falling 
You can't stop the dream when 
It's already calling out your name 
If you give with all your heart 
You will live to see it all 
You can't stop the rain 

So let it fall 

Oh oh, oh oh 

Destiny has made of many things 
Everybody wants what they don't have, ah ah 
No one really knows how long it takes 
Time can make it hard to stay on high 
But don't you fake it 
One day you'll make it 

You can't stop the rain if 
It's already falling 
You can't stop the dream when 
It's already calling out your name 
If you give with all your heart 
You will live to see it all 
You can't stop the rain 

So let it fall 

Fall against your
face against your skin
you feel the rush 
And you begin to see the light of who you are 

cos you can't stop the rain if 
It's already falling 
You can't stop the dream when 
It's already calling out your name 
If you give with all your heart (all your heart) 
You will live to see it all 
You can't stop the rain 

So let it fall (fall) 

So let it fall (fall) 

If you give with all your heart (all your heart) 
You will live to see it all 

You can't stop the rain 
Even if we try 
You can't stop the rain 

So let it fall 

Let it fall
