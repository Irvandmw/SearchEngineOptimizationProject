Lyrics:


You said, "Darling, who you praying to?
Was anybody answering you?
Because I've done my part for twelve years now
And I can't seem to get through"

He said, "I really don't care if you cut your hair
And I really wouldn't mind if we don't go anywhere
Cause I've got you, yeah, I've got you now
I've got you"

And you think my bruised knees are sort of pretty
And I think your tired eyes are kind of nice
And when I first met you, there was a garden
Growing from a black hole in my mind

He said, "Darling, what's it coming to?
And have you got a lighter on you?
Been trying put these down for ages now
But I can't seem to come through"

He said, "I really don't mind if we take our time
Cause I've got a couple bottles of your favorite wine
Cause I've got you, yeah, I've got you now
I've got you"

And you think my bruised knees are sort of pretty
And I think your tired eyes are kind of nice
And when I first met you, there was a garden
Growing from a black hole in my mind

Said I love everything that you've got, boy
Tell me, would you be mine?
Be mine, be mine
Sick, sweet nothing's you're tryna talk, boy
Tell me would you be mine?
Be mine, be mine

And you think my bruised knees are sort of pretty
And I think your tired eyes are kind of nice
And when I first met you, there was a garden
Growing from a black hole in my mind
