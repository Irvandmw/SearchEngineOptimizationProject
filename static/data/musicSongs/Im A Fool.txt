Lyrics:


You know where I can be found, don't you know
I'll be a waiting by the telephone girl
While you're out running around, yeah
I'm sittin' here all alone
And I'm a fool
Just a silly fool to be in love with you

You can't be kind to me girl
Ya always treat me bad girl
But I can't let you go, I know
It would only make me sad
Well I'm a fool
Just a silly fool to be in love with you

You treat me just like dirt
You have all the fun I stay at home and hurt

Baby I wish I knew, yeah
How to get you off my mind girl
To put you down and say we're through, yeah
I think about you all the time
And I'm a fool
Just a silly fool to be in love with you

Baby I'm a fool, to be in love with
Well, I'm a fool, to be in love with
