Lyrics:


[Future:]
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
When I slide in her like butter she come like a Hellcat
Every time she step out the house she bring a check back

Show my chain some love, yeah
Come Show My Chain Some Love, uh
Come give my rings a hug (come give my rings a hug)
Come give my rings a hug, yuh

Come show my rings some love, come kiss my chains
When you start comin' on me, just say my name
Come with me to paradise, takin' all my jewels
Ten chains on my neck, feel bullet proof
Don't let them broke bitches get you, don't let them do it
I was in the ghost like Casper then hopped in the Porsche
16 passenger jet, it hold me and all my comrades
We got tigers for pets, got a Bugatti in my bookbag
Show my watch love show then you gotta my wrist love too
I took a piss in we coupe, I didn't deny it
I got the cash on me and I can't hide it
After you ride it

Show my chain some love, yeah
Come show my chain some love yeah
Come give my rings a hug (come give my rings a hug)
Come give my rings a hug, yuh

[Young Thug:]
[?] it's dangerous
If I fuck on a thot she gotta be Blue Flamin' up
I'm in the executive with the Redskins
Blood out, blood in, yeah the bangers
So much money on me right now I could buy you the world
I got two model bitches I make 'em merge
I told her everything, [?]
Come on darling, just make 'em swerve
Diamond clean, no rub
If it's CelinÃ¨ ain't worth
We ain't tired of fuckin', put your heart on me
Show my chain some love

[Future:]
Show my chain some love
Come show my chain some love yeah
Come give my rings a hug
Come give my rings a hug
Come give my rings a hug, yuh
