Lyrics:


Iâve got issues, so does everyone.
That never stopped you
from sleeping with this loaded gun.
Iâm sorry for everything I have done (everything I have done).

And now youâre telling me
that I am the one that wonât amount to no good.
Iâd never die for you, not even if I could.
And I am the one thatâs always misunderstood.
Iâd never die for you, even if I could.
Die for you, you know I never would.

Mommyâs little monster,
wrapped inside a box.
Canât forgive her,
she threw away the fucking key.
Iâll haunt her for the rest of her life (for the rest of her life).

Youâre always telling me
that I am the one that wonât amount to no good.
Iâd never die for you, not even if I could.
And I am the one the one thatâs always misunderstood.
Iâd never die for you, even if I could.
Die for you, you know I never would.

You know that I can never forgive you.
You wear it out.
You break me down (you break me down).

Youâre always telling me
that I am the one that wonât amount to no good.
Iâd never die for you, not even if I could.
And I am the one the one thatâs always misunderstood.
Iâd never die for you, even if I could.
Die for you, you know I never would.

You know, you know I never would.
You know, you know I never would.
You know, you know I never would.
You know, you know I never would.
