Lyrics:


La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
Some people go through life like it's a breeze
They float their way through days
And never feel the grey
And their tears fall
But they don't sting
Their temporary marks
Not always from the heart
They live lightly
Breathe so easy
No digging in
To what's within

[Chorus]
No work all play
What a mistake
Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky
Get that melancholy feel inside and
Work on yourself
Don't run from the pain you felt
You don't have to slide
Life's not one big high

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
Sometimes it's hard lookin' at yourself
You'd rather place the blame
Then point it your own way
I still do hide from my feelings myself
But I'm trying hard these days
Not to procrastinate
And face my fate
Stay on my case

[Repeat Chorus]

No one is perfect
No one's the same
We've all got problems
That we haven't faced
The challenges well
They'll make you strong
Don't put them off for too long

You gotta know yourself
To be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
You gotta know yourself
To be yourself
It's a struggle everyday
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
And it's a struggle everyday

[Repeat Chorus x2]

You gotta know yourself to be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
And it's a struggle everyday
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
And it's a struggle everyday
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
And it's a struggle everyday
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
And it's a struggle everyday
