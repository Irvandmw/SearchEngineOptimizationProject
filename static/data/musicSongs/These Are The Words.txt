Lyrics:


Tender was my lover from the suburbs of town
We were sweethearts from college she was always around
We were good for each other but some things they just don't work out

There were tears in my eyes when she walked away
We had plans to get married some day
But the promises were broken before they were even made

Now I'm dancing with a broken heart
Ain't no doctor who can make it start
Singing these are the words that I'm never gonna say again
Because I've given till I've given up
One more casualty of easy love
Singing these are the words that I'm never gonna say again

Tender was my lover, god I miss her embrace
And I wonder who it is that puts a smile on her face
I recall the way she feels and oh I recall the way she tastes
If I could hold her now then all that I'd see
remind me of childhood memories
She was the first day of summer, yeah that girl, that girl's for me

Now I'm dancing with a broken heart
Ain't no doctor who can make it start
Singing these are the words that I'm never gonna say again
Because I've given till I've given up
One more casualty of easy love
Singing these are the words that I'm never gonna say again

And these are the words that I say to your picture
These are the words that I say in a dream
These are the words that I wish I'd said to you
when you were standing here next to me

Because I've given till I've given up
One more casualty of easy love
Singing these are the words that I'm never gonna say again

Oh now I'm dancing with a broken heart
Ain't no doctor who can make it start
Singing these are the words that I'm never gonna say again

Now I'm dancing with a broken heart
Ain't no doctor who can make it start
Singing these are the words that I'm never gonna say again
