Lyrics:


What's yesterday if we can never say
Remember when

Life with no past mm a show with no cast
Can you picture them

Once a day when the chill just won't go away
You have something to warn you in a woman's way

Time will allow one moment of now
Then it's yesterday

Girl you've got to pause to make time stand still
Don't throw this away

Move your eyes in a way that it tickled me
You're no longer afraid you believe in me

Now take a deep breath smile you will regret
Why just can't you wait

Look there's the sun your life has just begun
Only yesterday

The coffee's in the cup the toast is popping up
The smoke's in her hair
La la...
