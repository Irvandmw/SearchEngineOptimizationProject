Lyrics:


I've been waiting for a long time
For the right time to tell you
Now I'm throwing you my lifeline
So be kind, I beg you
Been holding back because I'm so scared
That you won't care and I'll cry
I'm gonna go and lay my soul there
Will you stay there or pass by?

By now, you know
I'm loving you a little more
Every time you call
By now, you're gone
But you leave me just enough to keep me here
And keep me holding on

You're guitar is in the corner
It's a loaner from your brother
I close my eyes and I can hear you
Your sweet song like no other

By now, you know
I'm loving you a little more
Every time you call
By now, you're gone
But you leave me just enough to keep me here
And keep me holding on

Oh, by now, you know
I'm loving you a little more
Every time you call
By now (By now), you're gone (You're gone)
But you leave me just enough to keep me here
Keep me holding
You leave me just enough to keep me here
Keep me holding on
