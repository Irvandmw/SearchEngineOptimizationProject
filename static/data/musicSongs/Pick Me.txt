Lyrics:


You're the finest girl I've ever seen
And I wonder do you notice
That every guy you meet winds up catching feelings for ya
And you can have any of 'em
You can take your pick
But you need to check with me
Girl I promise, I'm legit

Yes, we be going to the movies
In a theatre holdin' hands
I'll walk you home from school
I'll walk you to your classes
Playing my 360 yes you'll be my best friend
But most of all baby doll you'll be my love love love

You should pick me
So tell me can you dig it
I'm everything you need girl
So tell me can you dig it
I'll always be your number one number one fan, dig that
And I should be your one and only man
You should pick me
Tell me can you dig it
Think of how good it could be, girl
So tell me can you dig it
I'll always be your number one number one fan, dig that
And I should be your one and only man
You should pick me

Yeah, you should pick me girl

You're my favorite part of the day
And every morning I look forward to me seeing your face
I just need to see it some more
Baby I'm the kind of guy who can appreciate a girl as amazing as you
So you gotta be my baby

'Cause if you feel me, already we chilling at the beach
I'll take you on a cruise watch the sunset while we eating
You can have anything you want 'cause I'll be your best friend
But most of all baby doll you'll be my love love love love

You should pick me
So tell me can you dig it
I'm everything you need girl
So tell me can you dig it
I'll always be your number one number one fan
Dig that
And I should be your one and only man
You should pick me
Tell me can you dig it
Think of how good it could be girl
So tell me can you dig it
I'll always be your number one number one fan
Dig that
And I should be your one and only man
You should pick me

You should pick the guy that makes you happy
Pick the flyest of 'em
Pick the one that's got swagger
Pick the one that makes you laugh
The one that always got your back
Who would rather die than to make you sad

That's why you should pick me
Tell me can you dig it
I'm everything you need girl
So tell me can you dig it
I'll always be your number one number one fan
Dig that
And I should be your one and only man

You should pick me
Tell me can you dig it
Think of how good it could be girl
I'm everything you need
I'll always be your number one number one fan
Dig that
And I should be your one and only man
You should pick me

You should pick me
