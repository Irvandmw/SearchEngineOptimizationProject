[Kenny Chesney:]
Some people call me the space cowboy
Some call me the gangster (we're gonna turn this into a bar is that alright)
Some people call me Maurice
'Cause I speak of the pompatus of love
People keep talkin' about me, baby
They say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong
Well, don't you worry, baby, don't you worry
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home I feel it

'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
Baby I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one (come on boy)

You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
I really love your peaches, I'm gonna shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
Come on Atlanta Georgia I'm gonna show you a good time

'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
Baby I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one
We get our lovein' on the run

[Dave Matthews:]
Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Rise up this morning
Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you"
Don't worry about a thing (oh babe don't you worry)
Every little thing is gonna be alright
Don't worry about a thing (don't worry about a thing)
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright

[Kenny Chesney:]
'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
Baby I'm a midnight toker
We get our lovin' on the run
