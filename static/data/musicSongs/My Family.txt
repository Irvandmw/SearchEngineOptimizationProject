Lyrics:


Family, family (Family)
I go to war with my family
Ups and downs (Up)
Wrong or right, that's family (Yeah, hey)
They think that we crazy (Crazy)
They say that we crazy, can't handle it (Crazy, yeah)
My back on the wall (Back)
Who I'ma call? My family
We different (Woo), we stick out (Stick out)
Wig out (Wig out), bug out (Hey)
Hop out, hop out (Go)
Ball out (Hey), show out

Aight, this a party
Let's not make a problem (No)
Why you lookin' at me like you're startin' somethin'?
You should know, it's not just me that you be rubbin'
(The wrong way, so you better think twice)

You shouldn't mess with me
You don't wanna mess with me
'Cause if you mess with me, you're messing with my family
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You shouldn't mess with me
You don't wanna mess with me (No)
'Cause if you mess with me, you're messing with my family

Ay-ay-ya-yay
You might think that we are all loco
Ay-ay-yay (Don't mess with my family)
But this family 'bout to go global
(We blowin' up)

En mi familia si hay problema' no jugamos
Y si hay party hasta maÃ±ana celebramos
Si te dicen que estamo' loco', loco' estamos
Y en las buenas y en las malas nos quedamos
No traicionamos (Don't mess with my family)

Aight, this a party
Let's not make a problem (Ay, no)
Why you lookin' at me like there's somethin' up?
You should know, it's not just me that you be rubbin'
(The wrong way, so you better think twice)

You shouldn't mess with me
You don't wanna mess with me
'Cause if you mess with me, you're messing with my family
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You shouldn't mess with me
You don't wanna mess with me
'Cause if you mess with me, you're messing with my family

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You messin' with my family
(La Familia)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't mess with my family (No)

Ay-ay-ya-yay
You might think that we are all loco
Ay-ay-yay
But this family 'bout to go global

They say that we mean
They say that we rude (Rude)
They say we got problems (Problems)
But we say it's cool
Family, family
I go to war with my family
Ups and downs
But wrong or right, that's family

Ay-ay-ya-yay
You might think that we are all loco
(Don't mess with my family)
Ay-ay-yay
But this family 'bout to go global
