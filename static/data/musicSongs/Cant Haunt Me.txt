Lyrics:


[Both]
I'm a zombie, zombie, zombie

[Skylar Grey]
Laying underground
It can't get any worse, get any worse
So violate me as you wish
But I'm too numb to hurt, too numb to hurt

Don't surprised or terrified
There are no more tears left to cry
Do what you like
[Marilyn Manson]
I'll do what I like
[Grey]
So do what you like
[Manson]
I'll do what I like

[Grey]
Nothing can take my breath away
My lungs are empty anyway
Do what you like
[Manson]
I'll do what I like
[Grey]
I'm not alive

[Both]
I'm like a zombie, zombie
So you can't haunt me, you can't haunt me
I'm like a zombie, zombie
So you can't haunt me, you can't haunt me

[Grey]
Washed up with the tide again
I have seen enough, I've seen too much
[Manson]
You haven't seen anything
[Grey]
Come here Necrophilia
I'm cold to the touch, cold to the touch

Don't surprised or terrified
There are no more tears left to cry
Do what you like
[Marilyn Manson]
I'll do what I like
[Grey]
So do what you like
[Manson]
I'll do what I like

[Grey]
Nothing can take my breath away
My lungs are empty anyway
Do what you like
[Manson]
I'll do what I like
[Grey]
I'm not alive

[Both]
I'm like a zombie, zombie
So you can't haunt me, you can't haunt me
I'm like a zombie, zombie
So you can't haunt me, you can't haunt me
