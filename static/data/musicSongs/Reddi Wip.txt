Lyrics:


Baby, you gotta be tripping, put that booty away
You know I be sipping, got a bottle on the way
I stay on my pimping, diamonds jumping out the vase
Tell 'em get up out the way, nigga you can catch a fade
I'm tryna see, mami, remind me yeah
She like a tsunami, can't lie to me yeah
She ride like Ducati, she goddess, yeah
Rev it all, oh my god

And I don't really care if they know, I be sipping on the low
'Cause you got the kinda body, make a papi want some more
Alright, dim the lights, let me hit you with that spice
I ain't playing with you, want you to know

Girl, you got that Reddi Whip
Reddi Whip, Reddi Whip, awh yeah
Uh huh
I just wanna take a dip, in your Reddi Whip
Reddi Whip, awh yeah
Reddi Whip, I'm ready, I'm ready oh
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, Reddi Whip
I'm ready, I'm ready oh
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, Reddi Whip

Yeah, girl, what you doing tonight?
I'm on dirty Sprite, that means that I'm on you
Yeah, yeah, gripping your ass from the side
Look in my eyes, you know what you gon' do
Say what you say, make all them faces, make all them faces
Do it your way, do it your way yeah, ahh
All of these hours keep passing by

No, I don't really care if they know, I be sipping on the low
'Cause you got the kinda body, make a papi want some more
Alright, dim the lights, let me hit you with that spice
I ain't playing with you, want you to know

Girl, you got that Reddi Whip
Reddi Whip, Reddi Whip, awh yeah
Uh huh
I just wanna take a dip, in your Reddi Whip
Reddi Whip, awh yeah
Reddi Whip, I'm ready, I'm ready oh
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, Reddi Whip
I'm ready, I'm ready oh
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, Reddi Whip

Yeah, girl, when we leaving the party
Put whipped cream on your thighs, licking cinnamon off you
Yeah, girl, you too sweet, they ain't lying
And I thought my life was just fine, until I found you
Cake on my face, I wanna taste it, girl, let me taste it
I won't say shit, you know I won't say shit
All of these hours keep passing by
No I don't really care if they know, I ain't playing girl, I wanna lick you up and down
Ah yeah, dim the lights, let me hit you with that spice, I ain't playing, girl, I want you to know

Girl you got that Reddi Whip
Reddi Whip, Reddi Whip, awh yeah
Uh huh
I just wanna take a dip, in your Reddi Whip
Reddi Whip, awh yeah
Reddi Whip, I'm ready, I'm ready oh
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, Reddi Whip
I'm ready, I'm ready oh
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, Reddi Whip
