Lyrics:


I wake up in a sweat can't sleep I'm soaking wet
I toss and turn the whole night through
I keep going in and out of time (ahh ahh)
I just can't seem to bear my world without you there
You've gone back to the life you knew
But somehow I just can't get back to mine (ahh ahh)

When you went away nothing I could say
Could ever bring you back to me
Your lipstick cherry red the hours in my bed
Still haunts my memory

[Chorus:]
A kiss in the rain on a dark afternoon
A heart so in pain cos' love came too soon
A taste of her lips still lingers in vain
A sad souvenir of a kiss in the rain

He could offer more than long walks on the shore
My love for you was not enough
Girl I couldn't keep the flame alive (ahh ahh)
Still when I close my eyes it's you I visualize
Though I try to shout it out
Don't you know these feelings still survive

Was it just a fling at temporary thing
I find the letters that you wrote
And though I set you free you're still a part of me
The spell can not be broke

[Chorus:]
A kiss in the rain on a dark afternoon
A heart so in pain cos' love came too soon
A taste of her lips still lingers in vain
A sad souvenir of a kiss in the rain
