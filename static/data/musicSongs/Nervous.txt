Lyrics:


There are many things, that I would do for you
And I know that you would help me out too
Yet somehow I fear that you are terrified
Well sit down and hear that I'm right by your side

And no matter what you choose
I'll be here for you
Yeah no matter what you do

Baby tell me, tell me why you're nervous
Tell me what's the purpose of us here tonight
Well for me it's simply that I love you
Hopefully you love me too alright
Ooh tell me why you're nervous

It's so hard to tell if you think I'm pretty swell
Could you help me out, cause I'm not doing to well
Yes you brought me here for reasons I don't know
I can only pray that you won't let me go

And no matter what you choose
I'll be here for you
Yeah no matter what you do

Baby tell me, tell me why you're nervous
Tell me whats the purpose of us here tonight
Well for me it's simply that I love you
Hopefully you love me too alright
Ooh tell me why you're nervous

I, I got to know where
You wanna go from here
Cause I won't waste no time, no
Let me make it clear so you can hear my words
I can take it slow but I gotta know so

Tell me, tell me why you're nervous
Tell me whats the purpose of us here tonight
Well for me it's simply that I love you
Hopefully you love me too alright
So tell me, tell me why you're nervous
Tell me whats the purpose of us here tonight
Well for me it's simply that I love you
Hopefully you love me too alright
Ooh tell me why you're nervous
Tell me why you're nervous
