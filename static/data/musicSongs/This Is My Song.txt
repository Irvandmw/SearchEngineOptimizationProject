Lyrics:


Love, this is my song, this is my song, my serenade to you
The world cannot be wrong, if in this world there is you
I care not what the world may say, without your love there is no day
So love, this is my song, this is my song, my serenade to you
I care not what the world may say, without your love there is no day
So love, this is my song, this is my song, my serenade to you
