Lyrics:


Everytime I think about you
Tears fall like rain
Gotta have my arms around you
Though you just bring me pain

That's why in spite of all you've done
Snap your fingers and I'll run
'Cause I get blue
Everytime I think about you, woh yeah

How can I start with somebody new
When I just can't stop loving you
You've got your spell on me
I'll never be free, woh no

Everytime I think about you
Tears fall like rain
I gotta have my arms around you
Though you just bring me pain

That's why in spite of all you've done
Snap your fingers and I'll run
'Cause I get blue, woh, oh oh
Everytime I think about you, woh yeah
Everytime I think about you, woh yeah
Everytime I think about you, woh yeah
