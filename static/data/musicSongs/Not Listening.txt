Lyrics:


I'm not listening, not anymore
The more I learn, the more I ignore
I'm not listening, not anymore
The more I hear, the more I ignore
I'm not listening, not anymore, No

Cause You gotta be bigger, be faster, be stronger
If your gonna survive any longer
In this lifetime, it better be the right time
The first time might be your last time
Am I a failure if I got nothing to lose
No, I'm not a failure, I got something to prove

[Chorus:]
I'm not listening, not anymore
The more I learn, the more I ignore
I'm not listening, not anymore
The more I hear, the more I ignore, the more I ignore

Cause I've lost my innocence
And I'm a stranger, A life changer
I'm a man thats not afraid of danger
I walk my own path, and blaze my own trail
Because I'm not afraid to derail
I won't get in line or be a middle man
So fuck you I'll make my own plan
And I got respect and I don't neglect
The people that I really care to protect
Am I a failure if I got nothing to lose
No, I'm not a failure, I got something to prove

[Chorus]

I told you before, wont listen no more
I told you before, lets settle the score
I told you before, wont listen no more
I told you before, lets settle the score

If not me then who?
If not now then when?
If not me then who?
If not now then when?

[Chorus]

I told you before, wont listen no more
I told you before, lets settle the score
I told you before, wont listen no more
I told you before, lets settle the score

Set it off right now
Blow it up, set it off
Fuck it up, set it off
Blow it up, Blow it up right now
