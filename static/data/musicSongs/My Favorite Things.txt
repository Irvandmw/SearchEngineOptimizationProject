Lyrics:


Raindrops on roses, 
And whiskers on kittens, 
Bright copper kettles, 
And warm woollen mittens, 
Brown paper packages, 
Tied up with strings, 
These are a few of my favorite things... 

Cream colored ponies, 
An' crisp apple strudels, 
Doorbells an' sleigh bells, 
An' schnitzel with noodles, 
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings, 
These are a few of my favorite things... 

Girls in white dresses, 
With blue satin sashes, 
Snow flakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes, 
Silver white winters, 
That melt into springs, 
These are a few of my favorite things... 

When the dog bites, 
When the bee stings, 
When I'm feelin' sad, 
I simply remember my favorite things, 
And then I don't feel so bad... 

Roses....hmmm kittens... 
Kettles.......mittens... 
La dee da, la dee da, 
La dee da, da, 
These are a few of my favorite things... 

When the dog bites, 
When the bee stings, 
When I'm feelin' sad, 
I simply remember my favorite things, 
And little by little my heavy heart sings... 

And then I don't feel so bad...
