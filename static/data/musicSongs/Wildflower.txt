Wildflower
Wildflower

I hear you callin' up my name
I love the sound, I love the taste
And I can see it in your face
You've got a side you can't explain

You're tellin' me, you're tellin' me, you're tellin' me you wanna come over
You wanna be, you wanna be, you wanna be, you wanna be closer
I love it when you wear your hair down over your shoulder
'Cause I wanna hold ya
'Cause I know where tonight is going

You're the only one who makes me
Every time we
I'll tell you what I like
My wildflower
You're the only one who makes me
Every time we
I'll tell you what I like
My wildflower
You know you are my favorite fantasy
A fatal love song, waterfall is overflowin'
You're the only one who makes me
Every time we
I'll tell you what I like
My wildflower

I see the color in your face
It makes me smile, it makes me shake (Ooh)
I see the shadow in my brain
And I like its look, and I like its shape (Ooh)

You're tellin' me, you're tellin' me, you're tellin' me you wanna come over
You wanna be, you wanna be, you wanna be, you wanna be closer
I love it when you wear your hair down over your shoulder
'Cause I wanna hold ya
'Cause I know where tonight is going

You're the only one who makes me
Every time we
I'll tell you what I like
My wildflower
You're the only one who makes me
Every time we
I'll tell you what I like
My wildflower
You know you are my favorite fantasy
A fatal love song, waterfall is overflowin'
You're the only one who makes me
Every time we
I'll tell you what I like
My wildflower

Ooh, ooh, ooh, flower
Wild-wild-wildflower
Wildflower
Wildflower

You're the only one who makes me
Every time we
I'll tell you what I like
My wildflower
You're the only one who makes me
Every time we
I'll tell you what I like
My wildflower
You know you are my favorite fantasy (Wild-wild-wildflower)
A fatal love song, waterfall is overflowin' (Wild-wild-wildflower)
You're the only one who makes me (Wild-wild-wildflower)
Every time we (Wild-wild-wildflower)
I'll tell you what I like
My wildflower
