Lyrics:


Any time
youÂ´re feeling lonely.
Any time
YouÂ´re feeling blue.

Any time
you feel downhearted.
That will proof.
Your love for me is true.

Any time
youÂ´re thinking about me.
ThatÂ´s the time
IÂ´ll think about you.

So, any time, you say,
you want me back again.
That is the time
I come back home to you

[Chorus:]
(Any time
youÂ´re feeling lonely.
Any time
YouÂ´re feeling blue).

Any time
you feel downhearted.
That will proof.
Your love for me is true.

Oh Any time
youÂ´re thinking about me.
ThatÂ´s the time
IÂ´ll think about you.

So, any time, you say,
you want me back again.
That is the time (itÂ´s any time).
That is the time (itÂ´s any time).
Yeah,thatÂ´s the time (itÂ´s any time).
I come back home to you
