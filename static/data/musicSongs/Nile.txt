Lyrics:


[Kendrick Lamar & Beyonce:]
One time I took a swim in the Nile
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear
It made me relax when I came down
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now
Plunging away 'less my body's on top
All of these currents might cost me my life right now
Where danger finds me, it follows the tides
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
She said

[Beyonce:]
Hey little buddy, where you goin'?
I'm not sure of how to know I'm still motion
You seem regular, I seem regular
These streams may take me out to the ocean

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
Then I'll dive in it 'til I'm exhausted and I'm type lacking
Waistline on four deep, senses on forty
Feel like there's four of me

[Kendrick Lamar & Beyonce:]
One time I took a swim in the Nile
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear
It made me relax when I came down
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now
Plunging away 'less my body's on top
All of these currents might cost me my life right now
Where danger finds me, it follows the tides
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
That's some good

[Beyonce:]
Got the Nile runnin' through my body
Look at my natural, I'm so exotic
Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit
Deeper the wounded, deeper the roots
Nubian doused in brown, I'm lounging in it
I don't tend to youth, I said I'm drowning in it

[Kendrick Lamar & Beyonce:]
I'm in denial, deep in denial
I'm in the Nile, deep in denial

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's some good
