Lyrics:


I'm just as nervous as you
Last night I took one look at you
And I got this feeling you're the right one

Now you don't know what to do
Time ticks away and you got to choose
You know which feeling is the right one,
The right one

This is what it looks like
This is what it feels like
And this is your heart beating faster,
Faster

I'll lose my voice
If you won't make a choice
I'll lose my head
If you go to him again
I'll lose my mind
If you won't take me back tonight
Take me back tonight

I hope I'm not pressuring you
That's the last thing I'd ever want to do
Cause you know which feeling's the right one
The right one

This is what it looks like
This is what it feels like
And this is your heart beating faster,
Faster

I'll lose my voice
If you wont make a choice
I'll lose my head
If you go to him again
I'll lose my mind
If you won't take me back tonight
Take me back tonight [x2]

I can't stand this
I can't just watch you get hurt
You know which feeling's the right one
The right one

This is what it looks like
This is what it feels like
And this is your heart beating faster,
Faster

I'll lose my voice
If you wont make a choice
I'll lose my head
If you go to him again
I'll lose my mind
If you won't take me back tonight
Take me back

I'll lose my voice
If you wont make a choice
I'll lose my head
If you go to him again
I'll lose my mind
If you won't take me back tonight
Take me back tonight [x3]
