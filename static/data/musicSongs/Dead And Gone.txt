Lyrics:


Well this summer light
Will it wait for me?
I can't please you all at one time
Hell, can anybody?
Something always suffers no matter the cost
A husband, a wife, or your life, or your job

Oh the balance I seek will be too hard to keep
If nobody cares if you're dead and gone
If nobody cares if I'm happy at all

The guy from the bar
Wants you to bend for him
When he has you on your floor
It won't matter cause he's earning
Something always suffers no matter the cost
Your ability to survive behind the lies that are told

Oh the balance I seek will be too hard to keep
If nobody cares if you're dead and gone
If nobody cares if you're happy at all

There was a time
My people were product to you
If we can't supersede them now
Where will I be heading to?
Something always suffers at my humanity's cost
You doubt me as a woman but claim to respect my job

Oh the balance I seek will be too hard to keep
If nobody cares if you're dead and gone
If nobody cares if I'm happy at all

For nobody cares if I'm stuck on the door
Keep the pretense up, don't you moan

Oh the balance I seek will be too hard to keep
If nobody cares if I'm dead and gone
