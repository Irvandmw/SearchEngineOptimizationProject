Lyrics:


My condolences
I'll shed a tear with your family
I'll open a bottle up
Pour a little bit out in your memory
I'll be at the wake dressed in all black
I'll call out your name, but you won't call back
I'll hand a flower to your mother when I say goodbye
Cause, baby, you're dead to me

I need to kill you
That's the only way to get you out of my head
Oh I need to kill you
To silence all the sweet little things you've said
I really wanna kill you
Wipe you off the face of my earth
And bury your bracelet
Bury your bracelet
Six feet under the dirt

Rainy days and black umbrellas
Who's gonna save you now?
Can you cheat from underground?

My condolences
I'll shed a tear with your family
I'll open a bottle up
Pour a little bit out in your memory
I'll be at the wake dressed in all black
I'll call out your name but you won't call back
I'll hand a flower to your mother when I say goodbye
Cause, baby, you're dead to me

I'll mourn you when you go
Baby, you're dead to me
I'll mourn you when you go

I need to say sorry
That's the only thing you say when you lose someone
I used to say I'm sorry
For all of the stupid shit you've done
So now I'm really sorry, sorry for being the apologetic one
But if I told you I cared, if I told you I care
You would think I was crazy

My condolences
I'll shed a tear with your family
I'll open a bottle up
Pour a little bit out in your memory
I'll be at the wake dressed in all black
I'll call out your name but you won't call back
I'll hand a flower to your mother when I say goodbye
Cause, baby, you're dead to me

I'll mourn you when you go
Baby, you're dead to me
I'll mourn you when you go
Cause, baby, you're dead to me
