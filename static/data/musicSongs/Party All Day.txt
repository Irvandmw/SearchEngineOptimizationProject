Lyrics:


Summertime's here the days are getting longer
That get outside feelings getting stronger
Load up the boats and get 'em on the water and throw out a line

Pull off your shirts and rub a little screen on
Put on your shades it's time to get your tan on
Pull out and pop the top on a cold one and have a good time

I can taste those ribs and barbecue sauce
No time like now for a little time off

[Chorus:]
That's how we roll that's how we rock
We roll and rock and rock and roll the fun never stops
I wanna party all day
I don't wanna work, I just wanna play
I wanna party all day

Lay in the sun watch the blues blow away

Head out to rock cove and hang at the sand bar
pontoons and houseboats rockin' it real hard

Jack on ice and shine in a glass jar
Who needs a shot
When the sun goes down will build us a bonfire
Wont take long to find us a live wires
Pull out guitars and start us beach chior yall sing a long
Weâll crash where we land and Weâll all sleep in
When noon comes up will do it again

[Chorus:]
That's how we roll that's how we rock
We roll and rock and rock and roll the fun never stops
I wanna party all day
I don't wanna work I just wanna play
I Wanna Party All Day

Lay In The Sun Watch The Blues Blow Away

All The Girls Got There Hands Up
Dancing Round With Their Red Cups
Shaking Those Tan Lines
Just Might Make A Man Go Blind
