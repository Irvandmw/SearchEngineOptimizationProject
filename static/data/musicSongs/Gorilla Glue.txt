Lyrics:


Yeah yeah yeah ugh, aye
Aye man I'm back on my baby Jesus

Just got some gorilla glue it came with seeds, I'ma pop em out and act like its OG
I'ma go send them bitches back to Charlotte, got em for 1000 sell em for the three
Nigga keep blowing up my phone crying to me, tryna get me sellin for the cheap
No bitch you ain't go to receipt (ugh)
Ain't no refunds on a beat (ugh)

I got a bitch that a freak she's on my side of town so she stay up the street (ugh)
I don't like talking to broke bitches I remain silent like they the police (ugh)
My bitches know I'ma dog I'ma go fuck another bitch
I need a leash (ugh) my baby Jesus he ain't from Miami
But that nigga ballin and he got the heat (ugh)
Please don't compare me to rap niggas ain't no comparison not to unique (ugh)
Dunkin on niggas I'm buttering' shout-out to money man he did the feet (ugh)
I hit to yo dude and remixed embarrassed a rapper and shit on this beat (ugh)
Somebody I'm moving Savage and put me in beast mode now it's time to eat

Just got some gorilla glue it came with seeds, I'ma pop em out and act like its OG
I'ma go send them bitches back to Charlotte, got em for 1000 sell em for the three
Nigga keep blowing up my phone crying to me, tryna get me sellin for the cheap
No bitch you ain't go to receipt (ugh)
Ain't no refunds on a beat (ugh)
The baby
The baby
The baby
Ugh ey
And I'm back on my baby Jesus
