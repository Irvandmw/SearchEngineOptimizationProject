Lyrics:


Do your thang honey!

I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something about you caught my eye
Something moved me deep inside!

I don't know what you did, boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since

Told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friends
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
Alright
Every time I see you everything starts making sense

Do your thang honey!

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
(what you do)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon

You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true
Alright
Ain't no other man but you

Never thought I'd be all right
No, no, no!
'Til you came and changed my life
What was cloudy now is clear!
You're the light that I needed

You got what I want, boy, and I want it!
So keep on givin' it up!

So, tell your mother, your brother, your sister, and your friends
And the others, your lovers, better not be present tense
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no one else's!

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon

You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you

Break it down now!

Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other-other
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover!
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other!
Ain't no other man but you, boy!

You are there when I'm a mess
Talk me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
(You're the kinda guy a girl finds)

You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you

And now I'm tellin' you, so, ain't no other man but you

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon

You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Don't you know ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
