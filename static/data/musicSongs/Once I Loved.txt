Lyrics:


Once I loved...
And I gave so much love to this love
It was the world to me!

Once I cried...
At the thought I was foolish an' proud
And let you say goodbye!

Then, one day...
From my infinite sadness you came
And brought me love again!

Now I know...
That no matter whatever befalls
I'll never let you go!

I will hold you close... make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing
When it goes away...

...love is the saddest thing
When it goes away...

[instrumental break]

I will hold you close... make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing
When it goes away...

...love is the saddest thing
When it goes away...

...when it goes away...
