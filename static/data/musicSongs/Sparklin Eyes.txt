Lyrics:


(Sparklin' eyes that glow and glow and glow)
(Sparklin' eyes that glow and glow and glow)
Don't need the stars that shine above
Your eyes reveal the light of love
Sparklin' eyes big and bright glow with love for me tonight
Sparklin' sparklin' eyes just shine for me

When you keep clinging like a vine
I know that you are mine all mine
Sparklin' eyes keep that gleam
If I'm dreaming let me dream
Sparklin' sparklin' eyes just shine for me

I can't believe it's really true
That any one would look at me the way you do
If you would ever leave my heart
My world would simply fall apart

Sparklin' eyes burning bright light the way for love tonight
Sparklin' sparklin' eyes that shine
Sparklin' sparklin' eyes just shine
Sparklin' sparklin' eyes just shine for me
Shine for me
Shine for me
