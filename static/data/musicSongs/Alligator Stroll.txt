Lyrics:


Well I was born on a Friday in the Florida sun
By the Kissimmee River and before I was one
My mama alligator said to me with a smile
Let me show you how to walk in a particular style

You take a little bit a country and some slow rock-and-roll
And what you got goin' is the alligator stroll

(Okay)
I hold my head up high I keep my feet on the ground
I never hurry never worry as I'm strollin' around
I can keep a certain tempo that is lazy and sweet
And I don't need shoes 'cuz I've got alligator feet

You take a little bit a country and some slow rock-and-roll
And what you got goin' is the alligator stroll

I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna bite
I use my 75 teeth for a smile so bright
You can recognize me by my rose-colored shades
As I make my strollin' way through the Everglades
I'm strollin'
Still strollin' (Yeah)

Oh oh, bless my soul
What we got goin' is the alligator stroll

Left, right, left, right

I got a letter from my cousins in the Great Dismal Swamp
They said they wanna teach me their alligator stomp
So I'm strollin' that direction in the way that I do
I hope to reach the Carolinas by the time I'm 82

If you like a little country and some slow rock-and-roll
You can follow right behind me with the alligator stroll

(Put on your shades)
(Looks good, follow me)

We're goin' left, right, left, right
Give a Hollywood smile with those teeth so white
Now stroll to the left, back, forth
Now we're strollin' to the right (step South, step North)
Now we're strollin' straight ahead in an alligator row
And every now and then we do a little do-si-do
Rock, roll, rock, roll
All the way to Carolina with the alligator
(I'm in no hurry)
Stroll

See ya later
Alligator
