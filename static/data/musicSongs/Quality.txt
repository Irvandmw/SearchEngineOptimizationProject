Lyrics:


Woo...
Give this man the fucking beat...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm a go get it, break it down in equipment yeah
I'm in the kitchen, whip it how a nigga whip it yeah
Acking the shipment, you know I pack it then I ship it yeah
Time to do digits, the fed came in and we hit it yeah
I'm out the cut on these niggas I do the work in the back o the Honda
I got the quality work on the streets like I'm DJ Drama
Call me Meek Mill cause this money time a lot put in and lost her
Feel like Kanye cause this music shit really turn into a monster

Had a bitch named Rhonda she was serving for a nigga
Had them burns for a nigga, got the dirt for a nigga
Send this bitch cross country
Young nigga flip the twenty piece
Gotta fight nigga, you and me
Got the twenty twenty you can see
Drug you with the bullets boy don't let me OD
Suggest you pay my fees if you niggas owe me
Cause I just won't be [?] if they make a cold piece
And nigga I ain't stopping till I bust that Roley
These niggas always on that fake shit
I was trappin out the vacant bitch
To the house and then I changed my clothes
To page a girl watch her shake some shit
Got one started it never worked
Send this stripper to a naked bitch
Aye Rhondy I ain't tryna pay your rent
I just like doing faces bitch

I'm a go get it, break it down in equipment yeah
I'm in the kitchen, whip it how a nigga whip it yeah
Acking the shipment, you know I pack it then I ship it yeah
Time to do digits, the fed came in and we hit it yeah
I'm out the cut on these niggas I do the work in the back o the Honda
I got the quality work on the streets like I'm DJ Drama
Call me Meek Mill cause this money time a lot put in and lost her
Feel like Kanye cause this music shit really turn into a monster

Boy you can see right through a nigga
Boy I see how you were doing nigga
Yo bitch be over she can do a nigga
But I be thinking what you doing with her
You think you rich well I sue a nigga
But I ain't fucking with the courtroom
I get nervous in that motherfucker
Cause the gallows tend to haunt you
I gotta whip with the shit, aye
It ain't the [?] I can do again
I take a stack to state to state
Treat that bitch like a souvenir
Bitch I gotta get a mansion
Young nigga gotta move it in
Then a nigga gotta take it out
Pack the shipment then I gotta move again
Put the gun shit down
Had to go and make music
I been in and out them restaurants
But I ain't never got to move shit
Real message to you young niggas
But be careful who you do it with
These niggas ain't solid
They go back home and say you a snitch

I'm a go get it, break it down in equipment yeah
I'm in the kitchen, whip it how a nigga whip it yeah
Acking the shipment, you know I pack it then I ship it yeah
Time to do digits, the fed came in and we hit it yeah
I'm out the cut on these niggas I do the work in the back o the Honda
I got the quality work on the streets like I'm DJ Drama
Call me Meek Mill cause this money time a lot put in and lost her
Feel like Kanye cause this music shit really turn into a monster
