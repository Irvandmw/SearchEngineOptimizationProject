Lyrics:


Broken homes, fighting brothers
Drugs are sold upon a streets
Terrorism, and alcoholism
The selfish motives guide the world
Weeping mothers, oh, crying fathers
What has this world come too

They are so broken, but oh, we hear them singing oh, oh, oh...
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it
They are so broken, but oh, we hear them singing oh, oh, oh...
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it

Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Sing it to the people, let's live until we die

Corrupt the business I'll do whatever it takes
Don't work a day unless your paid
One man stance and broken hearts
We forgot how to love
I'll shoot them up and take them down
I don't bleed on my grown?

They are so broken, but oh, we hear them singing oh, oh, oh...
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it
They are so broken, but oh, we hear them singing oh, oh, oh...
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it

Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Sing it to the people, let's live until we die
Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Sing it to the people, let's live until we die
