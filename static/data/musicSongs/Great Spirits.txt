Lyrics:


When the earth was young
And the air was sweet
And the mountains kissed the sky
In the far beyond, with its many paths
Man and nature lived side by side

The pretty wisdom does not come without learning
And the vision not wholly without our eyes
We can think that we see
Truly see you're around us
But when we look
Do we see with open minds?

Great Spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
The key to understanding
Is to see the other sides
Find a way to help us
See from outside
Truly see from outside

Teach our children to look deeper than the surface
See the world through another's eyes
For to be blind me on yourself
Is to look but not see it
Knowing much is enough to be wise

To see the wonder
In all we've been given
In a world that's not always as it seems
On the part that we choose
Turn every corner
Follow on for another begins

Great Spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls
With all you know
Key to understanding
Is to see the other sides
Find a way to help us
See from outside
Truly see from outside

Great Spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls
With all you know
Key to understanding
Is to see the other sides
Find a way to help us
See from outside
Truly see from outside
See from outside
