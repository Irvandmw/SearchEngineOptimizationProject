Lyrics:


There's a time when the heart can no longer give in
You'll try to stand up and fight
You've known pain for so long and you know what's gone wrong
But you can't make it right
Another broken heart is all your feeling
How can you go on
But the memories of times there was love in your eyes
Keep leading me on

[CHORUS]
If it were you
Would you hold on and hope that it might
Bring back the dreams we once knew
Or give up forever that part of your life
Tell me what you would do
If it were you
You can never take back all you've given in love
No matter how hard you try
It's over and done you just have to let go
Though a part of you died
Another waste of time is all that's left now
But life must go on
All the nights that we spent, never thought
They would end
Why can't they go on
If it were you
Would you hold on and hope
that it might bring back the love we once knew
or just give up forever that part of your life
Tell me what would you do
If it were you
If it were you
Tell me what would you do
If it were you
Over and over I go back through time
Didn't we promise our love till we die
Asking you deep down inside
Did we really try
Another broken heart is all that is left
But life must go on
All the nights that we spent, never thought
They would end
Why can't they go on

[CHORUS]
