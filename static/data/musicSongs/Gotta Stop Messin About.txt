Lyrics:


Sittin' outside your door
About to break down
Fourth time this week
Somebody's come around
Who's it gonna be tonight?
Who's the lucky man?
Where you get the attitude
I'll never understand
Uh oh, here he comes now
So happy that he came
Hey! Was it good boy?
Thoughts so over lame

What goes on inside your head
That makes you want to take them all to bed?

Gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You know you gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
Oh yeah

When I call you on the phone
You act so unconcerned
I wanna get you all alone
Ooh baby, to show you what I've learned
Why you won't give me the time of day
You won't give me some time
You won't give me anything
God, you think you're too fine
Can't you see?

All I want is a little time
I've been playing with my toy so much I'm gonna go blind

Gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about

Oh yeah

Gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You do it too much
You gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
Oo, stop
