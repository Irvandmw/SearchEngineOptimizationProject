Lyrics:


Well, they say the sea is rising,
Well, that's alright with me
'Cause there ain't no other place than on the sea I'd rather be.
And that second coming's comin',
It's right around the bend.
And some day could be any day this world is gonna end

But that's alright, that's okay.
There ain't nothing we can do about the whole thing anyway.

It's a hang on kinda ride,
We're spinning through space and time,
Rockin' this big old rock just tryna have some fun.
So let's drink another beer,
Here's to another year,
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun.

We're all swimmin' in a fish bowl,
Just floatin' through the sky,
Pulled along by gravity and nobody knows why.
So it's a Cosmic Hallelujah
That we're sittin' here right now,
And Becky's at the bar buyin' us all another round.

And that's okay, yeah, that's alright.
I ain't gonna over-think or over-analyze tonight.

It's a hang on kinda ride,
We're spinning through space and time,
Rockin' this big old rock just tryna have some fun.
So let's drink another beer,
Here's to another year,
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun.

We're just a hands-up roller coaster flyin' with no brakes.
We're just a speck of salt rollin' down a tidal wave.
We're just a Babe Ruth baseball hit over the wall.
We're just a drop of rain over a waterfall.

It's a hang on kinda ride,
We're spinning through space and time,
Rockin' this big old rock just tryna have some fun.
So let's drink another beer,
Here's to another year,
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun.
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun.
