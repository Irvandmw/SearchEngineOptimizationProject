Lyrics:


Here goes another day
I'm rollin' more miles away
And I would give anything
To see you tonight

Two more weeks of this endless road
Another loneliness overload
But I'd wait a hundred years
For a glimpse of your smile
And the touch of your hand

The touch of your hand lyin' soft in mine
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm
Anything I could hope to be
With the touch of your hand

Half-kept promises and dreamer's hopes
Love by phone and "miss you" notes
And I meant to give so much more
Well, so much for plans

But if you think that I've let you down
Chasin' fool's gold from town to town
I'd never know by the love in your eyes
Or the laugh in your voice
Or the touch of your hand

The touch of your hand lyin' soft in mine
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm
Anything I could hope to be
With the touch of your hand

The touch of your hand lyin' soft in mine
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm
Anything I could hope to be
With the touch of your hand
The touch of your hand
