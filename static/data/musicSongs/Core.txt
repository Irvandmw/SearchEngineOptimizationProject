Lyrics:


And I know we said
One more fight and we separate
And I know we said
Can't keep living our lives this way
And I know we made
10 thousand other real promises
What we said
It's easier said than done

'Cause I don't wanna give up anymore
Said even though we're standing at the door
I said even thought we'll never know for sure
Darling I just feel it, feel it

I feel it in my core, my core, my core
Just like I did before, before, in my core
Don't give up now

I feel it my core, my core
My core, my core

And I know they say
Never let go of the [?]
And I know they say
Life is a little too short to wait
And you know I say
I don't even know about what they say
'Cause love can change
Even the brightest minds

And I don't wanna give up anymore
Said even though we're standing at the door
I said even thought we'll never know for sure
Darling I just feel it, feel it

I feel it in my core, my core, my core
Just like I did before, before, in my core
Don't give up now

Said I feel it my core, my core
My core, my core
My core, my core
My core, my core

And I know we said
One more fight and we separate
And I know we said
Can't keep living our lives in pain
But if you want
To take that first step out the door
I hope you feel the same as me

In your core, your core
