Lyrics:
Lyrics:


There is a fountain that I see
Filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath that blood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath, beneath that blood
They're gonna lose all their guilt-guilty stains!

Mmmm oh Lord
Mmmm
Mmmm

The sinners, sinners plunged beneath, beneath that blood
They're gonna lose all their guilt-guilty stains!
