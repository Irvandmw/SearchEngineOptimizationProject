Lyrics:


Cant believe that I'm home all alone
Doesn't stop me from wanting to see you
Why the hell won't you pick up the phone?
Hello?
Don't know which way is up anymore
No excuses and nothing to cling to
Oh you're shaking me right to the core

Just wanna let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn it round

All my friends say that "I told you so"
They ain't making me feel any better
Buttons up and it's on with the show
Got me aching inside of my skin
No excuses and nothing to cling to
You will pay for the state that I'm in

Just wanna let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn it round

But you gon' see wiser me
And I won't break down easily

Just wanna let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn it round

Just wanna let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn it round

Don't you go
Don't you go
