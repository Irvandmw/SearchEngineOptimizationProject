Lyrics:


I wonder, do you think about me
Flyin' down the highway
Just you and the radio
I wonder if we were still together
If we would be happy
Like we were not that long ago

Would we be holdin' each other
So close under the covers
If I hadn't screwed it all up
Would it matter if I ever called you
Would sparks fly if I ever saw you
The truth is, I may never know
But I wonder

I wonder if you have a husband
Did you give him some children
Are you livin' the American dream
I wonder if there is a shoebox
Of pictures you've been hidin'
No one will ever see

Would we be holdin' each other
So close under the covers
If I hadn't screwed it all up
Would it matter if I ever called you
Would sparks fly if I ever saw you
The truth is, I may never know

I'm probably crazy for thinkin' these thoughts
About how it all could have been
It ain't every day that I dig up the past
But every now and then

I wonder would we be holdin' each other
So close under the covers
The truth is, I may never know
But I wonder
I wonder
I wonder
Oh, I wonder
Oh, oh
I wonder
I wonder
