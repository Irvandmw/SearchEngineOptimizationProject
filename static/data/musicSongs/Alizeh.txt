Lyrics:


Pyaar maine jo nibhaya
Tere rehte, tere saath bhi
Sach kahun toh, uss se zyada
Chaha tujhko, tere baad bhi

Mmmâ¦ main dard hoon
Tu dava hai na
Main aag hoon
Tu hawa hai na

Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Kahaan hai tu
Mere dil mein hai na
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Tera hoon main
Tujhe yaad hai na [x2]

Sooraj dhale toh lagta hai jaise
Kaandhe pe mere sar hai tera
Mera thikana chahe jahaan ho
Yaadon mein meri ghar hai tera

Sooraj dhale toh lagta hai jaise
Kaandhe pe mere sar hai tera
Mera thikana chahe jahaan ho
Yaadon mein meri ghar hai tera

Main hoon jahaan
Tu wahaan hai na
Main aag hoon
Tu hawa hai na

Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Kahan hai tu
Mere dil mein hai na
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh
Tera hoon main
Tujhe yaad hai na [x2]

In the darkness
You help me find a spark
The sweetest soul with the kindest heart
If only you could see you the way I do
You'd see the sunshine and it's beautiful

Yeah! and all you have to do is smile
I give anything to be there just to see it now
To lay with you in the warmth of the summers night
And watch the moon and stars come to life
Can't begin to explain just what you did for me
Yeah there was something in your energy
Close my eyes and I still feel you in every breeze
That's how I know you're still with me

I've died a thousand times for you
Walked a million miles for you
I'd live and still be dead, you see
If you'd be living without me
