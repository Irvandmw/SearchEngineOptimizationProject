Lyrics:


Get a little nervous, then I stumble and I hesitate
Never take a chance because I'm too afraid my heart will break
Everything I ever want is standing right in front of me
But I think that I'm runnin' from the only one I really need

But time stands still and I'm feeling so much
And it's all right here and I just gotta trust that
You're the one, and the time has come
So tell me, baby, what's it gonna take?

We can be the champions, we can own the night
Yeah, it might destroy us, but we gotta try
Can't keep looking backwards, running from the light
'Cause this could be the greatest moment of our lives

Get a little closer now and I can feel it in my blood
Something 'bout your energy that moves me every time we touch
Worshippin' the only thing that's always playin' on my mind
So tell me what we waiting for 'cause we should lay it on the line

But time stands still and I'm feeling so much
And it's all right here and I just gotta trust that
You're the one, and the time has come
So tell me, baby, what's it gonna take?

We can be the champions, we can own the night
Yeah, it might destroy us, but we gotta try
Can't keep looking backwards, running from the light
'Cause this could be the greatest moment of our lives

We could be the champions, we can own the night
This could be the greatest moment of our lives

(Champions, champions)
Fighting till the last in the dust, no, we won't back down
(Champions, champions)
It's time to let the whole world know

We can be the champions, we can own the night
Yeah, it might destroy us, but we gotta try
Can't keep looking backwards, running from the light
'Cause this could be the greatest moment of our lives

We could be the champions, we can own the night
This could be the greatest moment of our lives
