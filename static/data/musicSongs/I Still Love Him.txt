Lyrics:


And I remember when I met him, it was so clear that
He was the only one for me

We both knew it, right away

And as the years went on, things got more difficult
We were faced with more challenges

I begged him to stay
Try to remember what we had at the beginning
He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it
When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up
To talk to him
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself

I always got the sense that he became torn
Between being a good person and
Missing out on all of the opportunities
That life could offer a man as magnificent as him

And in that way I understood him
And I loved him
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him
And I still love him
I love him
