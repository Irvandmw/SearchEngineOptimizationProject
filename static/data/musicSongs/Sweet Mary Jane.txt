Lyrics:


I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
CafÃ© clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight

I drill you deep into my chest
Thatâs where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
âCause I donât want to be alone

âCause everyday that Iâm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane wonât you sing another song

CafÃ© clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But weâre only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes

With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue,
âCause I donât want to be alone

âCause everyday that Iâm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane wonât you me sing another song

Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sing another song

Mary Jane,
Iâve been hoping alone
Mary Jane,
Since you came along
Mary Jane,
Iâm almost home
Mary Jane,
Sing another song

âCause everyday that Iâm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane wonât you me sing another song

âCause everyday that Iâm breathing, sweet Mary Jane
I love the sound of your sweet words, sweet Mary Jane
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane wonât you sing me another song
