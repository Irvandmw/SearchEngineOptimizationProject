Lyrics:


You don't give a damn 'bout the blood and sweat that I spill
To make it so I'm standing right here
But you could bet your soul and your faith in God that I will
Not fold in the face of this fear
'Cause I won't be intimidated by you... pushed down and lied to
I'm not a fool or a punk
And you could try to bruise me and break me
Please don't mistake me
See if I don't get right back up

Now, now see if I don't get right back up
Now, now see if I don't get right back up
Now, now see if I don't get right back up
Now, now see if I don't get right back up

It's something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give you what you need like papa, who shot you
"Separate the weak from the obsolete."
You're the meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on a dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?

Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break-down
You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank take-down
And no mistakes now, coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that
