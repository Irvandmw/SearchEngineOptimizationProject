Lyrics:


I told you once, i told you twice 
that boy you been with is not being right 
i see the tears you try to hide 
that boy you've been with is way out of line

[Bridge 1]
i've been there through sun and rain 
i've been there to ease the pain 
gotta learn how to break the chain

[Chorus]
Girl if i give you my world would you be my girl 
what would it take i'll wait forever somethings are meant to be 
you and me
and if you take a piece of my heart, a touch of your soul 
look what we've got, we fit together 
i know this much is true i was made for loving you

just ask your friends i've seen him out 
that boy you've been with is playing around
i'm here because confirm your doubts 
that boy you've been with to me in doubt

[Bridge 2]
i'll be there though times have changed 
i'll be there i'll be the same
till you learn how to break the chains

[Chorus]

you make it you take it 
it's clear to me there is something between us
mistake it my hearts breaking 
i'm begging you please

[Bridge 1]

[Chorus repeat till fade]
