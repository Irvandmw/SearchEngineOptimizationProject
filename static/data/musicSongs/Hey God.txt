Lyrics:


Hey, God, I don't believe I ever thanked you
For the time my brother got sick
Wasn't sure he'd make it
Then he finally pulled through

And, hey, God, I wanna thank you for my family
They're healthy and they're beautiful
We were gonna stop at two
Now there's number three

You have your ways, you have your plan
Sometimes mysterious and hard to understand
I am humbled by your grace and everything you do
Hey, God, hey, God, I just wanna thank you

Hey God, take good care of my nephew
He was only nineteen
They say he didn't feel a thing
Now he's there with you

And, hey, God, you know what it's like to lose
Someone who you truly love when you gave your son to us
You must have cried then too

You have your ways, you have your plan
Sometimes mysterious and hard to understand
I am humbled by your grace and everything you do
Hey, God, hey, God, I just wanna thank you

Sometimes I forget to stop and bow my head
And remember that I have been blessed

Oh, you have your ways, you have your plan
Sometimes mysterious and hard to understand
I am humbled by your grace and everything you do
Hey, God, hey, God, I just wanna thank you

Thank you
