Lyrics:


I ain't ever going back again
I'm happy in the place I'm in
Surrounded by my best friends
That I just met today

A toast to Sara and a toast to Sam
Here's to jamming to this three quarter jam
Let the world go on, I don't give a damn
I ain't ever going back again

I'm gonna stay down here for the whole season
And when the season's done, I still ain't leaving
'Cause lately I've given up on making sense
Out of life and love so I'm gonna stay
And like the band I'm gonna drift away

I ain't ever going back again
I'm feeling comfortable in my skin
A little numb but I'm on the mend
Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay

A toast to Sheila and a toast to Jane
I may never know their last names
But it don't matter in the shape we're in
I ain't ever going back again

I'm gonna stay down here for the whole season
And when the season's done, I still ain't leaving
Lately I've given up on making sense
Out of life and love so I'm gonna stay
And like the band I'm gonna drift away
