Lyrics:


(You know how we do)

I want a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter
I want it heavy, I want the fury
I wanna beat it out the judge and the jury

From the outside everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside
From the outside everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside

We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital heartbeat
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything

I want a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter
I want it heavy, I want the fury
I wanna beat it out the judge and the jury

From the outside everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside
From the outside everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside

We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital heartbeat
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything

They been saying, they been saying the same thing
And they, they been saying, they been saying the same thing
And they, they been saying, they been saying the same thing
And they, they been saying, they been saying the same thing

And they, they been saying, they been saying the same thing
And they, they been saying, they been saying the same thing
They, they been saying, they been saying the same thing
And they, they been saying, they been saying the same thing

We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital heartbeat
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital heartbeat
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything
