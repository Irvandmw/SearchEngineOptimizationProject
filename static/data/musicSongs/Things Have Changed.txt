Lyrics:


A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
Thereâs a woman on my lap and sheâs drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassinâs eyes
Iâm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
Iâm well dressed, waiting on the last train

Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now Iâm expecting all hell to break loose

[Chorus:]
People are crazy and times are strange
Iâm locked in tight, Iâm out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

This place ainât doing me any good
Iâm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Ainât no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think heâs got anything to prove

Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
Donât get up gentlemen, Iâm only passing through

[Chorus]

Iâve been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
Iâve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You canât win with a losing hand

Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street

[Chorus]

I hurt easy, I just donât show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
Iâm in love with a woman who donât even appeal to me

Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
Iâm not that eager to make a mistake

[Chorus]
