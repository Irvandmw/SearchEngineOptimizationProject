Lyrics:


[CHORUS]
Boom Boom Boom
Bang Bang Bang
Theirs a war going on in this heart of mine
Boom Boom Boom
Bang Bang Bang
Theirs a war going on in this heart of mine
Their sneaking up
From Behing
Trying to get in
In my heart in my
Hear me thought
You will find
Boom Boom Boom
Theirs a war in this heart of mine

[Verse 1]
Though theirs no need for you to act so cold
Ill just stay good, your just a pretty boy
I don't want to buy you
I don't want to frighten you
Theres just want thing I want to do
Not put my finger on my pretty little trigger it goes

[CHORUS]

[Verse 2]
Tell me if I am moving away to fast
Your tough nightmares on streetlight sudden gas
This world can be so dark, much when you point that sparks
If your not there for me then

[CHORUS]

Ooops!

[CHORUS x2]
