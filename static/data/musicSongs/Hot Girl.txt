Lyrics:


Yeah, yeah
I put that 15-0-1 chain around my neck and now it's lit, ay!

All the hot girls make it pop, pop, pop (Pop, pop)
Bad bitches with the bag say "ah-ya-ya"
If he ain't talking 'bout no money tell him "bye, bye, bye" (Boy bye!)
And if you see a mad hoe tell her "hah hah hah"

Hey!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe
Don't get mad hoe, fuck a broke hoe
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe

Spicy, pricey
Neck and wrist icy
Bitch it's money-making Megan, hoe - she like me
I rode it, a soldier
A hot girl, he want it
Pull up in that 'Masera', getting top on lock (Skrr)
They still tryna find a thang that I can't do
I told her "If you go against me, you a damn fool!" (Bitch you dumb)
But keep talking 'bout me, bitch, that's all you can do (Oh, okay!)
But keep my cat up out ya mouth, cause that's ya man's food
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (She like 'what?')
I know you crunk, but lil' bih, please watch my shoes (Goddamn!)
I'm not the DJ but I will make ya body move (Goddamn!)
Watch ya' mouth before I leave here with your boo

All the hot girls make it pop, pop, pop
Bad bitches with the bag say "ah-ya-ya"
If he ain't talking 'bout no money tell him "bye, bye, bye" (Boy bye!)
And if you see a mad hoe tell her "hah-hah-hah"

Hey!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe!
Don't get mad hoe, fuck a broke hoe!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe!

Lil' thundercat, throw it back - he can't handle that
I'on want to talk unless a nigga finna throw a stack
Bad attitude, but I'm cute so he call me back
I'mma need that head, give me neck like a vertebra
Check my body
Oochie wally, where ya' wallet?
If I take yo' nigga it's nothing you can do about it (Not at all)
I'm the fucking hottie
I'm not yo' momma or your partner, so don't play with me
Bitch, I'm from Texas, we get rowdy
I got my hands up on my knees
I'm 'bout to work him out his jeans
He get behind me, I'mma QB throw it back and wide receive
Yo' nigga wish he had me
Boy yo' BM ashy
And I'm cocoa-buttered down
Pretty brown, Bad B
Ay!

All the hot girls make it pop, pop, pop
Bad bitches with the bag say "ah-ya-ya"
If he ain't talking 'bout no money tell him "bye, bye, bye" (Boy bye!)
And if you see a mad hoe tell her "hah-hah-hah"

Hey!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe!
Don't get mad hoe, fuck a broke hoe!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe!

I can make ya' man do what I want him to do
Cause when he seen me, he ain't want to fuck with you
I point down at this candy, told him what he finna chew
And tease you with the nigga
Nah nee, nah nee, boo-boo
I want some money, yeah, I want some money
And he gone bring it to Megan, do what I say like it's Mommy
I wrap that dick like a mummy, he do not run when I'm cumming
He open up and he catch it
He suck these titties, these legends
I throw that booty, he fetch it
This pussy really a present
I got the Michael, that Thriller
These bitches hiding they niggas
I got that 'Now' and that 'Later'
He gone eat through the paper
He tryna eat through these panties
He bob his head like it's jammin'

All the hot girls make it pop, pop, pop
Bad bitches with the bag say "ah-ya-ya"
If he ain't talking 'bout no money tell him "bye, bye, bye" (Boy bye!)
And if you see a mad hoe tell her "hah-hah-hah"

Hey!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe!
Don't get mad hoe, fuck a broke hoe!
Don't get mad hoe, get a bag hoe!

Ah!
