Lyrics:


Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back?
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back?
My arms are missing you, my lips feel the same way too
I tried so hard to be true, like I promised I'd do
But this boy keeps coming around, he's trying to wear my resistance down

[Chorus:]
Hey Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back
He calls me on the phone, about three times a day
Now my heart's just listening to what he has to say
But this loneliness that I have within keeps reaching out to be his friend

[Chorus]

Need your loving, need your loving

[Instrumental break]

I wanna say, I'm not getting any stronger, I can't hold out very much longer
Trying hard to be true, but Jimmy, he talks just as sweet as you

[Chorus]

Need your loving, need your loving
Need your loving, need your loving...
(Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back)

[Repeats out]
