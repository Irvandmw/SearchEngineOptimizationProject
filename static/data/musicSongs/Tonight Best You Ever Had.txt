Lyrics:


Ah, alright.

Ain't this what you came for?
Don't you wish you came more?
Girl what you're playing for?
Ah, come on
Come on, let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that
Twist that

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had

I don't wanna brag,
But I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag,
But I'll be the best you ever had

I hit you with the best stroke,
Freestyle and the breaststroke
'Til you're blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke
So what we gon' do now?
Fuck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had

I don't wanna brag,
But I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag
(I don't wanna brag)
But I'll be the best you ever had
(Give me a little bit of that light-skinned love)

[Ludacris:]
Luda, listen,
You ain't even gotta text me, no
Knowin' me and you got that mental telepathy
Meet me up at the spot,
I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga bread, stay poppin' up like a toaster
Nobody come close
To me and you together
Step under my umbrella,
We'll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm,
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
And yep I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the thriller in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
That's 'cause seven days a week you're my 5 course meal
For real!

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had

I don't wanna brag,
But I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag,
But I'll be the best you ever had
