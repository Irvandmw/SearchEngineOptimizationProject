Lyrics:


He was a, class clown
Lover all around
He was kind of goofy
Make you feel good when you're down
But one day he disappeared and never came back
At 17 got kicked out by his mother just like that
He moved in with his father
That he never grew up with
But we're not gon' get into that like cocaine we gon' cut it
He loved music, but never had the time
Cause he was working two jobs and they both was overtime
His girlfriend always told him that he was destined to shine
He smiled, said "really?" but really paid it no mind
And when he was of age the situation was shitty
So he packed up all his stuff and then he moved across the city
Went to the room from his homie's mom and dad
They saw the situation and they felt so bad
They let him live with 'em, and he was doing good
Working at the street fixing cars under their hood
He got up with his mentor, that he knew for a while
He met him back when he was a youngin' only a child
A real good guy
That gave him some equipment
And then he sent him packing like a UPS shipment
He said "lay some tracks, and maybe we can get it"
So then he quit his job and he moved in with his sister
They lived together as children so yes he really missed her
But then he got another job, still working on music
Tryna find a style and figure out how to use it
But one day he got it
Yes he's so excited
But then he stopped
Said I got a way to go on top, they gon' find me
Such a long journey like I'm walking I-90
Three thousand miles leaving the haters behind me
Along his path, he ran into a wise man
Said "please tell me how I let 'em know I'm great"
Wise man then said "drop a mixtape
But not just a regular shit that everyone doin'
You gotta let'em know that you for real on what you're pursuing"
Then he was gone, just as quick as he came
After this encounter he would never be the same
'Bout 100 miles and runnin', he started feelin' something
What's that?
Maturity
Every single night, sacrifice rest to write
Dusk 'till dawn he be rapping 'till the sun up
Call him super Mario he always get the one up
Finally dropping tracks, now the mixtape is completed
His appetite for perfection was seriously needed
Then it dropped
He would, sell it for twenty but his country in recession so
Take it for ten homie consider it a blessing
Yes he a rookie, but you know they respect him
That Botox flow, so whenever he inject 'em
Them haters tighten up their game but now it don't affect him
'Cause if they step out of line yeah you know he finna check 'em
He grew up on the bottom, but dreamt about the top
He finally found out that until he reach it he won't stop
He's headed to the summit, where everybody plummet
The game need change and Logic can break a hunnit
The consul to the game so you know we run it
Nah, that last line was, over dramatic
But he coming for that ass and he gon' let 'em have it
