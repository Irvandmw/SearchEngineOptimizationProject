Lyrics:


I never knew that you could do
What I needed to make me true
You've got me beat, I can't cheat
Here I sit on that mercy seat
My lovin' you is overdue
Girl, I'm making my way to you
I've been looking for your love too long
And now that I've found it, gotta keep it strong

So won't you give me all of your lovin'
Oh, don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
(Give me all, give me all)
Give me all of your lovin'
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin', yeah

All my friends, they wonder when
I'd be looking for love again
Can't they see, it's you and me
You're the flower, I'm the honeybee
I've been looking for a flower too long
With you is where this honeybee belongs

So won't you give me all of your lovin'
Oh, don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
(Give me all, baby, give me all)
Give me all of your lovin'
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
Give me all of your lovin'
(You know I sho'nuff need your lovin')
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
Give me all of your lovin'
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'

I never knew what love could do
'Til I fell in love with you
And now I see what's there for me
All love is is my girl and me
Heaven made me a world of my own
Where me and my baby could get along

So won't you give me all of your lovin'
Oh, don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
(Give me all, give me all, baby)
Give me all of your lovin'
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
(Give me all, give me, give me, give me...)
