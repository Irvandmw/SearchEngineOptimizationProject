Lyrics:


Well it's a darn good life and it's kinda funny
How the bee was made, the bee made honey
And the honey bee lookin' for a home
Made a honeycomb

Then they combed the world and they gathered all
Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball
And the honeycomb from a million trips
Made my baby's lips

Oh honeycomb, won't you be my baby
Well honeycomb be my own
Just a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
made a walkin', talkin' honeycomb
Well honeycomb won't you be my baby
Well honeycomb be my own
What a darn good life when you got a wife
Like honeycomb

Now have you heard tell how they made a bee
Then they tried a hand at a green, green tree
So the tree was made, I guess you heard
Up in, well they made a little bird

Now they waited around 'til the end o' spring
Savin' every note the bird did sing
And they rolled it up into one sweet tone
For my honeycomb

Honeycomb, won't you be my baby
Well honeycomb be my own
Just a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
made a walkin', talkin' honeycomb
Well honeycomb won't you be my baby
Well honeycomb be my own
What a darn good life when you got a wife
Like honeycomb

In a little while when they made that bird
They looked around for a little word
Sounded sweet as turtle dove
So they called it love

Then they went around lookin' everywhere
Takin' love from here, love from there
And they stored it up in a little cart
For my honey's heart

Oh honeycomb, won't you be my baby
Well honeycomb be my own
Just a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
made a walkin', talkin' honeycomb
Well honeycomb won't you be my baby
Well honeycomb be my own
What a darn good life when you got a wife
Like honeycomb
