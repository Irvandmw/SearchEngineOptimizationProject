Lyrics:


I woke up on early evening and I knew I was alone
Did the sun come up or did it rain again, Iâll never know
I felt the acid in my stomach rise above my throat as I dialled

There was a message from my mother
From about 7a.m. said Iâve forgotten what you sound like 
And Iâm wonderinâ how youâve been
I cried myself to asleep back on the floor
Unconscious in denial

Life is just a little part of what the world will do
To get itâs point across it beats you âtil youâre black & blue
And decides just when youâre in or when youâre out
âCause when youâre through youâre through

Thereâs a cafe around the corner from a home I call a house
I sit and play sudoku âtil I figure some shit out
I drink the dayâs first coffee and I smoke the last cigarette of my life

And Iâm wondering out of all the crazy places that Iâve been
Would it ever be as good as sittinâ here just with a friend?
Where it's always understood it might be time, to switch the coffee to the wine

Life is just a little part of what the world will do
To get itâs point across it beats you âtil youâre black & blue
And decides just when youâre in or when youâre out
âCause when youâre through youâre through

Yeah, Yeah.
Whoaaaah, Ohhhh. 
Whoaaaaahhhhhh

Ohhhh, Ohhh, Ohhh.
Oh.

Janis sings to me just like sheâs sitting by my side
And I wonder just how many times she sat like me and cried
Iâve made it past the age of twenty-seven so thereâs no use in dyinâ

And my friends have asked the question:
âBaby, will you be okay?â
I wanna tell them yes âcause I know thatâs what I should say
But Iâve got no crystal ball and I canât bring myself to lie and why should I?

Hey, yeahhhh - I think thatâ¦..
Life is just a little part of what this world will do
Itâs bring us to the brink and beats the shit right outta you
And decides just when youâre in or when youâre out
âCause when youâre through youâre through

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Life is just a little part of what the world will do
Itâs brings us to the brink and beats the sh1t right outta you
And decides just when youâre in or when youâre out
When youâre through youâre through

Ayyye, Oh.
I guess Iâm through
Mmmmm
When youâre through, youâre through.
