Lyrics:


These waterfalls, Iâve seen a million times
They wash away the world that I see, and cover up my mind
And I can push the walls away until theyâre out of sight and mind
But Iâm not strong enough to stand alone here in this tide

I donât want to, Iâm not trying
I wish it would just go away
And then I see red, I see red, I see red, I see red

These situations make me feel so cold
Itâs like Iâve been replaced by someone I donât know
And I can say the words until Iâve said all I can say
But without you Iâm a fraction of who Iâm supposed to be

Breathe me in and take me under
Crack these walls and letâs start again 
And then I see red, I see red, I see red, I see red
I see red, I see red, I see red, I see red

We can run, we can hide
But we canât live without it
Itâs the same in us, it takes the flame in us
And we can love, we can hate, we canât live without it
We're not alone, thereâs more to this

We can run, we can hide
But we can't live without it
It's the same in us, it takes the flame in us
And we can love, we can hate, we can't live without it 
We're not alone, there's more to this

Thereâs nothinâ left but the sound of my heart
Thereâs nothinâ left but the strings on this guitar
Take it all, take the hurt and heartache, help me start again
There's nothin' left but the sound of my heart
There's nothin' left but the strings on this guitar
Take it all, take the hurt and heartache, help me start again

And we can run, we can hide
But we canât live without it
Itâs the same in us, it takes the flame in us
And we can love, we can hate, we canât live without it
We're not alone, thereâs more to this

And we can run, we can hide
But we can't live without it
It's the same in us, it takes the flame in us
And we can love, we can hate, we can't live without it
We're not alone, there's more to this
