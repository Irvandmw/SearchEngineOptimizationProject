[Noah Cyrus:]
You just made the worst mistake
And you'll regret it, darling
'Cause once you give and then you take
You only end up wanting

Was everything not enough?
'Cause one day you'll wake up and then you'll say

I wanna be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend
You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)
I, I wanna be your lover
Baby, I'll hold my breath
You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)

[Noah Cyrus & XXXTENTACION:]
Again, babe
Again
Again, babe
Again
You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again

[XXXTENTACION:]
Ooh, she's screaming in my head
Ooh, I left her where I slept
Somewhere where I can't escape
I'm running from myself
Somewhere in between in love and broken, I'm in hell

[Noah Cyrus:]
Saying, "I wanna be your lover, I don't wanna be your friend"
You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)
I, I wanna be your lover
You're leaving when the clock hits ten
You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)

[Noah Cyrus & XXXTENTACION:]
Again, babe, again
Again, babe, again
You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)
Again, babe, again
Again, babe, again
You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me again)
