Lyrics:


Never seen someone make pink so pretty
Play make up and dresses litter the floor
Her smile's chasing her cheeks to her eyebrows
We'll laugh until our tummies get sore

Only five years old and she's so nervous
Daddy blows out candles and he sweats
Too young to understand this birthday
Will be the best gift Daddy ever gets

She said her body held a monster
And she needs help trying to fight it
And she knew that when he crossed her
That it was wrong but she could right it
And she took my hand

And I said, please put up your fists
Put on a smile, and blow them a kiss
'Cause darling you're nothing but brave
And I know that you can be saved

We're gonna chase down the monster
We're gonna chase down the monster

Glitter painted toenails and she stands tall
Says Momma, Santa's coming soon
Momma laughs and chokes her tears back
Says baby girl he's coming just for you

Only five years old and she's so precious
Sings to every song on the radio
Too young to understand that this one
Was written just for Ruby 'cause I know

She said her body held a monster 
And she needs help trying to fight it
And she knew that when he crossed her
That it was wrong but she could right it
And she took my hand

So darling don't you give up
Go and put your chin up
Show 'em that your strong enough when it gets rough
To last a second round

Darling please put up your fists
Put on a smile and blow them a kiss
'Cause darling you're nothing but brave
And I know that you can be saved

Put up your fists
Put on a smile and blow them a kiss
'Cause Ruby, you're nothing but brave
Oh, and I know that you can be saved

We're gonna chase down the monster
Yeah we can chase down the monster
We're gonna chase down the monster
Yeah we can chase down the monster
We're gonna chase down the monster
