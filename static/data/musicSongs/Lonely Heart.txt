Lyrics:


Your type of mind, so hard to find
Native from mine, you're just my kind
Down on my knees, I'll always follow
I promise you, until the end of time

Our house on fire
We're burning
We dance inside
You're hurting
If you leave me in the morning
I'll have such a-

Such a lonely
Heart
Oh, whoa, oh
Such a lonely
Heart
Oh, whoa, oh (Oh, whoa, oh)

If you can't find another reason to stay
Then I know, I'm gonna always have a
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Heart
Oh, whoa, oh (Oh, whoa, oh)
Heart

Your precious heart
Can't watch it break (Ooh, ooh)
So I close my eyes
While you walk away (Ooh, ooh)
Can I have a second chance?
Can I have another dance?
Can I start another life, with you? (Oh, oh, oh)
When I wake up in a haze
And I haven't slept in days
You're a thousand miles away

With such a lonely
Heart
Oh, whoa, uh
Such a lonely
Heart
Oh, whoa, uh (Oh, whoa, uh)

If you can't find another reason to stay
Then I know, I'm gonna always have a
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Heart
Oh, whoa, uh (Oh, whoa, uh)

Lonely
It ain't it nothing new
Nothing new to me
Nothing new to you (Oh, whoa, uh)
Lonely
It ain't it nothin new
Nothing new to me
Nothing new to you
Lonely
It ain't it nothing new
Nothing new to me
Nothing new to you (Oh, whoa, uh)
Lonely
It ain't it nothin new
Nothing new to me
Nothing new to you

Heart
Oh, whoa, uh

Such a lonely
Heart
Oh, whoa, uh (Oh, whoa, uh)

If you can't find another reason to stay
Then I know, I'm gonna always have a
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Heart
Oh, whoa, uh (Oh, whoa, uh)
Heart
