Lyrics:


Did you like when I put my lips there?
Cause I like when you're kissing me everywhere
Do you mind if we go back in one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Can we just get it in one mo' gen?

You give me that fever I ain't trying to break
Been a little while but I don't mind to wait
I'm gon' need a ride home now sooner than later
Must I reiterate, can we pick up the pace?

And once we lit this towering inferno
The flame keeps burning higher, hotter we go
And the temperature is rising, crack a window
Let's be the opposite of lonely
Come and give me what you owe me

Did you like when I put my lips there?
Cause I like when you're kissing me everywhere
Do you mind if we go back in one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Can we just get it in one mo' gen?

Ain't no use in being stingy with it
If you think you're getting off, forget it
And if you think it ain't all for you, you're wrong
Baby it's all for you
Addicted to you, come support my habit
Third person, yeah she gotta have it
If you think I'm on call for you, you're right
Baby I'm on to you

And once we lit this towering inferno
The flame keeps burning higher, hotter we go
And the temperature is rising, crack a window
Let's be the opposite of lonely
Come and give me what you owe me

Did you like when I put my lips there?
Cause I like when you're kissing me everywhere
Do you mind if we go back in one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Can we just get it in one mo' gen?
