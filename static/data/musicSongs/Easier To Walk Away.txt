Lyrics:


Every time you turn around, you wear another face
Every time I look away, I find a hiding place
If you knew me like you knew him, you would know just how I feel
Slipping through somebody's fingers, falling under someone's wheels

It's easier to walk away, better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom, walk away and don't look back

Never seen you looking back through smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to memories and fears
Just release me I can't take it, can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation, buried under someone's thumb

It's easier to walk away, better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom, walk away and don't look back
It's easier to walk away cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded, walk away and don't look back

Every time you turn around, you wear another face
Every time I look away find a hiding place

It's easier to walk away, better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom, walk away and don't look back, yeah
It's easier to walk away, better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom, walk away and don't look back
