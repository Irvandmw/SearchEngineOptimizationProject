Lyrics:


Hollywood whore,
Passed out on the floor,
I'm sorry but the party's over.

Cocaine nose,
And trendy clothes,
Gotta send her to rehab.
She found out she's got no soul,
But it really doesn't bother her.
White trash queen,
American dream-
Oh, what a role model.
Throwing a fit,
Making a scene,
Like no tomorrow.

Hollywood whore,
Passed out on the floor,
Can't take it no more,
I'm sorry but the party's over.
The talk of the town,
Is she's going down.
I'm sorry but the party's over NOW.

Awake by noon, drunk by 4.
Sucked up in the show biz.
You're so lame, 
You're such a bore,
I wanna kick your teeth in.
Plastic smile,
To match your style-
We can tell you got a face lift.
You're so vain, oh so vile, 
You're a number one hit.

Hollywood whore,
Passed out on the floor,
Can't take it no more,
I'm sorry but the party's over.
The talk of the town,
Is she's going down,
I'm sorry but the party's over.

The cameras are gone,
And nobody screams.
She couldn't survive her 15 minutes of fame.
Her friends are all gone,
She's going insane.
She'll never survive without the money and fame.
It's all going down the drain.

Hollywood whore,
Passed out on the floor,
I'm sorry but the party's over.
The talk of the town,
Is she's going down.
I'm sorry but the party's over

Hollywood whore,
Passed out on the floor,
I'm sorry but the party's over.
The talk of the town,
Is she's going down,
I'm sorry but the party's over.

Wake up!!!!!
The party's over 
[4x]
NOW

Hahaha

Don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya, hunny.
Hahaha...
