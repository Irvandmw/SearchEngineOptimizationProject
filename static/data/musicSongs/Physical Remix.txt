[Romanized:]

Seoroui nunchiman bojiman
Ne songmaeum deulkingeol aneungeol
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Gamjeongeul sogiryeo haneun neo
Sigan eopseo neon just wasting time
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree, bae?

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

I bameun heulleogago
Deoneun sumgiryeogo haedo uimieopseo
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
I bangui muneul datgo
Duri seoman hamkke haneun i gongganeseo
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

Hold on, neowa naui kemi
Come on, hold on, geobuhal su eopseo
Come on
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)

Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Physical (Physical, physical)
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Come on, phy-phy-phy-physical
