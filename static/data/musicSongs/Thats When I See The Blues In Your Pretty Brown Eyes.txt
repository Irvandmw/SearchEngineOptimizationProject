Lyrics:


(That's when I see the blues in your pretty brown eyes.)

You say it's over now but it's easy to see
You still belong to him you're not happy with me
You can hide all your feelings until he passes by
That's when I see the blues in your pretty brown eyes.

Your pretty brown eyes keep telling me lies
But they can't hide the hurt with a smile and disguise


You can hide all your feelings until he passes by
That's when I see the blues in your pretty brown eyes.

Your pretty brown eyes keep telling me lies
But they can't hide the hurt with a smile and disguise
You can hide all your feelings until he passes by
That's when I see the blues in your pretty brown eyes.

That's when I see the blues in your pretty brown eyes...
