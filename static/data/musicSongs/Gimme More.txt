Lyrics:


It's Britney Bitch
I see you,
And I just wanna dance with you

Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Your public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking, we keep on rockin'
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching, keep watchin'
Feels like they're probably saying

Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more

The center of attention
(Do you feel this?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position
If you're on a mission
You got my permission

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking, we keep on rockin'
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching, keep watchin'
Feels like they're probably saying

Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more

I just can't control myself
More
They want more?
Well I'll give them more

Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more

Gimme more
Gimme more
No, no no, no no, no more
Gimme more
Gimme more, babe

Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja

I just want more

No, no no, no no, no

Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme

Bet you didn't see this one coming
The Incredible Lago (more, more, more)
The legendary Miss Britney Spears
And the unstoppable Danja
Ah, you gonna have to remove me
'Cause I ain't going nowhere
