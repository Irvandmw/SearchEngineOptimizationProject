Lyrics:


Take your girlie to the movies if you can't make love at home
There's no little brother there who always squeals
You can do an awful lot in seven reels
Take your lessons at the movies and have love scenes of your own

When the picture's over and you have to leave
Don't forget to brush the powder off your sleeves
So take your girlie to the movies if you can't make love at home

Take your girlie to the movies if you can't make love at home
Take your girlie all alone
You should see how they maneuver in the dark
Take your tips from Tyrone Power and have love scenes of your own

Stealing kisses in the dark is just immense
Where can you get half as much for sixty cents
So take your girlie to the movies if you can't make love at home
Hey pops, if you can't make love at home
