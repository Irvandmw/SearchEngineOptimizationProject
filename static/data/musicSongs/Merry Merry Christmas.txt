Lyrics:


Ooh, Christmastime with you
I made a little list of my favorite things to do
I count one, two, three, four, up to ten
From the beginning until the end
Celebrating merry, merry Christmastime with you

So have a merry, merry Christmas
I'll have a merry, merry Christmas
I'll have a merry, merry Christmas
'Cause I spend it with you

So have a merry, merry Christmas
I'll have a merry, merry Christmas
I'll have a merry, merry Christmas
'Cause I spend it with you

Ooh, Christmastime with you
I made a little list of my favorite things to do
I count one, two, three, four, up to ten
From the beginning until the end
Celebrating merry, merry Christmastime with you

So have a merry, merry Christmas
I'll have a merry, merry Christmas
I'll have a merry, merry Christmas
'Cause I spend it with you

I'll have a merry, merry Christmas
I'll have a merry, merry Christmas
I'll have a merry, merry Christmas
'Cause I spend it with you
