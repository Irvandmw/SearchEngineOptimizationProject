Lyrics:


I woke up, it was 7
[One version:] I waited 'til 11
[Another version:] Waited 'til 11
Just to figure out that no one would call
I think I've got a lot of friends but I don't hear from them
What's another night all alone?

When you're spending everyday on your own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is
[One version:] Having more fun than me tonight
[Another version:] Having more fun than me

And maybe when the night is dead,
I'll crawl into my bed
[One version:] I'm staring at these 4 walls again
[Another version:] Staring at these 4 walls again
I'll try to think about the last time
I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go

And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me

[One version:] What the hell is wrong with me?
[Another version:] What the fuck is wrong with me?
Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?
Wide awake I'm bored and I can't fall asleep
And every night is the worst night ever

I'm just a kid [repeat x5]

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world.

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me tonight

I'm all alone tonight
Nobody cares tonight
Cause I'm just a kid tonight
