Lyrics:


Knowin' you, you probably got your toes in the sand
At a bar on a beach in the sun somewhere
Knowin' you, you got something cold in your hand
Chattin' up a stranger without a care
Knowin' you, you're still wild and free
And knowin' you, you're probably way over me

But, God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath till the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowin' you

Knowin' you was a free fall from a hundred thousand feet
When you don't even care where you land
And knowin' you was the kind of rush that you feel
When you finally get to sit in with the band
And knowin' you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

But, God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath till the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowin' you

Knowin' you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

'Cause, God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath till the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good
I'd do it all over
'Cause damn it was good knowin' you
