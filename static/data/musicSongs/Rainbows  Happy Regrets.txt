Lyrics:


Leave it alone or it won't get better
You shouldn't touch it at all
If there was a fire and
You tried to use it
It couldn't answer the call
It's like an old man
In a suit of armour
Standing alone in a shed
If I wasn't such a humanitarian
I'd think it better off dead

'Scotland forever' 'Erin Go Bragh'
How may I help you miss?
You bring such a passion to kiss
You're walking on tiptoes
You don't slurp your tea
The reason is plain to see
You grew up in a house with no TV

Give it some air
And a special cuddle
Don't let it see your concern
You are the judge
Let's have your ruling
It needs some friends
Don't say home schooling
Give it a wipe
Cos now it's drooling
Rainbows and happy regrets

'Scotland forever' 'Erin Go Bragh'
How may I help you miss?
You bring such a passion to your kiss
You're walking on tiptoes
You don't slurp your tea
The reason is plain to see
You grew up in a house with no TV

We live in an age of second chances
Even if they're undeserved
Now it's awake
I heard your calling
Up and away
There is no stalling
Here come those tears
It's loudly bawling
Rainbows and happy regrets
