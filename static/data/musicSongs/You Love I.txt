Lyrics:


[Backwards]
Uh, do I feel happy in life?

The end, I move back in
Before you know it, I cheated on him
Oh yeah, that's what happens when you don't try
You know I always thought about him
Even when the other boys sneak in
But infidelity would never even cross my mind

Wonderful, so wonderful
But, boy, don't get too comfortable
'Cause what we have's untouchable, ah, ah, ah
I stood deaf, 'til I stood dead
Un-tied a knot in my wedding dress
He got down on one knee and he said

You love I
You love I
You love I
Do I? Do I? Do I? Do I?

[Backwards]
Uh, do I feel happy in life?

Do I? Do I? Do I? Do I?

Oh oh, I move back out
He invited me into his fancy house
It's been so long we might as well try

Wonderful, so wonderful
You turned my heart into a puppet show
If you like me please let me know, ah ah ah
One day, the very first date
He walked on over and he asked my name
He could be the one to say

You love I
You love I
You love I
Do I? Do I? Do I? Do I?

I love you
I love you
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do

I do, I do, I do, I do
Do I? Do I?
You love I
I do, I do, I do, I do
Do I? Do I?
