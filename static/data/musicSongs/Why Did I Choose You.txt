Lyrics:


Why did I choose you?
What did I see in you?

I saw the heart you hide so well
I saw a quiet man who had a gentle way
A way that caught me in its glowing spell

Why did I want you?
What could you offer me?
A love to last a lifetime through

And when I lost my heart so many years ago,
I lost it lovingly and willingly to you
If I had to choose again,
I would still choose you

So if I had to choose again,
I would still choose you
