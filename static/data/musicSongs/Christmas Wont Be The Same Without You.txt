Lyrics:


It's the time of year 
When good friends 
Are near
Tryin' hard to find 
A quiet moment
Sharing love and joy 
Children 
With their toys
Sadness 
Fills my heart 
To see you go

[Chorus:]
Christmas 
Won't be the same 
Without you 
(Without you)
Christmas 
Won't be the same 
If you go
All I need to see 
Standing by 
My Christmas tree 
(Is you)
Christmas 
Won't be the same 
Without you

I remember 
When the times 
We used to spend
Walking hand in hand 
Until the sun sets
Then came Christmas eve 
The wish you gave to me
How I wish 
I tried to make you stay

Christmas 
Won't be the same 
Without you 
(Without you)
Christmas 
Won't be the same 
If you go
All I need to see 
Standing by 
My Christmas tree 
Without you

It's been a long 
Long time
I need you 
By my side
Hold me tight 
And don't let go
Let go

Christmas 
Won't be the same 
Without you 
(Without you)
Christmas 
Won't be the same 
If you go
All I need to see 
Standing by 
My Christmas tree 
(Is you)

Christmas 
Won't be the same 
Without you
Christmas 
Won't be the same 
Without you 
(Without you)
Christmas 
Won't be the same 
If you go
All I need to see 
Standing by 
My Christmas tree 
Without you

Christmas 
Won't be the same
Christmas 
Won't be the same
Don't go

Ooh
