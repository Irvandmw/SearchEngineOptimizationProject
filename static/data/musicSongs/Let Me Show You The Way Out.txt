Lyrics:


Uhh, yeah, uhh, yeah, check it
Didn't I make a good lady
Didn't I have your baby
Maybe I should have known you were crazy
When you was caught playin it shady

Didn't I keep your kids when you were out smokin and drinking
Why did I treat you like my king when you were out doing the wrong thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell you what I think about you(you)
Tired and confused(fused)
And I will not think to be with you
Sayin' what you think about me(me)
Think that I'm crazy(zy)
Think that Ill end up without you

[Chorus]
Let me show you the way
Let me break it down 
Let me show you how
Im gonna put you out
Watch me show and prove
Watch me make my moves
To get rid of you
You can pack your thangs
You can take this ring
It want be no thang
To the front door, cause 
I cant take no more
I cant take no more
Let me show you the way

(yeah, to the door
Let me show you the way)
Didn't I show you this good love
Didn't I do it just because
Tell me why you went and did me wrong
I heard you saying you loved her on the phone
But I doubted you when, even when you put me through it
Why didn't I listen to me girlfriend(girlfriend)
When they said you were not worth it, no

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
Uhh, ooh, yeah, haha, ooh

Since you went and broke the rules(ooh)
This is what I got for you(ooh)
Take your jacket and your shoes
You never play me for a fool

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell you what I think about you(you)
Tired and confused(fused)
And I will not think to be with you
Sayin what you think about me(me)
Think that I'm crazy(zy)
Think that Ill end up without you

[Chorus (2x)]
Let me show you the way
Let me break it down 
Let me show you how
I'm gonna put you out
Watch me show and prove
Watch me make my moves
To get rid of you
You can pack your thangs
You can take this ring
It want be no thang
To the front door, cause 
I cant take no more
I cant take no more
Let me show you the way

Uhh, who's laughin now?
Wa, wa, wa, [3x]
Yeah. wa, wa, wa [3x]
Let me show you the way.
