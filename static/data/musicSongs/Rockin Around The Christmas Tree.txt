Hey Girls! Hey Girls! [2X]

Hey, girls! We're rolling out. There's something in the air.
The world's a disco ball. The party is everywhere.

Drop the beat down. 1 2 1 2
When the beat down, we drop down too.
Drop the beat down. 1 2 1 2
What to do, what to do

Ring! Ring! Calling my girls!
Bring! Bringin' it to the whole world!
Keep singin' it! Ooooooh. (Whoo!)
Step! Step it out on the floor!
Right, left! 2, 3 & 4
One love! There's room for more!
'Cause when we get together, dancing till 2000 and forever
Ring! Ring! Calling my girls!
Bring! Bringin' it to the whole world!
Keep screamin' it! Oh, ohohoh.
Hey Girls! Hey Girls!

Drop the beat down. 1 2 1 2
When the beat down, we drop down too.
Drop the beat down. 1 2 1 2
What to do, what to do

Ring! Ring! Calling my girls!
Bring! Bringin' it to the whole world!
Keep singin' it! Ooooooh. (Hey Girls!)
Step! Step it out on the floor!
Right, left! 2, 3 & 4
One love! There's room for more!
'Cause when we get together, dancing till 2000 and forever
Ring! Ring! Calling my girls!
Bring! Bringin' it to the whole world!
Keep screamin' it! Oh, ohohoh.

Hey Girls! Hey Girls! [3X]
