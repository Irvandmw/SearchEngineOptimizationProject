Lyrics:


Wish I knew
Why you left
Now I seek and hope for the best
If I know that it maybe too late
But please don't walk away

I may have lost
But I don't regret
Yes I try and try
But I can't forget
And I know
That is probably too late
But please don't walk away

And hold on to the ones you love
Cause they may soon be gone
Hold on to the ones you love
Cause they could soon be gone

I will climb mountain
Just to see your face
Follow the eagle that's flying in you way
I will do it all
Yes if I could I would
Yes I will do it all

It's been long
It's over now
It's so hard not to miss
Or could it be found?
And yes I know
I know its too late
But why do you go away?

Hold on to the ones you love
Cause they may soon be gone
Hold on to the ones you love
Cause they will soon be gone.
