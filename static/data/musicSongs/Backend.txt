(Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)

Comin' with the money, got the backend with me (Ayy)
Nigga, better act like you hear me
I ain't gotta run up with the pack, come get it
I don't wanna hear you rap, I'm chillin'
I ain't got time, finna keep no ho
I don't really got no feelings
Really got rich and got to keep my soul
And that's a good goddamn feelin'
Comin' with the money, got the backend with me (Ayy, ayy)
Nigga, better act like you hear me
I ain't gotta run up with the pack, come get it
I don't wanna hear you rap, I'm chillin'
I ain't got time, finna keep no ho
I don't really got no feelings
Really got rich and got to keep my soul
And that's a good goddamn feelin'

You gon' have to leave
I fucked up the game, stay with the gang, so they after me (Yeah, yeah)
It's blood on my name and it left a stain, but I'm comin' clean (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I've seen shit I won't forget, it's all in my dreams (Ayy, ayy)
And whenever I trip, I still won't quit 'cause I want me (Me)
At the house with your bitch givin' her dick while you're out with your team (Uh-huh)
And it's no love for them, shit, they ain't got no love for me (Uh-uh)
I'ma keep fuckin' these fuck niggas' hoes
On the stage at my show with a pole in my jeans
And I still got that iron, I ain't talkin' clothes, I ain't talkin' crease (Huh, crease)
Now the money don't fold, I leave it at home, it's right here with me (Huh)
Bitch, I'm...

Comin' with the money, got the backend with me (Ayy)
Nigga, better act like you hear me
I ain't gotta run up with the pack, come get it
I don't wanna hear you rap, I'm chillin'
I ain't got time, finna keep no ho
I don't really got no feelings
Really got rich and got to keep my soul
And that's a good goddamn feelin'
Comin' with the money, got the backend with me (Ayy, ayy)
Nigga, better act like you hear me
I ain't gotta run up with the pack, come get it
I don't wanna hear you rap, I'm chillin'
I ain't got time, finna keep no ho
I don't really got no feelings
Really got rich and got to keep my soul
And that's a good goddamn feelin'

Huh, that's a good feelin' (Uh)
You ain't with the gang, fuck out the way, it's me and my niggas (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
'Member back in the day when we wasn't straight, they didn't feel us (Uh-uh)
Now we all got a plate and we eatin' steak 'cause we handle business (Yeah, yeah)
Now we all goin' baby (Baby on baby)
Got these broads goin' crazy (Huh, yeah)
'Fore they knew who I was (Who you?)
I was already blankin' (Yeah, blank)
Had them 'bows in the pantry (Huh, the pantry)
Got your by her ankles (Huh, her ankles)
Yeah I'm armed and I'm dangerous (Yeah, dangerous)
I will stop my performance and spank you (I'll beat one of these niggas us)
These niggas pussy, wanna send me to booking
I'm one deep in a hoodie, put that heat on a bully
And bitch, I'm...

Comin' with the money, got the backend with me (Ayy)
Nigga, better act like you hear me
I ain't gotta run up with the pack, come get it
I don't wanna hear you rap, I'm chillin'
I ain't got time, finna keep no ho
I don't really got no feelings
Really got rich and got to keep my soul
And that's a good goddamn feelin'
Comin' with the money, got the backend with me (Ayy, ayy)
Nigga, better act like you hear me
I ain't gotta run up with the pack, come get it
I don't wanna hear you rap, I'm chillin'
I ain't got time, finna keep no ho
I don't really got no feelings
Really got rich and got to keep my soul
And that's a good goddamn feelin'
