Lyrics:


I had enough of staring down at my shoes
Filling my cup with television's bad news
All of it's worthless, nothing to hold on to
Kicked out because there's nothing left but me and you

A little beat up but what you get's what you see
A bit of a rebel, a little bit of refugee
Waited my whole life away
Been waiting for someone like you to say

Hey, welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine wine, until you feel alright
Welcome to the good times

I'm always the one on the outside looking inside
Always the bridesmaid, never been the new bride
Sometimes I feel like a canary in a coal mine
It's hard to breathe but somehow it's got to stay in flight

Waiting for the dice to roll our way
We've been waiting for someone somewhere to say

Hey, welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine wine, until you feel alright
Welcome, forget about the hard times
Gonna make the sun shine if it takes all night
We'll say welcome to the good times

Welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine wine until you feel alright
Welcome, forget about the hard times
Gonna make the sun shine if it takes us all night
We'll say welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine wine until you feel alright, alright
Welcome, welcome to the good times
Take it in like fine wine, until you feel alright
Welcome, welcome to the good times
