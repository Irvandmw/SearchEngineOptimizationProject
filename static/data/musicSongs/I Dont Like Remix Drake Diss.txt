Lyrics:


[Verse 1: The Game]
Dact off that G6, hit the club on that gshit
Received a belt that's a G bitch and I'm bout to kill Chief Keef's shit
Just killed my nigga Meek's shit, Then I killed my nigga French's shit
Got a French bitch, no French shit but she giving my dick a French kiss
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like,
Arm hanging out the window with that black ghost, with them chrome pipes
Tell em niggas this gon' be a long night,
Bitches wanna chill we gon need some more ice
Shout out to John Wall, Man that nigga nice
Club leaning nigga we gon need some more sprite,
Real nigga, these Drake fans
Fuck charge, we gon take his stands, Take his fans we gon shake hands
Put a gap in your mouth, straight head
Hunnit racks of these cargos, push the button these cars go
Six trays of that lago, six spades black cards hoe
I got the homies out in Chicago, with the full clique with that bullshit
Dang nigga that's Rose, with the caps on and mj's
I got a thick bitch with a thin waist, got a condo so we slim steak
Got a Rolex Presidente, got black diamonds Kunta Kinte
Hot porn like turkin' em, hot weels we swervin' em
Next year we getting Derron Williams gonna do Lebron like Dirk and em'

[Verse  2: Chris Brown]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
They throwin' bottles I'm throwin' models, just cause I give a bitch long pipe
Doing shows on soccer fields that's dome right?
I be singing he be singing so its on fight
But hold up I didn't give a nigga no green light,
This head up, my bread up, one on one, what you scared bruh?
Matter fact, take care bruh you a pussy nigga, pay up
My nigga Tunechi, yeah that nigga nice, shout out to Nicki man that ass tight
Them eyebrows? Man them shits is yikes
OVO, you overdosed screamin' YOLO no I live TWICE ooops hahahaha

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A snitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A bitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
Sneak disser, thatâs that shit I donât like

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
They smile in my face is what I donât like
They steal your whole sound thatâs a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathinâ like they found Mike
A girlâll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phifer
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatinâ good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissinâ girls, cause itâs hot right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ainât about that life, they ainât about that life
We hanginâ out that window itâs about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, J Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louis, this is Chi, right?

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A snitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A bitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
Sneak disser, thatâs that shit I donât like
Donât like, like, donât like, like
A snitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like

[Verse 4: Chief Keef]
Fake Gucci, thatâs that shit I donât like
Smokinâ on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gonâ love me now, she gonâ let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, thatâs that nigga that I like
I donât want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, thatâs the shit that I donât like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I spend on a bunch of clothes, cause Iâm livinâ life
I come up on the scene, and Iâm stealinâ light
Bitch Iâm high off life, got me feelinâ right
Bitch Iâm Chief Keef, fuck who donât like
And bitch we GBE, we just gonâ cite

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Big Sean]
We are not one and the same, nigga Iâm fuckinâ insane, fuck is you sayinâ?
Yo ass been doinâ the same, shit, not doinâ what you sayinâ
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fuckinâ a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blow, blang, my niggas holdinâ that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang, ridinâ for my niggas and thatâs for life
High class Iâm just surrounded by these low-lives
And I run this bitch like itâs no lights
Goinâ hard the whole night cause I ainât goinâ back to my old life, I promise

[Verse 6: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, thatâs that shit I donât like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowinâ up my phone, thatâs that bitch I donât like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on âem just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, ânother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckers

[Hook]
