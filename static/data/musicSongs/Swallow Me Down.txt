Lyrics:


Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink

Uh, I blow your back out, I get it right to the trophy
This how I live, you know I live in the moment
All of that ass can't even fit in the camera
Swallow me down, it's hard to swallow this hammer
You know the plan, baby you're good with no hands
Swallow a rich nigga baby, just swallow these bands
I make it rain, I make you swallow that rain
Swallow me down, there's room for two on this thing

What you been sipping on lately baby?
No chaser, we drink it from the bottle
What you been tipping on lately baby?
I get to licking, that pussy be dripping so I drink, drink, drink, drink

Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
You ain't do this in a minute, I'mma be tripping
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink, drink
Gimme that batch, girl I'mma make you a winner, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down

Swallow me down, let me make love to your mouth
If we can't do that, then girl what we talking about?
Swallow me down, I bet your hero a zero
Swallow me down cause you need this Robert DeNiro
I like your face, girl I might give you my babies
I been to your crib, the people don't know that you crazy
I know you been fucking, I know what it is
I want that ass and them tittles, don't care if they real

What you been sipping on lately baby?
No chaser, we drink it from the bottle
What you been tipping on lately baby?
So I'll drink, drink, drink, drink

Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Swallow me down
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink, drink
Gimme that batch, girl I'mma make you a winner, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down

[French Montana:]
Swallow me down, swallow me down, shawty was fun, she swallow me now
Fresh out the trap, flip like I'm Goldie, Obama the Rollie, live for the moment
I won't lease what I'm owning, I ride like it's stolen
Roll up a Phantom, 4 in the Phantom, came in the Phanton, sniper no Ghost
Loaf in the carol, Ceasar cabana, left in the slammer, ride with the toast
Shawty gon' swallow, record a album, shawty was fronting now shawty gon' gobble
Came out the bottom, drink out the bottle, California love with the shit you get high with
I tell her she gon' be my bottom bitch, flying problem, fuck a condom
She wanna strip, took her to Vegas, she on a power trip
Making a living sucking dick and modelling, she giving paper to me like the lottery
I'm feeling way up, she hella fine with no make-up
Breakfast in bed, she be giving me head when I wake up, she swallow

[Chris Brown & French Montana:]
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink, drink
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down, drink, drink, drink
If you wasn't fucking with me then, don't fuck with me now
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down
Baby gimme that batch, girl I'mma make you a winner
Baby swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down

[Chris Brown & French Montana:]
Say my name when I pull out, vodka, cocaine and no powder
Pussy wet, fresh out the shower
Rolls came with a driver, shawty too fake to be honest
All that bitch want is them commas, knowing a nigga want is that money and power
All these women I done made, tired of making bitches famous
Tired of giving bitches names, falling in love can get dangerous
Please don't give your mind to nobody, help with that brain, I mean your body
Got a sickness, I got hoe problems, yeah I can flex but she don't swallow
