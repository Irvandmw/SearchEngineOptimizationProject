Lyrics:


When, when beauty fades from view, 
As worldly things will do, 
My eyes will still see you... 

When, when dreams turn old and gray, 
And seem to slip away, 
My dream of you will stay... 

Loving you, the way I do, 
Wanting you, needing you, 
Don't you know, can't you see, 
My love will flow eternally... 

Don't you know, can't you see, 
My love will flow eternally... 

And when, when evening shadows fall, 
And you are in my arms, 
I love you most of all... 

Loving you, the way I do, 
Wanting you, needing you, 
Don't you know, can't you see... [to fade]
