Lyrics:


Love for sale!
Advertising young love for sale
Who would like to pay the price for a trip to Paradise?
Love for sale!
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who would like to climb the stairs?
Who would like to try my wares?
Love for sale!

Let the poets fight for love in their childish ways
I know every type of love better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love
New love
Everything but true love!
Love for sale!
