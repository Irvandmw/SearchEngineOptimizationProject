Lyrics:


If at first she says no try again
If you meet with defeat try again
Don't forget at the start she won't part with her heart
Til you prove that it won't be in vain

So don't cry and don't sigh try again
Though the odds are one hundred to ten
Think how great the success when her answer is yes
And that's why you must try again

Don't forget at the start she won't part with her heart
Til you prove that it won't be in vain
So don't cry and don't sigh try again
Though the odds are one hundred to ten
Think how great the success when her answer is yes
And that's why you must try again
