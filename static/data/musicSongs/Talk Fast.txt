Lyrics:


I don't wanna think about a moment with you
I'm kinda hoping for forever
I've been dreaming 'bout a knitted sweater for two
Goddamn it, we look good together

Won't you wait a moment?
They're ringing the bell for last call
Won't you wait a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you

Leave all of your indecisions with you at home
Don't say you're doing me a favour
Why so complicated, won't you throw me a bone?
I want your love in every flavour

Won't you wait a moment?
They're ringing the bell for last call
Won't you wait a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you

Oh-oh-oh-oh ringing the bell for last call
Oh-oh-oh-oh ringing the bell for last call
Oh-oh-oh-oh ringing the bell for last call
Oh-oh-oh-oh ringing the bell for last call

Talk fast, romance

Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you

Talk fast, uh uh
Won't last, uh uh
Burn, crash, uh uh
Talk fast, uh uh
