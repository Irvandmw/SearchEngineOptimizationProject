Lyrics:


I don't wanna be scared no more
I just wanna turn my TV off
I don't wanna be talkin' 'bout it
It's too much for me, I'd rather not

Helplessly alone, there's nothing I can do
All together, we'll be starting something new

Show me a peace sign when there's no sign of peace
Show me a peace sign if you want to be free
I think this world has had enough
Need a little more love for everyone
Show me a peace sign when there's no sign of peace

Gonna make myself a promise
I won't change the way I live my life
As long as I got you, we got this
We'll break on through to the other side

Helplessly alone, there's nothing I can do
All together, we'll be starting something new

Show me a peace sign when there's no sign of peace
Show me a peace sign if you want to be free
I think this world has had enough
Need a little more love for everyone
Show me a peace sign when there's no sign of peace

Show me love, show me hate
Take a little time to appreciate
'Cause it's all by the choice you make
You can either love or you can hate
Show me love, show me hate
Take a little time to appreciate
'Cause it's all by the choice you make
You can either love or you can hate

Show me a peace sign when there's no sign of peace
Show me a peace sign if you want to be free
I think this world has had enough
Need a little more love for everyone
Show me a peace sign when there's no sign of peace
Show me a peace sign when there's no sign of peace
Show me a peace sign if you want to be free
I think this world has had enough
Need a little more love for everyone
Show me a peace sign when there's no sign of peace
