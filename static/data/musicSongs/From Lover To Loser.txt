Lyrics:


(From lovers to losers from lovers to losers)
From lovers to losers that's me that's me
For your lips aren't willing like they used to be
You once were so hungry for my embrace
Now goodbye is written all over your face
I'm fallin' from heaven for I know we're gonna part
The fall may not kill me but it's bound to break my heart
Yes lovers to losers you made that clear
I walked in a laughing but I'm leaving with tears
I'm fallin' from heaven...
