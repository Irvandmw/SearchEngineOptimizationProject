Lyrics:


[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
(Welcome to the South) Try to criticize us for how we live
And go do the same thangs that we just did, mmm
Better watch your mouth, try to criticize us for how we spit
Then say you respect the money that we get, mmm
(Welcome to the South) Must you criticize everything we did
Then expect at us to never even trip, mmm
We more than grilles and candy paint so be careful what you say
Cause we must just throw it right back in your face, hey
Better watch your mouth

[Chamillionaire]
Uhh, across the globe I hear the hate
The same whispers from state to state
If you didn't say it then this ain't for you
Don't worry 'bout it cause you can't relate
Before you buy me and you criticize me 
while you beside me let's get it straight
Cause you remind me of the kid beside me
Same rapper that you say you hate
Wanna criticize then fine (fine)
Said it's I've got simple rhymes (rhymes)
Every time I travel I'm 
in the backyard that act just like mine
Same grind just different times (times)
I know things done changed a lil'
Used to show our grills and they be like "Eww!"
Nowadays all say "That's ill"
I remember when a major label
wouldn't even come pay a visit
Used to say they have love for us but
they was blowin them suspect kisses
Now you watch and we see you plot 
and you can't act like we ain't suspicious
Shootin slugs just shoot at us 
but when you bust your thang it misses
Uhh, I ain't even much trippin 
cause I'm the man where I'm residin
So I'm decidin where I'm residin
so never tolerate domestic violence
I know you'd rather me just relax 
and sit back in silence
But I'm the owner, not just a client
so the South is what I stay advertisin

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire]
Don't knock the swagger, don't knock the swagger 
then turn around and be a swagger-jacker
If you a man then you should be a man
don't walk around without a Adam's apple
We was lookin at it from a distance 
but we wasn't trippin cause it had to happen
Styrofoam cup, and a Snapple 
and you actin like you been a fan of rappin
If you was hatin or participatin 
when you saw us up and never slidin through
You and everybody else that did it
It applied to them and it applied to you
You actin like somebody made you say it
Took your hand and then applied the glue
Turn around and gave the mic to you
and now you end up lookin like a fool
Can't polly us, come follow us 
and that's the reason I'm in the lead
The rest of y'all are some bench warmers 
and gettin mad cause I'm in the lead
I'm switchin speeds don't get fatigued
Y'all behind the line, y'all chasin me
Y'all finna see my energy
so ya get off my back and let a playa breathe
I won't lie and act like 
that I'm the one supportin everythang
Like Southern rappers ain't never lame
like some of these boys don't eff up the game
Most of us do our thang 
and the rest of 'em leave my ears in pain
But that's him and he sure ain't me 
so don't look at us like we all the same

[Chorus]

[Pimp C]
Uhh, South side candy rider never been a socializer
Flyin high, work grinder, knock your gal you can't find her
She was sittin on butter, hun'ned thousand under her ass
I was workin the wood circle smokin candy mashin on the gas
I can't be you I can't do you, I just do me, if you ain't
been where I been then you cain't, be who I be if you ain't
seen what I seen and you cain't, see what I see
I put the bricks, in the road there was slab on it wasn't free
Been a legend in the South since the year 9-3
"Pocket Full of Stones," menace to society
The hard in the cars, chrome-y fo's, not D's
Now everybody pimpin and they all got keys
Please you work, for UPS
They say they smokin dro but all I keep smellin is cress
I roll with the best, '92 me and Screw in the Lexus
I might not be nothin to you but I'm the {shit} in that Texas

(Welcome to the South...) [echoes]
