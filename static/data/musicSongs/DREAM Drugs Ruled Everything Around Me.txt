Lyrics:


[Miley Cyrus:]
You're in my bed uninvited
It's fine, 'cause I'm in the mood
Hope you don't mind if I spike it
We'll drink it, just me and you

And you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be sleeping on the red eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just getting started

Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me

Get the Ghost, raise a toast, pop the Molly
I can go toe-to-toe like I'm Ali
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

These planes are all UFOs and
This city's in outer space
It's better than where we came from
I think that we both should stay

'Cause you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be fucking on the red eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just getting started

Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me

Get the Ghost, raise a toast, pop the Molly
All the girls in my room look like Dolly
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me
(Drugs rule everything around me)
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

[Ghostface Killah:]
Drugs rule everything around me
You can call me a king
I got it all in my store
You should crown me
Purple, Percs, sticky green, Molly
Sippy lean
Got the white that's sure to light the floor like in Billie Jean
Scarface nights (nights)
Five hundred thousand on the pinky
Broadway ice
Ice, we throw diamonds at weddings
And y'all throw rice (rice)
Lollapalooza, Coachella custies, that's my type
Party all night
