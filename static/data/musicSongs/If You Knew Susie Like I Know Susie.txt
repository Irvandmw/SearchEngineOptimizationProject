Lyrics:


If You Knew Susie 
like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! Oh! What a girl!

There's none so classy 
as this fair lassie
Oh! Oh!

Holy Moses! What a chassis! 
We went riding 
she didn't balk 
Back from Yonkers 
I'm the one that had to walk! 

If You Knew Susie 
like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! Oh! What a girl!

She wears long tresses 
and nice tight dresses 
Oh! Oh!

What a future she posesses.  
Out in public 
how she can yawn 
in a parlor you would think 
the war was on.

If You Knew Susie 
like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! Oh! What a girl!
