Lyrics:


Gotta get back into your heart again
Change your mind, change your mind
The look you give me when you play your part to win
Change your mind, change your mind

'Cause losing you is easy but life's not long enough
To give you what I got now would hardly be enough, yeah
Change your mind, change your mind

'Cause losing you is easy but life's not long enough
To give you what I got now would hardly be enough, yeah
Change your mind, change your mind
