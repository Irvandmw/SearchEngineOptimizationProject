Lyrics:


Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere

Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away

And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I do

Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away

But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I do

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under ground now Iâ
Now I do

[Brad's guitar solo]

Little things give you away [4x]

[6x]
All you've ever wanted (little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
