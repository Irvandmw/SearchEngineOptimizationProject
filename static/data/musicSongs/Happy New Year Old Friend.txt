Lyrics:


Happy new year, old friend
The season's come to an end
We'll lift a glass once again
Happy new year, old friend
Seems like just yesterday
We were here face to face
Let our new memories begin
Happy new year, old friend

On a night like tonight
When the band's feeling loose
And they'll follow our lead
'Cause we know what to do
Singing Auld Lang Syne
As I pull you in close
And this moment is all that we know

Happy new year, old friend
The season's come to an end
We'll lift a glass once again
Happy new year, old friend

On a night like tonight
When the band's feeling loose
And they'll follow our lead
'Cause we know what to do
Singing Auld Lang Syne
As I pull you in close
And this moment is all that we know

Happy new year, old friend
The season's come to an end
We'll lift a glass once again
Happy new year, old friend
