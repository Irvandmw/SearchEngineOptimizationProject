Lyrics:


Fame be like, like when you rich and famous and shit
They think you supposed to act a certain way
I'm a little lit on the tour bus so I'ma act a certain way
Mike Holland we recordin'?
Whoa that my mirror?

Hey

Who got the juice like me?
Who got the juice like, who got the juice like (Bobby)
I'm finna give her the D, end of the night
She gon' be screamin', be screamin' (Bobby)
Who sell out arenas? Who spit it the meanest?
Who's bi-racial only in his penis? (Bobby)
My shit the cleanest, I'm a fuckin' genius
Self-proclaimed but they know the name (Bobby)
Who got the juice like me?
Who got the juice like, who got the juice like (Bobby)
I'm finna give her the D, end of the night
She gon' be screamin', be screamin' (Bobby)
Who sell out arenas? Who spit it the meanest?
Who's bi-racial only in his penis? (Bobby)
My shit the cleanest, I'm a fuckin' genius
Self-proclaimed but they know the name (Bobby)

I guess when you make it this big
People assume your head this big (Bobby)
Start takin shots, yeah they pour the drink
In person they blow smoke like a cig
Shorty gon' pass me the head till I nut
I am so rich that I don't give a fuck
Me and my homies we smoke in the cut
Momberg, like what?
I just performed for like fifteen thousand
I leave these women arousin'
All the pussy in the club made a tidal wave
Come on now Bobby boy behave
Black and white, you ain't half of the nigga I am
You just mad you ain't as big as I am
Real MC, your shit Sam I am
Been awhile, can I get a "God damn"?
I am the best in my field like a slave
Who said fuck emancipation, burned the plantation
Facing death, and then put the master in his grave
Why? 'Cause black is beautiful
Snappin' so hard I might snap a cuticle
Fifty million in the bank, know my circle like a tank
Think you can get in, you can't
Kiss a bitch a hand and she faint
Kiss a bitch a hand and she faint

Who got the juice like me?
Who got the juice like, who got the juice like (Bobby)
I'm finna give her the D, end of the night
She gon' be screamin', be screamin' (Bobby)
Who sell out arenas? Who spit it the meanest?
Who's bi-racial only in his penis? (Bobby)
My shit the cleanest, I'm a fuckin' genius
Self-proclaimed but they know the name (Bobby)
Who got the juice like me?
Who got the juice like, who got the juice like (Bobby)
I'm finna give her the D, end of the night
She gon' be screamin', be screamin' (Bobby)
Who sell out arena? Who spit it the meanest?
Who's bi-racial only in his penis? (Bobby)
My shit the cleanest, I'm a fuckin' genius
Self-proclaimed but they know the name (Bobby)

Man, you know, he don't fuck with nobody
You know why?
'Cause all y'all niggas is talkin' a bunch of bullshit
And you know, you can't back up what ya say
Because ya mouth say one thing, and yo actions show another
Then you can't back it up
So what the fuck you gon' do?
This is Logic's dad, this is Bobby Smoky Hall
And he came out my balls (Bobby)
