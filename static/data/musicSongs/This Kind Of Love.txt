Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I love the way it feels
To sit behind the wheel
Of a brandnew automobile
I love the way
A song can start to play
And take you back to younger days

[Chorus]
I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight
Holding you
I realize that I've never known
This kind of love

Sometimes its hard
To let down your guard
And trust somebody with your heart
I know how
It feels when they walk out
And leave it in pieces on the ground

[Chorus]
Oh I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight
Holding you
I realize that I've never known
This kind of love

It's deeper and stronger
And lasts a whole lot longer
It's more than a word that people say

[Chorus]
Because I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight
Holding you
I realize that I've never known
This kind of love

This kind of love
Mmmmmmmmmmm...
