Lyrics:


Honey, feels like my world's burned down
I'm trying to put it out
I'm trying but don't know how
Honey, I'm drowning in all my doubt
I'm trying to start again
I try but I'm struggling

Ooh, after all this time got nothing to lose
Ooh, after all this time see nothing but you

You might say I'm wasted on you
But when you break, I'll break for you too
Love can beat us black and blue
But, darling, I'll take the punches for you
Punches for you
Punches for you
Love can beat us black and blue
But, darling, I'll take the punches for you

Darling, the good intentions
Keep running in circles
I'm fading out like a ghost
Oh, darling, you're making the same mistakes
But I'm trying to start again
I try but I'm struggling

Ooh, after all this time got nothing to lose
Ooh, after all this time see nothing but you

You might say I'm wasted on you
But when you break, I'll break for you too
Love can beat us black and blue
But, darling, I'll take the punches for you
Punches for you
Punches for you
Love can beat us black and blue
But, darling, I'll take the punches for you

Darling (darling)
Darling (darling)
Darling (darling, darling, darling)
Darling

Like a map faded in time
Like an old-forgotten tomb
I know love has been unkind
For the two of us

And you might say that I've been fooled
But when you break, I'm breaking too
Love can beat us black and blue
But, darling, I'll take the punches for you

Punches for you
Punches for you
Punches for you
Punches for you (punches for, punches for)

Punches for you
Punches for you
