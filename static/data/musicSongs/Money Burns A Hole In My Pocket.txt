Lyrics:


Money burns a hole in my pocket
How I wish I had millions of dollars and nothing to do
But just buy pretty presents for you

Money burns a hole in my pocket
How I wish I had oil wells in Texas to keep me supplied
With money while I sit by your side

Every day of the week
We would visit the store
All the beautiful things you see
Would soon be yours
Cuz money burns a hole in my pocket
So I'm bringing your perfume and candy and roses of red
And wishing they were diamonds instead

Every day of the week
We kinda visit the store
All the beautiful things you see
Would soon be yours
Money burns a hole in my pocket
So I'm bringing your perfume and candy and roses of red
And wishing they were diamonds instead
