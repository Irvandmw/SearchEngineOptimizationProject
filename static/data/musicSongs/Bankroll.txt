Lyrics:


[Lil Mosey:]
Ooh, ooh
Ayy, ooh, ooh
Ooh

Doubled up my bankroll
Gucci socks, my pants fall
I bust down my ankle
See you fuck niggas from my angle
Doubled up my bankroll
Gucci socks, my pants fall
I bust down my ankle
See you fuck niggas from my angle

I just got a mill'
I feel like I won, won, won
Don't get yourself killed
We gon' get that shit done, done, done
You know I be in the field
See your ice we're gonna run, run, run
I just signed another deal
Put my shoes for some fun, fun, fun
Why you ringin' my phone?
Rollin' up, guess I'm gone
Damn that bitch she give me dome
And I gotta leave her by the morning
I turned nothing into something
Yeah, all my niggas straight bossin'
Everyday I'm dumpin'
Pour a 4 or something (The lean)

Doubled up my bankroll
Gucci socks, my pants fall
I bust down my ankle
See you fuck niggas from my angle
Doubled up my bankroll
Gucci socks, my pants fall
I bust down my ankle
See you fuck niggas from my angle

[AJ Tracey]
Pink notes in my bankroll
Ran outta space on my wrist I got way too many pointers
Now I had to buss my ankle
Like, I hit the 3 from an awkward angle

Mosey know he good in Londonnnn
Twin glockies in the functionnnn
Feds are on me with the trunction
Fuck them shottas man we bumped em
Oh yeahhhh

I'm that nigga that your bitches adore
I'm in stoney you ain't seen this before
If this music doesnt work then I'm kickin a door
If she cute and got a fatty then I'm hittin it raw

My choker two tone like my skin tone
Two iPhones and a brick phone
When silly girls ring it I just hit home
And it's only chief keef on my ring tone

[Lil Mosey:]
Doubled up my bankroll
Gucci socks, my pants fall
I bust down my ankle
See you fuck niggas from my angle
Doubled up my bankroll
Gucci socks, my pants fall
I bust down my ankle
See you fuck niggas from my angle

Ugh
All angles
Yeah, ugh-uh
