Lyrics:


Following a line
Running from the past to the present
I become a boy
Paddling in the sea
I search for the peace
That I felt at that moment
And then it comes
Then it comes
Then it comes to me

Travelling a road
Driving through the heart of this country
I become a youth
Age of seventeen
I don't want the rage
That I felt in that era
But then it comes
Then it comes
Then it comes to me

We're only here for a short while
Makes me think of a quiz
I wonder how you measure
What a short while is?

Listening to applause
For backward decisions
I marvel at the power
Of rank stupidity
I had always laughed
At fear of the future
But then it comes
Then it comes
Then it comes (then it comes)
Then it comes to me
