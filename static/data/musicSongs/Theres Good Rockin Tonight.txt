Lyrics:


Well did you hear the news there's good rockin' tonight
Yeah heard the news everybody's rockin' tonight
Well I'm gonna hold my baby as tight as I can
Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty mighty man
I heard the news there's good rockin' tonight

Well I said meet me in a hurry now don't be late
The band starts rockin' about half past eight
I want you to bring along your rockin' shoes
Tonight we're gonna rock away all our blues
I heard the news there's good rockin' tonight

Well we're gonna rock, let's rock, yeah come on and rock
Mmm we're gonna rock, well let's rock all our blues away

Yeah let's rock now!

Well I said meet me in a hurry now don't be late
The band starts rockin' about half past eight
I want you to bring along your rockin' shoes
Tonight we're gonna rock away all our blues
I heard the news there's good rockin' tonight

Well we're gonna rock, let's rock, yeah come on and rock
Woo! we're gonna rock, well let's rock all our blues away
