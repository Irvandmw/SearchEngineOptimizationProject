Lyrics:
Lyrics:


You crossed an ocean's worth of teardrops
A million dollars worth of gloom
Since you've gone, it has cost me a lot
I paid for loving you
I paid for loving you

Give me all the tea in China
All the gold from old Peru
It couldn't pay for the sleep that I've lost
All from lovin' you, mmm
I paid for loving you

I try to smile and forget the past
But all I do is cry
Nothin's broker than a broken heart
So broken I could die
So broken I could die

If I were king and had a palace
I'd tell you just what you could do
I'd trade it all for just one more chance
A chance at lovin' you once again
I paid for lovin' you, mmm
I paid for loving you, uh-huh
I paid for loving you, uh-huh
I paid for loving you, yes I did
