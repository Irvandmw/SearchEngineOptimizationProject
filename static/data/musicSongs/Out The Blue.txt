Lyrics:


Out the blue you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue life's energy
Out the blue you came to me

Every day I thank the Lord and Lady
For the way that you came to me
Anyway it had to be two minds
One destiny

All my life's been a long slow knife
I was born just to get to you
Anyway I survived long enough
To make you my wife

Like a U.F.O. you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue life's energy
Out the blue you came to me
