Lyrics:


Looted and brought to the Louvre
Flesh just as plump as a baby's
Bet you see more than I do
Looking beyond the truth

Bonjour mon amis!
Hope this won't sound mean
But you stand alongside Britain
As thieving scum supreme
Yet I stand here with you
48th in line
Just to gaze in wonder
It happens every time

Looted and brought to the Louvre
Skin just as pink as a lady's
I bet you see more than I do
Looking beyond the truth

And your eyes follow me
All around the room
Watching soldiers wielding guns
They're loaded, I presume

But there's so many people
Making so much noise
Let me stop right here
So I can hear your voice
You're a work of genius
Passed from hand to hand
Now I observe something
I can't quite understand

Looted and brought to the Louvre
Face just as fair as a daisy's
I bet you see more than I do
Looking beyond the truth

You were looted and brought to the Louvre
Flesh just as plump as a baby's
I bet you see more than I do
Looking beyond the truth
