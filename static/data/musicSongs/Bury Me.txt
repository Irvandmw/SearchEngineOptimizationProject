Lyrics:


Every whisper
Is like a symphony to me
And every morning
Another opportunity
To be with you, the one I love
See you shining in the sun
And every evening
In the blankets, bury me
Bury me

Sinking slowly into your heart
I will always be where you are
Dig a hole for me in your soul
Pull me in and don't let me go
No no

Bury me, bury me
Lay your loving down upon me
Let it rain down on my body
Bury me, bury me
Suffocate me with your love
Yeah I can never get enough
Please bury me

Bury me, please bury me

Every picture
Of you is like a masterpiece
And every love song
We're toe to toe and cheek to cheek
To dance with you, the one I love
Hold you close and turn you up
And every midnight
Come to bed and bury me
Bury me

Sinking slowly into your heart
I will always be where you are
Dig a hole for me in your soul
Pull me in and don't let me go
No no

Bury me, bury me
Lay your loving down upon me
Let it rain down on my body
Bury me, bury me
Suffocate me with your love
Yeah I can never get enough
Please bury me

Bury me, please bury me
