Lyrics:


I felt it
The wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter
I never saw it coming
I started to black out and
Then someone said good morning
I took it as a warning
I should have seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on
This thing we may have started
Intentional or not I
Don't think we saw it coming
It's all adding up to something
That asks for some involvement
That asks for a commitment
I think I see it coming
If we step out on that limb

My heart beat beats me senselessly
Why's everything got to be so intense with me?
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot and I say why not
If I say forget it I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'Cause you're the best I've got
So take the long shot

I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about but
We'll never see 'em coming
Throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing
And do this fully knowing
We'll never see it coming
'Til it's much too close to stop

My heart beat beats me senselessly
Why's everything got to be so intense with me?
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
And all probability

It's a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'Cause I'm the best you got
So take the long shot

Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming
But we'll make it even though

It's a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take the long shot

You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw me coming
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw this coming

I take the long shot
I take the long shot
Shot, shot, shot, shot
'Cause you're the best I got

Oh, I'm take this chance on you, baby
I'm take this chance on you, baby
I'm taking this chance...
