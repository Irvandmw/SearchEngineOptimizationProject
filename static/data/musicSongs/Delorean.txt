Lyrics:


Hey boy, this could be your life
I said "Hey girl, you could be my wife"
I said "Hey man, don't take this shit too far"
I said "Woman, take a step inside my car"

Could only imagine, the things that could happen
But you let go and ran away
Only imagine, the things that could happen
My only comparison is night and day
Only imagine, the things that could happen
But you let go and ran away
Only imagine, the things that could happen
My only comparison is night and-night and-night and day (Ooo)
Ooo

Take a trip inside of my DeLorean
Back to the future where everyone's been dead for a long, long time
Oh, the past-the past-the past (Past, past)
We already know what happens, when it happens

Could only imagine, the things that could happen
But you let go and ran away
Only imagine, the things that could happen
My only comparison is night and day
Only imagine, the things that could happen
But you let go and ran away
Only imagine, the things that could happen
My only comparison is night and-night and-night and day (Ooo)
Ooo
