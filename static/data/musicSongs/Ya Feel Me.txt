Lyrics:


(Young Tina Snow going hard on a hoe, ah)

Pussy so good got him talking like Yoda
I need a bae with a mouth like a motor
Her pussy nasty she drink too much soda
I got that Alkaline chocha, that water
Walking 'round with all that hate let it go
I cannot stay out the damn Gucci store
I like drink but I don't do no dope
My body banging he want all the smoke
Eh boo bitch
Don't do me, do you bitch
I'll send a check in the bank right now
Open up shit like she you bitch hey
I'm riding around with my African
My nigga stiff like a mannequin aye
Hotter than you cause they jamming me yeah
These niggas love me like family aye uh
I'm on they head like I jacked in they face
All these hoes look alike like they traced
Bitch I'm the pencil, the paper, the case
Hoe it is nothing to get you erased
I knock the breath out these bitches
They wheezy
I feel in love with the cash
It complete me
Yo bitches slutty, mcnutty she easy
Give a fake cat to a nigga no reason

I'm a raw ass bitch
Ya feel me
Aye, Ts, I'm hot
Ya feel me
Watch how you coming
Ya feel me
Ain't gotta touch me to
Ya feel me
Bitches ain't hotter than me
Ya feel me
I'm who they tryna be
Ya feel me
You know you got that from me
Ya feel me
I make 'em follow my lead
Ya feel me

Bye nigga
Hot girl pussy too fye nigga
I run game like five niggas huh
Magazine mami, got style nigga
Click on a bitch like a camera
Real big ol' titties like Pamela
Bitch I'm a pro, you a amateur
Hoe you a egg I'ma scramble you
These niggas fuck and go tattle tell
These niggas and bitches is parallel
I'm tryna get Ms and you takin' Ls
I got some game for you that I can sell
Wake up and get you some money
How you a hoe and you hungry
Bitch you ain't playing, you funny
You just a regular dummy

And I'm a raw ass bitch
Ya feel me
Aye, Ts, I'm hot
Ya feel me
Watch how you coming
Ya feel me
Ain't gotta touch me to
Ya feel me
Bitches ain't hotter than me
Ya feel me
I'm who they tryna be
Ya feel me
You know you got that from me
Ya feel me
I make 'em follow my lead
Ya feel me

He feel in love with these verses
I told him lick on this pussy in cursive
If she ain't the stallion he finna curve her
Fuck with my milk on a pea [?]
I got that lil mermaid that fresh outta water
Boy I'm the plug and the muhfuckin charger
Bitch I got the sauce ain't talkin' no tarter
These bitches study lil Megan, I taught them
Giving you rap and giving you sex
I'm writing bars while he giving me neck
He puttin' money on me like a bet

So hoe come correct aye

I'm a raw ass bitch
Ya feel me
Aye, Ts, I'm hot
