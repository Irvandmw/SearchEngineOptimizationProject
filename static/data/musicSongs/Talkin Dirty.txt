DJ Drama
Hey!

I'm the nigga you like
He ain't even your type, girl
I put it down every time we do it
You be talkin' dirty to me
Oh, 'cause how I do it to your body
Baby girl, you talkin' dirty to me
Oh, 'c-cause I do it right, yeah (Yeah)
Damn, girl (2 Chainz!)

Whisper sweet nothing's in your earlobe
Real slow, when I touch down in your field goal (Yeah)
I left the party, to the after party (Party)
Left the after party with you alcoholics
In the suite with you, my t-shirt for pajamas and
Them niggas ballin', then they switchin' like Juwanna Man
At first, shawty sayin' that she wanna man
Now she sayin' that she want a band (Damn)
This for the bowlegged girl at Onyx
Meant to say the bowlegged girl at [?]
If I was in the NBA, I be hoopin' in Dolce & Gabannas
This right here is so contrary
I'm so cold, I might need a Monclair
My money long, I got long hair
I like Giuseppe so much, I bought four pair, ooh

I'm the nigga you like (I am)
He ain't even your type, girl (Nah)
I put it down every time we do it
You be talkin' dirty to me (Say what, say what)
Oh, 'cause how I do it to your body (Say what, say what)
Baby girl, you talkin' dirty to me (They gettin', hey)
Oh, 'c-cause I do it right, yeah
Damn, girl

Shawty sent a text, "I wanna FaceTime" (I do)
I don't wanna talk, I want face time (Cyeah)
Talkin' ass fat, can't see her waistline (Woo)
Straight to point, I don't waste time (Waste time)
I ain't spendin' no money, I'm a real nigga (I am)
Pussy been free since a lil' nigga
If it don't come with no receipt, I ain't buyin' it
But I'll take it 'round the world, yeah, I'm flyin' it
Yeah, come on trips and shit
If the pussy good, you get gifts and shit
I'm talkin' double Cs and Givenchy bag
Know you ain't a bad bitch if you ain't got swag (Haha)
Shawty look right, always say the right shit
Hair long, real or fake, plus she gun thick
She a puller, not a ho, on that fun shit
Got me thinkin' to myself, "You the one, bitch"

I'm the nigga you like (You like, baby)
He ain't even your type, girl (No)
I put it down every time we do it
You be talkin' dirty to me
Oh, 'cause how I do it to your body (Yeah)
Baby girl, you talkin' dirty to me (Ooh, now, now, now)
Oh, 'c-cause I do it right, yeah
Damn, girl

Dick too bomb, she don't wanna leave me (Wanna leave me)
She wantin' that money, better come see me (Come see me)
Want it right now, she ain't tryna wait (Tryna wait)
She wanna know how a nigga pay (Pay)
That's on the dead homies
She don't even know me, for real
Put them legs up, then I eat it up
Throw it at me, I'ma catch it (Catch it)
And you already know I'm ready
Seein' you twerk it, baby, you puttin' that work in
Because I

I'm the nigga you like (You like, baby)
He ain't even your type, girl (No)
I put it down every time we do it
You be talkin' dirty to me
Oh, 'cause how I do it to your body (Yeah)
Baby girl, you talkin' dirty to me (Ooh, now, now, now)
Oh, 'c-cause I do it right, yeah
Damn, girl
