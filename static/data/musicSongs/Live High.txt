Lyrics:


I try to picture the girl
Through a looking glass
And see her as a carbon atom
See her eyes and stare back at them
See that girl
As her own new world
Though a home is on the surface, she is still a universe

Glory God, oh God is peeking through the blinds
Are we all here standing naked
Taking guesses at the actual date and time
Oh my, justifying reasons why
Is an absolutely insane resolution to live by

Live high
Live mighty
Live righteously
Taking it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously

I try to picture the man
To always have an open hand
And see him as a giving tree
See him as matter
Matter of fact he's not a beast
No, not the devil either
Always a good deed doer
And it's laughter that we're making after all

The call of the wild is still in order nation wide
In the order of the primates
All our politics are too late
Oh my, the congregation in my mind
Is this assembly singing of gratitude
Practicing their loving for you

Live high
Live mighty
Live righteously
Taking it easy
Live high
Live mighty
Live righteously

And sing it out
And just take it easy
And celebrate the malleable reality
You see, nothing is ever as it seems
Yet this life is but a dream

Lift me up to the almighty
Raise your hands and start acknowledging
If your living it righteously
Then you're living the easy way
Just, just, take, taking it easy

Live high
Live high
Live mighty, mighty, mighty
Oh live righteously
And taking it easy

Live high
Live high
Live mighty
Lift me up to the almighty
Oh live righteously.
Live it righteously.
And just take, just-just taking it easy

Live high
Live mighty
Celebrate the malleable reality
Live it righteously.

Sing it now
Just, take it, take it easy.
Saying living it high
Oh live righteously.
Just take it easy.
