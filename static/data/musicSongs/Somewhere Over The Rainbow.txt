Lyrics:


Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dared to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow why
Oh why can't I
