All these
All these

Ayy, I'm not supposed to be cryin' over you
But you the one I wanna be closer to
On your line, I'm waitin' on ya comin' through
Oh (Yeah)

It's all these flashbacks
Make me wish I had you back, yeah (Yeah)
Backtrack
I ain't tryna backtrack, no (No)
I shouldn't have put my all in that
'Cause breakin' up is like a heart attack

'Cause I don't wanna live without you
No, no, no I don't (Yeah)
'Cause I, I go crazy here without you, baby (I go crazy)
I do, I do
Don't wanna go a day without you (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Oh, whoa
I just can't see me without you, babe
Yeah, my love, oh no no

'Cause you on one
When you loved me, you stole one
They can't take you from me, yeah
We both say we don't (Yeah)
But we know the truth now
And I don't want nobody else fuckin' with you now

Oh, flashbacks
Make me wish I had you back, yeah (Yeah)
Backtrack
I ain't tryna backtrack, no (No)
I shouldn't have put my all in that
'Cause breakin' up is like a heart attack

'Cause I don't wanna live without you
No, no, no I don't (Yeah)
'Cause I, I go crazy here without you, baby (I'm going crazy for real, huh)
Oh, oh
Don't wanna go a day without you (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Oh, whoa (Yeah)
I just can't see me without you, babe (Can't see me, can't see me)
My love, oh

I ain't trippin', I'ma skrrt off and I blow the roof, yeah
Lick it all, that drippin' water, I'm lovin' your juice, yeah
They won't see us when they see us in the Bentley coupe, yeah
Windows tinted, when I'm kissin' on that pretty cooch, yeah
All these flashbacks
Damn, I wish I had you back
Sc-Sc-Scratch that
I be in my head all gassed
But I know you love me

(And I don't, I don't)
'Cause I don't wanna live without you (No)
No, no, no I don't (I go)
'Cause I, I go crazy here without you, baby (Crazy without you)
Oh, oh (Ooh)
Don't wanna go a day without you (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Oh, whoa
I just can't see me without you, babe (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
My love, oh no no
