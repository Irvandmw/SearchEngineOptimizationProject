Lyrics:


Sentimental me, guess I'll always be
So in love with you, say you love me too
Sentimental me

Dreaming while I live, living just to give
All my love to you, no one else will do
Sentimental me

Reaching for the moon
And no wishing on the stars
On my honeymoon
I want to be where you are

Darling, can't you see? It was meant to be
I'm in love with you, say you love me too
Sentimental me

Reaching for the moon
And no wishing on the stars
On my honeymoon
I want to be where you are

Darling, can't you see? It was meant to be
I'm in love with you, no one else will do
Sentimental me
