Lyrics:


(Why not)

You act like you don't know me
When you see me on the street
You're makin' like I turn you off
When I know you think I'm sweet

It don't have to be like that
I guess you're insecure.
If you say what's on your mind
I might answer 'Sure'

So I walk a little slower
And I try to catch your eye.
Sometimes it's so hard to see
The good things passing by.

There may never be a sign,
No flashing neon light,
Telling you to make your move
Or when the time is right.

[Chorus:]
(So) Why not (why not)
Take a crazy chance
Why not (why not)
Do a crazy dance
If you lose the moment
You might lose a lot
So... why not
Why not

(Why not take a crazy chance)
(Why not take a crazy chance)

You always dress in yellow
When you wanna dress in gold.
Instead of listening to your heart
You do just what you're told.

You keep waiting where you are
For what you'll never know.
Let's just get into your car
And go, baby, go!

[Chorus]

Oh... oh
I could be the one for you
Oh... yeah
Maybe yes,
Maybe no.
Oh... oh
It could be the thing to do
What I'm saying is
You gotta let me know.

You'll never get to heaven or even to L.A.
If you don't believe there's a way...

Why not (why not)
Take a star from the sky (take a star from the sky)
Why not (why not)
Spread your wings and fly
It might take a little
And it might take a lot
But why not
Why not

[Chorus:]
Why not (take a crazy chance)
Take a crazy chance
Why not (do a crazy dance)
Do a crazy dance
If you lose the moment
You might lose a lot
So... why not
Why not
