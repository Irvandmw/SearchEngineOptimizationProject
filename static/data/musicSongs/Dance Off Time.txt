Lyrics:


(Oh oh oh-oh oh ohhh)
(Oh oh ohhh)
(Oh oh oh-oh oh ohhh)

Well me plus you
Is greater than or equal to
The sum of every love we knew
Back when we were young

And if we multiply
I hope to God they get your eyes
And we get something that you can't divide
'Cuz baby you are the one

And we could dance off time
To songs I make up for you
'Cuz every word I write
Chord I strike is for you
Oh, oh it's for you
(Oh oh ohhh)
(Oh oh oh-oh oh ohhh)

Your sun-kissed skin
My souvenir of where we've been
You make me feel born again
Hallelujah, amen

And when the angel's sing
(Feels like heaven pouring down)
When the church bells ring
(Having my queen is crowned)
Well I could be your king
Just like when we were young

And we could dance off time
To songs I make up for you
'Cuz every word I write
Chord I strike is for you
Oh, oh it's for you
(Oh oh ohhh)
(Oh oh oh-oh oh ohhh)

All my life I've been runnin' wild
Too young to settle, foot on the pedal
Always chasing the perfect high
'Till you unlocked, yeah you unlocked
This heart of mine

We can dance off time
To songs I make up for you
'Cuz every word I write
Chord I strike is for you
One, two, three, four!
(Oh oh ohhh)
(Oh oh oh-oh oh ohhh)

And we can dance off time
To songs I make up for you
'Cuz every word I write
Chord I strike is for you
Oh, oh it's for you
(Oh oh ohhh)
(Oh oh oh-oh oh ohhh)
