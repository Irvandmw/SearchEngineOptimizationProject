Lyrics:


You take a K and an E
N and a T, a U and a C, K, Y
And that spells Kentucky
And it means paradise

You take a chicken and you kill it
And you put it in the skillet
And you fry it up a golden brown
And that's southern cookin'
And that's mighty nice

It don't cover a lot when you look on a map
But I once studied Geography when sittin' in my mammy's lap

You take a K and an E
N and a T, a U and a C, K, Y
And that spells Kentucky
And it means paradise

It don't cover a lot when you look on a map
But I once studied Geography when sittin' in my mammy's lap

You take a K and an E
N and a T, a U and a C, K, Y
And that spells Kentucky
And it means paradise

It don't cover a lot when you look on a map
But I once studied Geography when sittin' in my mammy's lap

You take a K and an E
N and a T, a U and a C, K, Y
And that spells Kentucky
And it means paradise

I said Kentucky
And it means paradise
