Lyrics:


Imagine a place you can always escape to
An island off the coast of nowhere
A new destination of your own creation
Just waiting till you choose to go there

Blue tree tops and velvet skies
You're ready to blow your mind
Oooo
This is a place where your mind can escape
All the problems today and go far, far away
This is a time with no history
Welcome to mystery

Imagine a city where everything's pretty
And you sir, you rule the kingdom
You call the shots you can do what you want to
Oh just imagine the freedom

Blue tree tops and velvet skies
You're ready to blow your mind
Oooo
This is a place where your mind can escape
All the problems today and go far, far away
This is a time with no history
Welcome to mystery

Blue tree tops and velvet skies
You're ready to blow your mind
Oooo

Imagine a room where the flowers they bloom
Through the cracks in the floor and the ceiling
Just you and the missus and rose scented kisses
My what a wonderful feeling

Oooo
This is a place where your mind can escape
All the problems today and go far, far away
This is a time with no history
Welcome to mystery

This is a place where your mind can escape
All the problems today and go far, far away
This is a time with no history
Feel no misery
Come and visit me
Welcome to mystery
