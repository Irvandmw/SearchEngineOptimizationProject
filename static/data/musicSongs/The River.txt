Lyrics:


Follow me down to the river, hey 
Follow me out of the woods
Follow me in, to wash away my sins 
The view up hereâs no good

Follow me down to the river, hey 
To follow me hereâs no good
Iâm goinâ in, where the water lives 
Couldnât stop me if you could

Follow me down to the river, hey 
To follow me hereâs no good
Iâm goinâ in, where the water lives 
Couldnât stop me if you could

Take me down, to the river
Where the waterâs clean, and the blood runs red 
Take me down, to the river
Wash me in the water, take me to the bottom

Take me down, to the river
Where the waterâs clean, and the blood runs red 
Take me down, to the river
Wash me in the water, take me to the bottom

Follow me down to the river, hey 
Take a drink, itâs good
Heaven knows, where the water flows 
The view from hereâs no good

Follow me down to the river, hey 
Take a drink, itâs good
Heaven knows, where the water flows 
The view from hereâs no good

Follow me down to the river bed 
Into the open waves
Come and cleanse at the waterâs edge
And wash the stains away

Follow me down to the river bed 
Into the open waves
Come and cleanse at the waterâs edge
And wash the stains away

Take me down, to the river
Where the waterâs clean, and the blood runs red 
Take me down, to the river
Wash me in the water, take me to the bottom

Take me down, to the river
Where the waterâs clean, and the blood runs red 
Take me down, to the river
Wash me in the water, take me to the bottom
