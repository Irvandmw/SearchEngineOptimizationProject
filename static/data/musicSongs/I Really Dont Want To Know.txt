Lyrics:


How many arms have held you 
and hated to let you go? 
How many, how many I wonder? 
But I really don't wanna know... 

How many lips have kissed you 
and set your soul aglow? 
How many, how many I wonder? 
But I really don't wanna know (Want to know!) 

So always make me wonder 
always make me guess 

And even if I ask you 
darling don't confess... 

Just let it remain your secret 
but darling I love you so...  
No wonder, no wonder I wonder, 
Though I really don't wanna to know... 

Though I really don't wanna to know...
