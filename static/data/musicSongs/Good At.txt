(MCV, bitch...)
(Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, and fuck you!)

Aye, aye, posing, drinking all the bottles of Patron and
Drive these niggas crazy cause they know they can't control me
A hottie, a model body, super Armani, I'm shining
If you looking, ain't that hard to find me
Yeah, Stalli is a player
I make these niggas toes curl like my baby hair
I get up on the drink and get to feeling on myself
Bad bitches singing all my songs like a prayer

I'ma super bad bitch and I only hang around with other bad bitches
Everywhere I go, I gotta take a damn pic
Turn around, look back, I get ratchet
Taking selfies, really trying to fix my lipstick
I love myself but niggas say I'm hard to deal with
I'm still hotter than them hoes that you chill with
And I could pull any nigga on some chill shit
And that's some real shit
I ain't choose being player, being player chose me (Hey!)
And no I ain't committed but I'm never lonely (Hey!)
I gotta keep these motherfucking haters off me (Hey!)
Don't be acting fly when you know you goofy (Hey!)

Tell me where it's good at
Tell me where the fly niggas in the hood at
Aye, fuck the club where the kickback
Aye, is that the 'yac lemme get that
Aye, somebody tell me where the boss be
Can you keep those broke motherfuckers off me
And I only keep the baddest bitches 'round me
Drop a yellow, redbone, and a bunny where it's sunny (Hey!)

Gucci on my coochie, glitter on my body
Everybody wanna do me
A hood Mona Lisa, figure like somebody drew it
If I introduced you to this pussy, nigga you gon' chew it
Rub your waves while I do it
I know bitches I've influenced, I look different they congruent
Post a pic up on the 'gram, then my DMs get to boomin'
They be âBaby, what you doing? Can I fly you out to Europe? Do your pussy taste like gum 'cause I'm really trying to chew it?â
Hit 'em back like, âWho you bank with? Do you got a lady and if you do can you still deposit my money safely?â
He watching all my videos just to watch me shake it
Never thought the nigga had a seizure, why he shaking?
Lemme wrap my legs around you keep you warmer than a blanket
Drive around the world, city to city, let you spank it
Posing for your picture cause I know you wanna take it
Tell the world you're mine, put it in them bitches faces
Tell the world you're mine, put it in them bitches faces
Tell the world you're mine, put it in them bitches faces

Tell me where it's good at
Tell me where the fly niggas in the hood at
Aye, fuck the club where the kickback
Aye, is that the 'yac lemme get that
Aye, somebody tell me where the boss be
Can you keep those broke motherfuckers off me
And I only keep the baddest bitches 'round me
Drop a yellow, redbone, and a bunny where it's sunny (Hey!)

Voguing, party with my bitches 'til the morning
Working every angle cause they love to catch me posing
A slick ponytail with a tight outfit
But why cover up with a body this sick?
And why you like to Facetime when I'm this lit?
I think it turn you on when I'm talking my shit
I ain't talking rapping when I say I like to hear you spit
You ain't talking sauce when you say you like to see it drip
I will never bust it open for no broke dick
I don't hang with bitches I ain't getting money with
Middle finger out the window when they lane switch
I know I'm handling my business when they talk shit
And my ex nigga always trying to take it there
He used to play me now he told me I ain't playing fair
Oh, so you want me now that you know I don't want you here
You just be calling me to say shit I don't wanna hear (Aha)
You just be calling me to say shit I don't wanna hear (Aha)
You just be calling me to say shit I don't wanna hear

Tell me where it's good at
Tell me where the fly niggas in the hood at
Aye, fuck the club where the kickback
Aye, is that the 'yac lemme get that
Aye, somebody tell me where the boss be
Can you keep those broke motherfuckers off me
And I only keep the baddest bitches 'round me
Drop a yellow, redbone, and a bunny where it's sunny (Aha, aha)

Aye, aye, I ain't choose being player, being player chose me
Aye, don't be acting fly when you know you goofy
