Lyrics:


Long live the king, you a king, you know it
King already, already, you know it
Top everything, everything, you know it
King already, already, you know it
Mind, body, soul, got a king body
Body gon' shine, bling bling, body
Calling all the shots, ring ring, body
Crown on your head, got a king body

Long live the king, you a king, you know it
King already, my baby, you know it
Top everything, everything, you know it
King already, already, you know it
Shine already, it's time already
The line already, it's time already
Shine already, it's time already
The line already, it's time already

Try to stop it, me say no, no, no
Royalty say, don't you know, know, know
Try to stop it, me say go, go, go, go
Bubble up and watch it grow, grow, grow, grow

Every king be ruler, be ruler, yeah
Everybody all dey conquer, yeah
Every king be stronger, yeah
King to rule them longer, yeah
Remember who you are, ooh
Real king always win, oh
Give up your bread, oh
I'll show your people my love
It's time already, I say it's time already
The line already, I say, line already
Only you got the remedy, I say you got the remedy
Shine your body, shine your body

Long live the king, you a king, you know it
King already, already, you know it
Top everything, everything, you know it
King already, already, you know it
Mind, body, soul, got a king body
Body gon' shine, bling bling, body
Calling all the shots, ring ring, body
Crown on your head, got a king body

Long live the king, you a king, you know it
King already, my baby, you know it
Top everything, everything, you know it
King already, already, you know it
Shine already, it's time already (Already)
The line already, it's time already (Already)
Shine already, it's time already (Already)
The line already, it's time already (Already)
Shine already, it's time already (Already)
The line already, it's time already (Already)
Shine already, it's time already (Already)
The line already, it's time already

Try to stop it, me say no, no, no
Royalty say, don't you know, know, know
Try to stop it, me say go, go, go, go
Bubble up and watch it grow, grow, grow, grow

Diamonds on my fist, fighting demons, oh
Come and rest your head, take your crown off, oh
Woke up in a foreign, need to take it slow, oh
He said I'm moving too fast, need to take it slow, oh
Take it slow, oh
Take it slow, oh
Tryna take my baby home
Take it slow, oh

Remember who you are, ooh
Real king always win, oh
Give up your bread, oh
I'll show your people my love
It's time already, I say it's time already
The line already, I say, line already
Only you got the remedy, I say you got the remedy
Shine your body, shine your body (Ah)

Be your own king
Make nobody come rule your world (Yo, yo, yo, yo)
Be your own king
Make nobody come rule your world (Ah)
Be your own king
Make nobody come rule your world (Yo, yo, yo, yo)
Be your own king
Make nobody come rule your world
Long live the king, you a king, you know it
Top everything, everything, you know it
Show them the way, you know it
You know it, you know it
