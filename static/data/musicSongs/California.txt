Lyrics:


I'm goin' home to California
And I'll be there in about a week
And I've been gone too long to worry
Can't you see I'm in a hurry
California, here I come

I've got some people in California
I hope they'll be there when I get home
But I've been gone too long to worry
Can't you see I'm in a hurry
California, here I come

Gonna live in a canyon made of gold
And there the sunshine shines everyday I'm told
And I've been gone too long to worry
Can't you see I'm in a hurry
California, here I come

I'm goin' home to California
And I'll be there in about a week
And I've been gone too long to worry
Can't you see I'm in a hurry
California, here I come
