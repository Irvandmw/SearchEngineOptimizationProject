Lyrics:


If you told me that you love me
I would feel so proud
If you'd let me hold you honey
I'd holler out loud
I'll never love another even if I can
Oh, come to me baby, I'm a one woman man

[Chorus:]
Won't you let me, baby
Just a kind of hang around
I'll always love you honey
And I'll never let you down
I'll never love another
Even if I can
Well, come to me baby
I'm a one woman man

I'd climb the highest mountain
If it reached up to the sky
To prove that I love you
I'd jump off and fly
I'd even swim the ocean
From shore to shore
To prove that I love you
A little bit more

[Repeat Chorus]

If you told me that you love me
I would feel so proud
If you'd let me hold you honey
I'd holler out loud
I'll never love another even if I can
Oh, come to me baby, I'm a one woman man

[Repeat Chorus]

Come to me baby
I'm a one woman man
