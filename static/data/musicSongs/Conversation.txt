Lyrics:


Conversation, gettin' so hard to make
I try to communicate, but i can't get through
We are strangers, but I remember when
You used to be my friend and my lover too

And I don't really know how it happened
And I don't really know what to say
I just wonder how we ever got this way

Conversation, that's what it's all about
Why can't we talk it out, say what's on our minds
Situations keep gettin' in the way
So much we need to say, but we're running out of time

And I don't really know how it happened
I have tried but I don't understand
How we ever let it get so out of hand

Just like a dream you can't remember
Even though you always wish you could
When it's gone, it's gone forever
When it's gone, it's gone for good

Conversation, things that we've done and said
Keep running through my head like a sad echo
Desperation is gettin' the best of me
Can't seem to make you see that I can't let go

And I don't really know how it happened
And I don't really know what to say
But I can't bring myself to throw it all away
