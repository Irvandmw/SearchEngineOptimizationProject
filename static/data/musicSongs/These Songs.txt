Lyrics:


Everybody's had a heartbreak
And everybody's been hurt
We need a shoulder just to cry on
Maybe a little bit more
Sometimes you need yourself a ballad
A sample with a nice beat
Cause see, I know what you're going through
It's all happened to me

And you're not alone
I hope this melody gives you hope
Oh, that's why I sing
That's why I sing these songs

Yeah, you know what you feelin'
But you can't put it in words
And all your friends tryna help you
But they're just making it worse
Yeah, I'm cheering what I know now
And this is dedicated to the lonely
I think I know what I'm talking 'bout
I'm only speaking from the old me

And you're not alone
I hope this melody gives you hope
Oh, that's why I sing
That's why I sing these songs

And you're not alone
I hope this melody gives you hope
Oh, that's why I sing
These songs to you
Don't you know all the love is looking for you
And that's why I sing
Oh, that's why I sing these song
Oh, no no no no no, babe
[?]
That's why I sing these songs
