Lyrics:


Just walked through the door
Selfish to the core
Here's the other side of me
Telling easy lies
Making women cry
Here's the other side of me

I'm in love again
Wreck the world again
I'm so happy to be free
Weak as water though
Is the place I go
On the other side of me

So I sit very still
And I'm laughing
As I feel my free will take
A thrashing

So I sit very still
And I'm laughing
As I feel my free will
Take a thrashing

Just walked through the door
Selfish to the core
Here's the other side of me
Telling easy lies
Making women cry
Here's the other side of me

I'm in love again
Wreck the world again
I'm so happy to be free
Weak as water though
Is the place I go
I'm in love again
So wreck the world again
Just walk through the door
Selfish to the core

So I sit very still
And I'm laughing
As I feel my free will
Take a thrashing
