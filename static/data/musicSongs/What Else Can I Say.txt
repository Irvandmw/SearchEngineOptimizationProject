Lyrics:


Where are you taking me?
I can't follow you there
What do you have in mind?
You know that I don't care

Where do you think I'm at?
Thought I made it clear
Please don't follow me back down
While I'm standing here

Early in the morning
Waiting for me to rise
The light of the new day dawning
Catches the sun in your eyes

Tonight,tonight, tonight
I'm standing here
And it's clear
I miss her
Tonight, she's so far away
What else can I say?
Because I know that she will never let me down
And I know she's gonna love me too

Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm standing here
And it's clear
I need her
Tonight, she's so far away
What else can I say?
Because I know that she will never let me down
And I know that she is gonna love me too

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
