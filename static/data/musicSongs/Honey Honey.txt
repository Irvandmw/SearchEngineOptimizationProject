Lyrics:


Honey, honey, honey
Don't wanna pretend that you've got money, money, money
And try and be my man
I hate the stupid girls who only want the world
Honey, honey I don't want your money, money, money

Money, money, ma ma ma money
Honey, honey ha ha ha honey

Baby, look in my eyes
And know that I'm true, I'm true
Don't gotta impress nobody but you, but you
Did you really think that I would love you less?
But the thought of you got my mind in a mess
So put your lies, put your tries, and your money away

Honey, honey, honey
Don't wanna pretend that you've got money, money, money
And try and be my man
I hate the stupid girls, who only want the world
Honey, honey I don't want your money, money, money

Stop trying so hard to convince me (me, yeah)
That you are the one I already see (already see, woah)
Did you really think that I would judge you more?
Boy, you make my heart fall down to the floor
So put your lies, put your tries, and your words away

Honey, honey, honey
Don't wanna pretend that you've got money, money, money
And try and be my man
I hate the stupid girls who only want the world
Honey, honey I don't want your money, money, money

No, you know that I hate, the ones who act fake
Cause they think I like it
You say their wrong, been wrong for too long
And I can't take it
So baby change your ways
Today

Honey, honey, honey
Don't wanna pretend that you've got money, money, money
And try and be my man
I hate the stupid girls. who only want the world
Honey, honey I don't want your money, money, money

Honey, honey, honey
Don't wanna pretend that you've got money, money, money
And try and be my man
I hate the stupid girls. who only want the world
Honey, honey I don't want your money, money, money

Honey, honey, honey
Don't wanna pretend that you've got money, money, money
And try and be my man
I hate the stupid girls. who only want the world
Honey, honey I don't want your money, money, money
