Lyrics:


Here am I one sad and lonely guy,
one shadow of the man I used to be.

Now it's past, the love I thought would last;
you thought I had you chained,
and now you're free.

I know it's wrong but I'm still holding on,
still praying you will soon come back to me.

But then you go, you let your feelings show;
you said I gave you pain, and now I see.

But baby, as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together.

Baby, this is just your way of breaking my heart.

And it's easier to say goodbye,
making me fall, making me try, try to make
you stay as you turn away.

Now you're gone, this road I walk upon is just
another place where I can hide.

I'm still your man, there's proof of who I am;
except without your love I'm dead inside.

But baby, as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together.

Baby, this is just your way of breaking my heart.

And it's easier to say goodbye,
making me fall, watching me try, try to make
you stay as you turn away.
