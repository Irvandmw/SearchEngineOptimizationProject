Lyrics:


I woke at four this morning
I couldn't sleep another wink
I need to do something
I had too long to sit and thing

And I hope
Hope and pray
That the wages of sin
Aren't paid today. 

I've led an average life
I've told the truth and I have lied
But I need a few more years
To help build up the credit side

So I hope
Hope and pray
That the wages of sin
Aren't paid today. 

Yeah I hope
Hope and pray
That the wages of sin
Aren't paid today.
