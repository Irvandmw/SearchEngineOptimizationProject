Lyrics:


I go from okay, I'm okay to I'm not okay in point two
I go from cool in my new place to packing my suitcase like you
I said it over and over that I wouldn't do this
Go find someone new and just fuck my way through this
But no way or no way I'm okay when thinking about you

You were right when you said it
Keep my cards to my chest and I never let no one know me
I pushed you out
Now, I get that you needed
Just a little more love and to just see me wide open and breaking down

When no one's there to listen I will heal your pain
I know that I was less than but you know people change
So, tell me what's the difference if we still feel the same
It takes a little distance to make you see the way

Deleted your photos, I know what I thought it would do
And I know what you're thinking that's never something I would do
I wish I could lie but I'm so not a liar
Been trying and I try to pretend that I'm fine but I
Just end up lying, yeah, feeling more than I want to

You were right when you said it
Keep my cards to my chest and I never let no one know me
I pushed you out
Now, I get that you needed
Just a little more love and to just see me wide open and breaking down

When no one's there to listen I will heal your pain
I know that I was less than but you know people change
So, tell me what's the difference if we still feel the same
It takes a little distance to make you see the way
