Lyrics:


Well, I may go through this life never knowing who I am
Or why I'm here, or why I'm doing what I'm doing
I guess I'll just go with whatever my name is
And take for word everything I've learned from my father
And my father's father

And they were making it up, making it all up
What else can we do?
Yeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up
It's the only way to get through
'Cause life's so hard but life's alright
'Cause I'm here with you tonight
Making it up, making it all up

Some people think the world revolves around them
And their beautiful child
Some people like to pile things up around them
And surround themselves with a beautiful lie

Yeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up
What else can we do?
Yeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up
It's the only way to get through
'Cause life's so hard but life's alright
'Cause I'm here with you tonight
Making it up, making it all up

And there's more to this life
More than what you see
And it's true what they say
That life is but a dream
So row your boat gently
Gently down that stream
And keep dreaming your dream

And keep making it up, making it all up
What else can we do?
Yeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up
It's the only way to get through
'Cause life's so hard but life's alright
'Cause I'm here with you tonight
Making it up, making it all up
