Lyrics:


I get the sniffles when I'm with you
My nose drips down, it's a pretty ugly picture
[?] ain't the best but I'll take it
Listen to my chest, mama knows I can't fake it
No, I never felt like this before
Somebody call a doctor cause my throat is getting sore
Hmm, you're just a tissue for my issue
I love the way you feel when I'm with you

So I say, doctor, doctor, help me see
Is she really good for me?
Would she make it hard to breathe?
Or clear my chest completely?
When she holds me, I feel fine
But I'm too scared to call her mine
I'd love to love her all the time
But she kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
I said, she kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
She kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
She kinda feels like my sickness
I'd love to love her all the time
But she kinda feels like my sickness

Somebody go and call for help
This lover might be good but it may affect my health
Hmm, I ain't got time for no drugs
She give it to me straight, God is this really love, love?
She got me wrapped around her finger
Feeling [?] cause I know I'm gonna linger
And I'm a mess, it's true
But I can blame it all on you

So I say, doctor, doctor, help me see
Is she really good for me?
Would she make it hard to breathe?
Or clear my chest completely?
When she holds me, I feel fine
But I'm too scared to call her mine
I'd love to love her all the time
But she kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
I said, she kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
She kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
She kinda feels like my sickness
I'd love to love her all the time
But she kinda feels like my sickness

But she kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
I said, she kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
She kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
She kinda feels like my sickness
I'd love to love her all the time
But she kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
Said, she kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
She kinda feels like my sickness
Ey ey ey ey ey
She kinda feels like my sickness
I'd love to love her all the time
But she kinda feels like my sickness
My sickness, na na
I said, she kinda feels like my sickness
