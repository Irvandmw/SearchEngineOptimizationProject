Lyrics:


Train tracks, clapboard bar
Green grass, wheat field farm
Three-digit population sign
Pirate on the 50-yard line

White church, a water tower
Name on a shirt, a 40 hours
We're all just living
For quitting time
Take a turn
On the carnival ride

We're all born to be free
We're all born to be great
But we're all looking for
The Hollywood sign
And trying to find the interstate
We're all grown
From the same old roots
We're all kicking
In the same old boots
We're all stars and stripes
And Friday night lights
Living it up, falling in love
Tonight somewhere, some town
Swing a little, drink a little
Sun goes down
We're all saved by Jesus
And our mama's prayers
We're all a little lost and found
In some town somewhere
Some town somewhere

Summer job at a hardware store
Town square plaque about the Civil War
Hey, Mexico is miles from here
But the Texaco's got a lot of beer

We're all born to be free
We're all born to be great
But we're all looking for
The Hollywood sign
And trying to find the interstate
We're all grown
From the same old roots
We're all kicking
In the same old boots
We're all stars and stripes
And Friday night lights
Living it up, falling in love
Tonight somewhere, some town
Swing a little, drink a little
Sun goes down
We're all saved by Jesus
And our mama's prayers
We're all a little lost and found
In some town somewhere
Some town somewhere...
