Lyrics:


Just take it take it
I canât take it take
I know what you do
Flash me
The ways itâs done
Impolitely
Trying to find some alone time
No room to compromise

Just take it take it
I canât take it take it

Send your picture to a magazine
The page is not true
Photography
Is that what you always wanted to be
Iâd be worried for you
Sometimes
Gonna try
Run and hide
Get away from this
Iâll get by
In this life
This time

Take your best shot
And press me
Write a fictional story
For your fee
Try to get the world 
To believe
Shocking headline surprise

Just take it take it
I can't take it take it

Send your picture to a magazine
The page is not true
Photography
Is that what you always wanted to be
Iâd be sorry for you
Sometimes
Gonna try
Run and hide
Get away from this
Iâll get by
In this life
This time

You see me
I see you
Youâre over there
You see me
I see you

Send your picture to a magazine
The page is not true
Photography
Is that what you always wanted to be
Well Iâd be sorry for you
Sometimes
Gotta try to
Run and hide
Get away from shit
Sometimes
Gonna try
Run and hide
Get away from this
