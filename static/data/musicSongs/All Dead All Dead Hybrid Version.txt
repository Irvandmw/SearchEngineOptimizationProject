Lyrics:


Memories, memories
How long can you stay to haunt my days?
'Twas not for talk of loving
'Twas not for talk at all
So much ado about nothing
Would be her only call

So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through many a fleeted summer
Through every precious day

All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead

All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
Still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
I know my little friend's
All dead and gone

Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead and gone
All dead and gone
