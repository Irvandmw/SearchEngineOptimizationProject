Lyrics:


I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

Do you remember when you told me
I don't have to worry?
He's overseas, out on his tour
He'll be okay without me
You said you had nothing to hide
That you left him long ago
I shoulda known that was a lie

I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

Do you remember when you said
Do not tell anybody?
'Cause if you do I'll be the first
To put my hands around your throat
If you had nothing to hide
Why is no one supposed to know
I shoulda known that was a lie

I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

I warned myself (warned myself) that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, the reason why)
