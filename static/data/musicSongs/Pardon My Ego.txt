Lyrics:


400 hundred thousand for a one off
Hit the stage, I rage, and then I run off
It don't matter where we at
It's poppin' like a gun off
Bumpin' NWA on the one oh one, ah
400 hundred thousand for a one off
Hit the stage, I rage, and then I run off
It don't matter where we at
It's poppin' like a gun off
Bumpin' NWA on the one oh one, ah

Skinny niggy-giggy gettin' brain dead, uh
I don't give a fuck what the lames said, uh
Old girl wanna give the boy head
How about a little bitty self-love instead?
I can't fuck a hoe, I'd rather self-love instead
Can't save a ho, no S on my chest or gun to my head (Ah)
Get the bread (Ah), get the bread (Ah)
Count this fuckin' money boy, now get the bread
I ain't just tryna get a nut off
Bobby boy be quick to leave a bad bitch cut off
Like when you in the studio and the vocal get cut o-

400 hundred thousand for a one off
Hit the stage, I rage, and then I run off
It don't matter where we at
It's poppin' like a gun off
Bumpin' NWA on the one oh one, ah (Woo)
400 hundred thousand for a one off
Hit the stage, I rage, and then I run off
It don't matter where we at
It's poppin' like a gun off
Bumpin' NWA on the one oh one, ah, like ah
Get the bread (Ah), get the bread (Ah)
Count this fuckin' money boy, now get the bread

I'm feelin' like Kid Cudi, a little crazy
But tell me what genius ain't a little nutty
E'erbody be like that sometimes
You can hear it in me in some rhymes
I ain't bi-polar, Kanye made me wish I was
'Cause that level of genius, the meanest
Nobobdy fuckin' around with a flow
When I spit it you know it's the cleanest
Uh, all my haters can suck my penis
Went from five hundred a show, to sellin' out arenas
From SOBs in NYC
To smokin' trees at the mothafuckin' Garden
Pardon my ego, uh maybe it's the weed smoke
Maybe it's the beat though
If I draw it in the sand
Better not cross the line like a free throw (Uh)

400 hundred thousand for a one off
Hit the stage, I rage, and then I run off
It don't matter where we at
It's poppin' like a gun off
Bumpin' NWA on the one oh one, ah (Woo)
400 hundred thousand for a one off
Hit the stage, I rage, and then I run off
It don't matter where we at
It's poppin' like a gun off
Bumpin' NWA on the one oh one, ah, like ah
Get the bread (Ah), get the bread (Ah)
Count this fuckin' money boy, now get the bread
