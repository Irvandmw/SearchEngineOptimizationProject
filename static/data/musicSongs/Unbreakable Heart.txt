Lyrics:


Hijacked when you werenât looking
Behind your back people are talking
Using words that cut you down to size
You want to fight back
Itâs building inside you
Holding you up
Taking you hostage
Yeah, itâs worth fighting for

Theyâll try to take your pride
Try to take your soul
Theyâll try to take all the control
Theyâll look you in the eyes
Fill you full of lies
Believe me theyâre gonna try
So when youâre feeling crazy
And things fall apart
Listen to your head
Remember who you are

Youâre the one
Youâre the unbreakable heart
Youâre the one
Youâre the unbreakable heart
Youâre the one
Youâre the one

Hijacked when you werenât looking
Behind your back people are talking
Using words that cut you down to size
You want to fight back
Youâre out in the open
Youâre under attack
But your spiritâs not broken
You know itâs worth fighting for

Theyâll try to take your pride
Try to take your soul
Theyâll try to take all the control
Theyâll look you in the eyes
Fill you full of lies
Believe me theyâre gonna try
So when youâre feeling crazy
And things fall apart
Listen to your head
Remember who you are

Youâre the one
Youâre the unbreakable heart
Youâre the one
Youâre the unbreakable heart
Youâre the one
Youâre the one

Donât look them in the eyes
Believe me theyâre gonna try
To fill you up with lies

Theyâll try to take your pride
Try to take your soul
(Youâre the one, youâre the one)
Theyâll look you in the eyes
Fill you full of lies

Youâre the one
Youâre the unbreakable heart
Youâre the one
Youâre the unbreakable heart
Youâre the one
Youâre the one
