Lyrics:


I got the news just yesterday
Called an old friend, asked him how you'd been
He said the wedding made the frontpage
You were smiling bright
You were dressed in white, angel white
Standing there with Mr Right

But I still believe that there's a destiny
That this winding road is leading me to
Someone I'm meant to find forever with
I can whisper all my sweet dreams to
I just always thought it was you

I'm still out here trying to find my dreams
In these smokey bars it's hard to see the stars
I always thought that I'd come back for you
Prove I was good enough to finally find some luck, a little luck
Yeah, and shut your daddy up

And I still believe there's a destiny
That this winding road is leading me to
Someone I'm meant to find forever with
Who would never tear my dreams in two
I just always thought it was you
Yeah

I still believe that there's a destiny
That this winding road is leading me to
Someone I'm meant to find forever with
Who would never tear my dreams in two
But I guess that I'll find someone new
I just always thought it was you
Yeah, oh, yeah
I just always thought it was you
