Talk, talking to ya
See, baby, when I'm talk, talking to ya
Baby, when Iâm talk, talking to ya
Baby, when I'm talk, talking to ya
(Yeah, yeah, when you, ayy, when you, when you talk dirty back)

Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag, now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)
Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag, now, baby, Iâm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)
Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag (When you talk to me), now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)
Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag (When you talk to me), now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)

Said when you talk like that, put that shit to work
Make that kitty hurt, make that kitty squirt
Tell me what's my name, make that kitty yearn
Teach me how to jerk, make that kitty learn
Uh, wait, who's your mama? Who's your daddy, lil' babe?
He want a baddie, he want skinny with a fatty, um, waist
Tell me how much you just want my body on you, babe
Like the way you say it's yummy when Iâm grindinâ on your face
Grindin' on your, wait, grindinâ on your face
Like the way you say it's yummy when I'm grindin' on your
Gri-gri-grindinâ on your face, ayy, grindin' on your face
I like the way you say it's yummy when I'm grindin' on your face (When you talk dirty back)

Talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag, now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)
Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag, now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)
Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag (When you talk to me), now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)
Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag (When you talk to me), now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)

And I say hey, I don't know the way, I
Don't know just how to say what's been all in my head, I
Just wanna let you in 'cause I know you got good taste, and
I love the way you taste, boy, tell me what you think, I
I, I, I
And I know you want me, now you got me
Don't you play with it, get naughty
Call you daddy, you call me mami
You so crazy when you taunt me (Yeah)
And I say, yeah, talk like that
All up in my ear when he want that wax
Funny how the earrings are all intact
Can't even hear when I moan like that
Aw yeah, that's your fault
With a lil' serious tone in fact
Grab my hair with the eye contact
Phone sex good, that's why I phone back, uh
And you know that I pick up right when you call me
Got your voice in my head, it's making me horny
And I can't ever wake you up in the morning
You know once they there, they ain't gonna be lonely

Talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag, now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)
Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag, now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)
Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag (When you talk to me), now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty back)
Now, when you talk like that (When you talk to me), I be in my bag
I be in my bag (When you talk to me), now, baby, I'm all in my bag (When you talk dirty)

Will you talk to me?
You must have it in you, I just like the way you think
I'm open if you are, you know what it's gon' be
Whisper to my soul, boy, I just like the way you speak
Talk, talking to ya
See baby, when I'm talk, talking to ya
Baby, when I'm talk, talking to ya
Baby, when I'm talk, talking to ya
