Lyrics:


Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah

Said she did more than a little molly
Said she's got a man but she don't hold down
She don't wanna be alone tonight, wanted me to get her right
So baby we can dim the lights and have ourselves a party

Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah
Baby turn that ass around
Baby turn that ass around
Baby turn that ass around

Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah

There's nothing I could ever say to save you, I'mma bounce it, drive you crazy, speeding into you right now
Drunk fucking, like we're faded, all night and day, yeah, baby I'mma break your heart
She don't wanna be alone tonight, wanted me to get her right
So baby we can dim the lights and have ourselves a party

Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah
Baby turn that ass around
Baby turn that ass around
Baby turn that ass around
Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah
Baby turn that ass around
Baby turn that ass around
Baby turn that ass around
Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah
