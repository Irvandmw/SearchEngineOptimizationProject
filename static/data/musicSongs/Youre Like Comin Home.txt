Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Riding restless under a broken sky
A weary traveler something missing inside
Always looking, for a reason to turn around
Desperate for a little peace of mind
Just a little piece of what I left behind
Well I've found it now
You're like comin' home

You're like a Sunday morning
Pleasing my eyes
You're a midsummer's dream
Under a star soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin'
At the end of a long long road
You're like comin' home
You're like comin' home

Go ahead and let your hair fall down
This wanderlust, it's gone now
Here in your arms I'm safe from the world again
These are the days they can't be erased
Baby there isn't a better place
You're like heaven
You're like comin' home

You're like a Sunday morning
Pleasing my eyes
You're a midsummer's dream
Under a star soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin'
At the end of a long long road
You're like comin' home
You're like comin' home

You're that innocence
That serenity
That long lost part of me

[Repeat Chorus]
