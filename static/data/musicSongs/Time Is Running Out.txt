Lyrics:


Woah-o, woah-o, yeah, yeah
You say I'm looking really bad, you say I'm looking really sick
And I don't even care I never really did
So when push comes to shove and I slap you in the face
Just remember one thing...

[Chorus:]
When its time to fill the void my whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out
I refuse to surrender, I refuse to surrender

So when I'm out of control and I'm out of my mind
Just remember one thing, I think I'm just fine
So catch me when I fall, I won't remember anything at all
So catch me when I fall

[Chorus]

Woah-o, woah-o, yeah, yeah
Woah-o, woah-o, yeah, yeah

When its time to fill the void my whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out

When its time to fill the void my whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out
I refuse to surrender, I refuse to surrender

I refuse to surrender, I refuse to surrender
