Lyrics:


You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I'm not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, and it's not fair

You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
That's enough for sure that you fucking with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby

You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
I've been there
Oh, yeah
I've been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

My homie said I need to stop it
My mama said bitches be watching you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinking liquor when we celebrating
Calculating all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you acting sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your fortÃ©
You used to be

You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
