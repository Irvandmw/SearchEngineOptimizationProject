Lyrics:


Been on another level
Since you came
No more pain
You look into my eyes
You can't recognize my face
You're in my world now
You can stay
You can stay
But you belong to me
You belong to me

If it hurts to breathe
Open the window
Oh, your mind wants to leave
But you can't go
This is a happy house
We're happy here
In a happy house
Oh this is fun

Music got you lost
Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you aren't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
Baby it's okay and my niggas next door
They be working in the trap
So get naughty if you want
Just don't blame it on me
That you didn't call your home
So don't blame it on me girl
Cause you wanted to have fun

If it hurts to breathe
Open the window
Oh, your mind wants to leave
But you can't go

This is a happy house
We're happy here
In a happy house
Oh this is fun
Fun for me

Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 7

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Now watch us chase it
With a handful of pills
No chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Weed's nice cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
Got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I got her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute
We just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' living
And when we act a fool
It's probably cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal
Ain't no fucking phony
Big O know the deal
He the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat
Like he fucking told me
Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man
Be her fucking story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man
Get to know me
Ain't no offense though
I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
