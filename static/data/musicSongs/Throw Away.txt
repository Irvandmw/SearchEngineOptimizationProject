Nard & B!

It's gon' be OK OK oh it's gon' be OK
We are illegal we don't play but you gon' be OK (FBG)
I want no relations, no, I just want your facial 
I want no relations, I just want your facial 

Pour some alcohol and drank it, baby, go and taste it 
Pour some alcohol and drank it, baby, go and taste it, OK
I want no relations, I just want your facial
Girl, you know you like a pistol, you a throw away

We gon' drank, girl, we gon' drink like it's Cinco De Mayo (and smoke!)
I won't ever tell you anything your heart desires
It's gon' be OK OK girl it's gon' be OK (wild wild)

I don't want no confrontation it's too complicated
Pour my lean for every baby you a hottie thottie
I'm 'a fuck you in Atlanta like we on an island

I can't lose my concentration girl I can't go on no dates (I can't go)
If we have a conversation gotta fuck today
I ain't disrespectful never, I ain't disrespectful
Got a black girl and a white one call em salt and pepper
I copped one of em a Beamer and one a Kompressor (skrr)
I told her I would call her back and I forgot to text her
(Free Bandz!)

It's gon' be OK OK oh it's gon' be OK
We are illegal we don't play but you gon' be OK (FBG)
I want no relations, no, I just want your facial 
I want no relations, I just want your facial 

Pour some alcohol and drank it, baby, go and taste it 
Pour some alcohol and drank it, baby, go and taste it, OK
I want no relations, I just want your facial
Girl, you know you like a pistol, you a throw away

DJ Esco Moe City, the coolest DJ on the motherfucking planet

Deep down, I believe you know you're a monster too
Gon' fuck that nigga get it over with 
Gon' fuck that nigga get it over with 
Gon' fuck that nigga get it over with 
Gon' fuck that nigga get it over with 
Future Hendrix

I know your true feelings ain't...
They couldn't be here you hear me?
They gotta be somewhere else

But I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to you
My love don't mean that much to you
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope when you fucking on that nigga when you finished, he can say that he love you

Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left

Mark my words I'm 'a ball without you
I came home last night to a mÃ©nage
Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you

When you're fucking on that nigga hope you're thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga are you thinking about me
'Cause I'm thinking about you
Gon' fuck that nigga get it over with
Gon' fuck that nigga get it over with

I want you to fuck with me paradise
'Cause I wanna be in your head tonight
If loving me in public ain't safe
You can take my love and hide it
Don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love

I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You going out the country
You posting up on IG

I'm laid up with my side piece
The one that text while you was right there laying up beside me
Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that your pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me your moving on, you don't love me no more
Monster

But I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to you
My love don't mean that much to you
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope when you fucking on that nigga when you finished, he can say that he love you

Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left
Mark my words I'm 'a ball without you
I came home last night to a mÃ©nage
Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you

When you're fucking on that nigga hope you're thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga are you thinking about me
'Cause I'm thinking about you

Gone fuck that nigga get it over with
Gone fuck that nigga get it over with
