Aye girl

[Hook:]
Aye girl
It's obvious you fine
I just want to know what's deep inside your mind
Maybe we can play girl
I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand
But I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin
If I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
I can give you my number you can give me what ever we'll have a hell of a time

[Verse 1: Logic]
What up baby girl won't you come here
I put it on my life I seen you some where
Where you stay at I'll come there ha
Ain't no stalking shit
I just want to talk and shit
Maybe grab a bite then after walk a bit
I just want to converse
Come on baby ain't no need to disperse
Shorty got that type of beauty that inspire this verse
So what's up
I'd be lyin if I said I didn't want a cup but it's deeper then that getting knee deep in the cat
I'm looking for that ride or die type of women it's what ever
I can be your king you can be my correta
Ain't no better
Get you wetter
Fuck em all
Think outside the box baby girl you know I ball
Yes you know I want it all
So make that shit a double
This is Young Sinatra and I'm rising from the rubble
People never say what's on there mind I'm like fuck a muzzle
Cause I got the feeling your the missing piece to my puzzle

[Hook:]
Aye girl
It's obvious you fine
I just want to know what's deep inside your mind
Maybe we can play girl
I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand
But I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin
If I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
I can give you my number you can give me what ever we'll have a hell of a time

[Verse 2: Logic]
What ever she wants I let her pick it like a fence from the suburbs everything coach but her plane ticket yea heard
We real all the time that's my word
Catch me in the cut tryna book her like a nerd
She a red bone bobby soxer
I had to stop her ha
Shorty a dime so you know I'm tryna cop her
Pop a bottle at our table periodically
Now check the science of that last line do it logically
No stopin me
I bet she would've never guest I never
Graduated
Cause the way I put my words together she infatuated
Mama I don't want know drama and I'm serious
Pause like a coma for I end it like a period now
Girl don't treat me like your ex man
I'm a beast on the track but if I am your next man
I'm a treat you tender
Take it slow like one video render
I remember
When I seen you for the first time
It was special like when I wrote my first rhyme
So if all I do is grind and never sleep
Then how in the hell is me and the girl of my dreams supposed to meet

[Hook:]
Aye girl
It's obvious you fine
I just want to know what's deep inside your mind
Maybe we can play girl
I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand
But I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin
If I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
I can give you my number you can give me what ever we'll have a hell of a time
