Lyrics:


Love was in the air
I am standing here
At the place you left me
Now there is no trace
The beauty of your face
Is just a memory

Gonna fake, gonna shake, gonna break forever
And if you do not change your mind, oh
Gonna lie, gonna dry, gonna cry on what you said
Gonna watch to the purple sky and dream away

Even when the sun is shining
Even when the dark is hiding
Even when the world is smiling
Don't know what to do without your love
I don't wanna hear what they say
I am gonna cry my own way
I know what I'm doing but I
I don't know what to do without your love

Underneath the snow
Still the river flows
Heading for the sea
Underneath my skin
There's a little wind
That blows for you and me

Gonna fake, gonna shake, gonna break forever
And if you do not change your mind, oh
Gonna lie, gonna dry, gonna cry on what you said
Gonna watch to the purple sky and fly away

Even when the sun is shining
Even when the dark is hiding
Even when the world is smiling
Don't know what to do without your love
I don't wanna hear what they say
I am gonna cry my own way
I know what I'm doing but I
I don't know what to do without your love

(I don't know what to do without your love
Without your love)

Even when the sun is shining
Even when the dark is hiding
Even when the world is smiling
Don't know what to do without your love
I don't wanna hear what they say
I am gonna cry my own way
I know what I'm doing but I
I don't know what to do without your love
