[Johnny Cash:]
Yesterday when I came home I was just about read to scream
My workâs been driving me crazy and the bills are burying me
The weight of the world was on me, I was sinking like a stone
But I have come to realize I canât do it on my own

[Johnny and Carter Family:]
Iâm going to put it into Godâs hands, start living on Godâs plans
Going to do the best I can, thatâs all I can do
Iâm going to put away my doubts, somehow itâll all work out
And I can rest easy now that Iâve put it into Godâs hands

[Johnny:]
My momma always told me you canât live by bread alone
You got to have faith in the good Lordâs grace and keep on keeping on
Accept the things that you canât change and change the things you can
And if you ever catch yourself worrying just put it into Godâs hands

[Johnny and Carter Family:]
Iâm going to put it into Godâs hands, start living on Godâs plans
Going to do the best I can, thatâs all I can do
Going to put away my doubts, somehow itâll all work out
And I can rest easy now that Iâve put it into Godâs hands
Iâm going to put it into Godâs hands, start living on Godâs plans
Going to do the best I can, thatâs all I can do
Iâm going to put away my doubts, somehow itâll all work out
And I can rest easy now that Iâve put it into Godâs hands
Going to put it into Godâs hands, start living on Godâs plans
Going to do the best I can, thatâs all I can do
Going to put away my doubts, somehow itâll all work out
And I can rest easy now that Iâve put it into Godâs hands
