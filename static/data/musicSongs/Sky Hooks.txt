Lyrics:


[Verse 1:]
Alrite, this the type a shit they be playin at the barbershop
I hear these mafuckas saying that it's all for naught
But I ain't stopping till I make it to the top y'all
They bout to feel stupid talking like a dropped call

Cause I'm bout to pop off ma dude, the flow too cashy
And this white dude ain't trashy
I'm actually college educated, U of R abbreviated,
Got inebriated but ma GPA was still amazing

On that 3.93 tip, fuck you know about a
Eastside G spittin uncontrollable
I mean if clever is the measure, then I'm better than
Whatever rapper's getting cheddar, I'm the king, and they corretta

They some bitches like a kennel got,
Dicky spittin devil hot
Listenin to ma writtens gotchu whistlin like a kettle potttt
I can't stop till I make a dent
But this is greatness, take it in
Ya namsayin cause

[Chorus:]
Ya'll mafuckas wanna be that kid
Wanna lease that wip
Wanna be that sick

Das a mafucka in this mafucka getting dough
Like a mafucka in this mafucka whatchu know bout a
Late teen with dreams, debate team to frees
To makin these hooks like Kareem, yamean
Now ya man deep in the game, but keepin the same
Cause I believe, I been keepin the faith, y'nawmsayin?

[Verse 2:]
And I spit that shit so asinine
Been known to jerk ma dick just to pass the time
And I ain't never really care for these fake mafuckas
Take mafuckas cake like I wait on these mafuckas

Hate when these mafuckas talk the talk
I'm at the plate, but you know I'm getting walked or balked or somethin'.

And you ain't even in ma league lil shawty
I'm a beast you can find me on the beach with a sporty lil young thang
Tan lines out the ass, so bad she about to go to Alcatraz
I gotta second with the tenth, thinkin alphabet
Lil dicky only breaking bad bitches, Malcolm's dad

I'm on the beat, know you hearda dat
G that'll murder cats
Freak raps, ma dude, ma genes in a fertile sack
Balls full a ballplayas, Archie Manning
I could even let a few in ya family

Now I'm laughin cause

[Chorus:]
Ya'll mafuckas wanna be that kid
Wanna lease that wip
Wanna be that sick

Das a mafucka in this mafucka getting dough
Like a mafucka in this mafucka whatchu know bout a
Late teen with dreams, debate team to frees
To makin these hooks like Kareem, yamean
Now ya man deep in the game, but keepin the same
Cause I believe, I been keepin the faith, y'nawmsayin?

[Verse 3:]
And I'm a cake like it ain't nothin.
I stay humpin with a cock, tryna date something.

I'm straight frontin cause I'm not, hard top on ma mamma lexus
I ain't stoppin til lil dicky and Obama texting
Dog, I just wanna rap till ya man straight blow up
I'm nasty, throw up
Ma fam reads torah

And I can do this shit on the reg ya dig
White mack sound brown like texases
I'm really dreamin bout the 22s but I can do it tho
I got a jewish flow and I ain't ever had a student loan

I think you knew it ho, darling, ya man correct
I tell y'all bout ballin, Stan Verret
Cause I been known to use a metaphor
Only fuckin ten or mores
Thought I was an artist but I think I'm likin metta more

Atlanta, Japan to Amsterdam
Ya boy bout to run up into the stands, ynamsayin baby

[Chorus:]
Ya'll mafuckas wanna be that kid
Wanna lease that wip
Wanna be that sick

Das a mafucka in this mafucka getting dough
Like a mafucka in this mafucka fuck you know bout a
Late teen with dreams, debate team to frees
To makin these hooks like Kareem, yamean
Now ya man deep in the game, but keepin the same
Cause I believe, I been keepin the faith, y'nawmsayin?
