Lyrics:


Me and you naked, baby
I wanna taste it
I won't ever say shit
You're not my favorite
I swear, I can picture us naked
I swear, I swear, I wanna taste it only if I say I care
Then I care, I don't just say shit
Baby, let's get naked
You ain't gotta worry 'bout shit
Just be my ride or die bitch
Yea, yea, nah, nah (girl)
You the type I'm fine with
Yea, just hold it down, do not switch
(Down down hold it down down)
My ride or die bitch

It's DTB no I don't trust bitches
And, I don't mean no disrespect, 'cause you know I love women
And girl, I know we got problems, but I hate discussin' 'em
If I fuck with ya, girl then I fuck with ya
This time, this time, I wanna make love to ya
Don't you switch sides, baby, I ain't done with you
Just help me get by, get by these trust issues
I swear, I swear, I feel uncomfortable
Crazy used to call you my baby, now I'm a dub to you
Used to pull up on you with flowers, showed you my love for you
You know, we both from the bottom, so I ain't judgin' you
Yea, I ain't judgin' you
But, I'm the reason you are this way
You used to fuck a lot you don't even fuck the same
And who you puttin' on that makeup and lingerie for
It's something that I wanna say
Baby, if you give it to me, I'mma give to you
'Cause I know what you want, yea
You wanna be a, up in my double R the one with the stars in the sky, yea, we in Louis Vuitton
Just hold it down for me, you my ride or die bitch
I take care of everything and pay the bills for you
And don't you ever fucking ask me 'bout no side bitch
And everything you say I do for you, I will for you
I'll be the reason why it's Hermes in your closet
Usually I don't be checkin' but I will for ya
Just tell me something I don't know, baby I'm nauseous
Look I been buggin' lately, I been feelin' heartless, huh
You think I changed, nigga?
I'm still the same nigga
I still will catch a stain, nigga
Still walkin' through puddles full of pain, nigga
I'm A Boogie Wit A Hoodie and a chain nigga
Wit' a guitar now, nigga, I'm a lane switcher
And a good car now, literally a lane switcher
Take off your leotard now, girl let's get naked
How you swerve, how you swerve?
Me and you naked
How you swerve, how you swerve?
I wanna taste it, I never say I care
And I care, I don't just say shit?
I stare, get nervous in conversations
With you, caught me stutterin' when I say shit like "Can I take you on - on a vacation?"
I will spin the block, 'cause you're my baby
I will hate to lose my love for an acquaintance
My ride or die bitch
Just hold it down, no matter what do not switch
Yea, yea, nah, nah, girl
You the type I vibe with
Ride for me never doubt shit
My ride or die bitch
