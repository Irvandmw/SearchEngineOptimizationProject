(Let that boy breathe)

Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), Don't stop (Aye)
Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), Don't stop (Aye)
Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), Don't stop (Aye)

You got a Rolex but can't tell the time 'cause you stupid as fuck (Let that boy breathe)
Don't fuck around, bitch I do what I love, yes I do what I want (Yes, I do what I want)
Hit up my homie T-Money, he supply the weed for the blunt
Hit up my homie T-Money, he supply the weed for the month (Aye)
I do it all, do what I want and I go where I want, but can't go to the mall (But can't go to the mall)
'Cause if I did, they'd shut that bitch down like, Rap Justin Bieber
Best believe, when I'm around, they go crazy, they go crazy, ride this dick girl, don't get lazy
Like "Oh!" That shit they love, right? (Aye, aye) POP, but keep that in the glove, right? (Aye, aye)
Michael Jackson on these hoes, you know I keep a glove (Hee-hee)
Boss up like Lando, like Donald Golve'
Yeah, my girl go commando, you know I love (You)
Light the scented candle, then you know I grub (Know I grub)
Can't fuck with no basic bitch who want a thug
Bobby sell albums, no he don't sell drugs (Let that boy breathe)

Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), Don't stop (Aye)
Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), Don't stop (Aye)
Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), Don't stop (Aye)

Logic hit my line, he said
I said "Say no more"
So gather 'round, but let me just say this before
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment y'all been waiting for
Gerald and Bobby, the clash of the titans, go tell somebody
The world has been waiting, the world has been watching, you finally got it
They always compare us, they pit us against us, yeah but that's not it
So, get the fuck off me, my brother he said he don't fuck with nobody
I'm feelin Godly, wearin' all white, rewritin' history, did it tonight
My OG told me we did it right, E-40 told me we did it right
Middle school dreams, stay coming true, we doing well (We doing well)
Walk in bodegas, buying my cover of XXL (XXL)
Fell in love with music, but I know this shit's a business now
Back to basics, like it's Lasic, got the vision now
Been had drive, but I swear this shit's just different now
2 Ferraris later, everything is clicking now (Let that boy breathe)

Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), Don't stop (Aye)
Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), Don't stop (Aye)
Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), Don't stop (Aye)
Make it pop (Aye), Make it pop (Aye)
Make it drop (Aye), (Let that boy breathe)

(Hee-Hee)
