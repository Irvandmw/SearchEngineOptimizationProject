Lyrics:


[LunchMoney Lewis & Meghan Trainor:]
I love me, hey
I love me, hey
I don't know about you, but baby I love me
Now everybody say, hey-hey-hey
Oh, hey-hey-hey, I love me
Hey-hey-hey, I love me

[Meghan Trainor:]
They gon' say all kinds of things
They'll make jokes about my name
They gon' try to clip my wings, but I'm gon fly, I'm gon' fly
They'll try to play me like a game
I'll bet they're too scared of the fame
But I can see clear when I'm looking in the mirror, saying God made me just right

[LunchMoney Lewis & Meghan Trainor:]
I love me, I love me
I don't know about you, but baby I love me
Now everybody say, hey-hey-hey
Oh, hey-hey-hey, I love me
Hey-hey-hey, I love me

Because I'm sexy and it ain't my fault
I ain't waiting on nobody's call
You don't want me baby, that's your loss (your loss)
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
And you can tell by the way I talk (You hear me?)
And you can tell by the way I walk (two stepping baby)
I can see clear when I'm looking in the mirror, saying God made me just right

I love me, I love me
I don't know about you, but baby I love me
Now everybody say, hey-hey-hey
Oh, hey-hey-hey, I love me
Hey-hey-hey, I love me

I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
I love all y'all, but I love me the most
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
I love all y'all, but I love me the most
Go and raise your glass, give yourself a toast
I love all y'all, but I love me the most
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
I love all y'all, but I love me

I love me (I love me) I love me (I love me)
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But baby I love me (Baby I love me)
Now everybody sing, hey-hey-hey
I love me hey-hey-hey, I love me
Hey-hey-hey

Do you love you? I love me
Me too
