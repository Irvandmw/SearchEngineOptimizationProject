Lyrics:


Operation failure to launch

Operation failure to launch
Good vibrations, take what you want
Patiently wait where you are
I'm coming, I'm running to you for eternity
Doctor, fix me upâ I need awakened
Her eyes are closed, my dreams are vacant
Plans we made, they must go on
I'm here for it, I won't be long

My operation love
You hold me down, she picks me up
Don't make me drown
Into the clouds I'll find my home
When I'm with her I'm not alone

Occupation love, ohh uhh ohh uhh uh oh
(Oh!)
Occupation love, ohh uhh uh, ohh uhh uh oh

Standing ovation, pledge to this nation
Dream of creation, what are we waiting for?
(Yeah) Time wasting
Reality with a few modifications, God behind Satan
I musta, musta saw faces
Hell's gonna come before it changes (we)
Obligated to tolerate the evil
Planet over-populated by the people but I see you
When you're disguised, you be keepin' it live
But I got you where I want you, I be deep in your mind
(Yeah)
Love is among us and I'm seeing the signs
You too strong to move on and leave me behind (yeah)
I love you, girlâ you know that
I found peace inside you and I don't wanna go back

My operation love
You hold me down, she picks me up
Don't make me drown
Into the clouds I'll find my home
When I'm with her I'm not alone

Occupation love, ohh uhh, ohh uhh uh oh
(Oh!)
Occupation love, ohh uhh, ohh uhh uh oh
