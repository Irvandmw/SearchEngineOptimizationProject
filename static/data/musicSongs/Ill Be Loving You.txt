Lyrics:


[Johnny Cash:] When your friends donât call you like you thought they would
When you canât get over me like you thought you could
When you canât forget me the way you planned to do, remember
[June Carter:] Iâll be loving you

[Johnny:] On a cold and lonely morning
[Both:] Iâll be loving you
[Johnny:] On a dark and lonely evening
[Both:] Iâll be loving you

[Johnny:] One happy day youâll be back
[Both:] Cause you know that we ainât through
Iâll roll you in my arms again
Iâll be loving you

[Johnny:] When your memory of me is a heavy load
When you feel youâre traveling down a muddy road
When the new love that youâre craving donât do like he ought to do, remember
[Both:] Iâll be loving you

[Johnny:] On a cold and lonely morning
[Both:] Iâll be loving you
[Johnny:] On a dark and lonely evening
[Both:] Iâll be loving you

[Johnny:] One happy day youâll be back
[Both:] Cause you know that we ainât through
Iâll roll you in my arms again Iâll be loving you
