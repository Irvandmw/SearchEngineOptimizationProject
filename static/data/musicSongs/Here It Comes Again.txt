Lyrics:


Here he comes again 
on the radio, another misogynist 
calling her a bitch, calling her a whore
and then he'll use a big word,
use a big word some of the time
just to make it rhyme
just to make it rhyme.

Here it comes again
got to keep it real, another hymn to violence
suffocating joy, draining all ideals
another hymn to violence,
give me silence some of the time
just to make it rhyme
just to make it rhyme.

So words are thrown to waste,
and women are debased for fun
and as they start to sing
I can't help wondering
what we've become?

Oh, here it comes again,
on my new TV, another well-fed schoolboy
saying he's a man, but what kind of man,
puts down women, puts down women
all the time
just to make it rhyme,
just to make it rhyme?

Here it comes again, [x4]
on the radio,
calling her a bitch, [x2]
calling her a whore. [x3]

Here it comes again, [x4]
on the radio,
calling her a bitch, [x2]
calling her a whore. [x3]

Here it comes again. [x10]
radio/radios. [x16]
Here it comes again. [x2]
