Lyrics:


Yeah, hey, yeah

There is no reason you should feel like this
I know that I am the only one to blame
I feel your agony, itâs hidden in your kiss
Ooh

I donât believe that things are said and done
I only hope thereâs still time to be the one
We could work it out if only you let me
Ooh

Whatever you say, whatever you do
There will be good times waiting for you
Whatever you hear, I wonât disappear
I promise you that
I promise you that

I never said that I could change the world
But if you gave me the chance that I deserve
I know that in your heart
You can forgive me
Ooh

Whatever you say, whatever you do
There will be good times waiting for you
Whatever you hear, I wonât disappear
I promise you that
I promise you that

We had times only a fool could miss
Still there is time to turn it around
Iâm not saying itâs an easy thing
Let me show you
I promise you that
Ooh, yeah

Whatever, whenever
There will be good times waiting
(There will be good times)
Whatever you hear (Whatever you hear)
I wonât disappear

Whatever you say, whatever you do
There will be good times waiting for you
(There will be good times)
Whatever you hear, I wonât disappear (Ooh)
Whatever you say (Whatever)
Whatever you do (Whenever)
There will be good times
(There will be good times waiting for you)
There will be good times (Whatever you hear)
I wonât disappear
I promise you that
I promise you that

Whatever you hear, I wonât disappear
I promise you that
I promise you that
