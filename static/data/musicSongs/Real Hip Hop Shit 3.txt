Lyrics:


Leather jacket, relaxing
The movie scenes Iâm acting
These rappers practice
Iâm at the plate, enough to bat bitch
Fully smoking locomotive, nigga, fuck an adlib
In the club celebrating cause Iâm self promoted
Is it a fire? Cause the crowd smoking!
Big Will, she off a pill.. rollin
You know a country nigga hungry
Waffle house? Open!
But they too broke to pay their bills
So theyâre freeloading
But itâs cool, sit down
You know that nigga rich?
Girl his name.. Chris Brown
His chainâs so ugly that it makes a bitch frown
Iâm serving all these niggas
But who ordered hash browns?
Nigga, I be like.. yeah I got the check
And I just paid your bills, so.. yes
I want some sex
Hah! But first, can I kiss your neck?
And Iâmma work you out
So you ainât gotta stretch
Hold up! Let me slow up
Impregnate your beat, I make that bitch blow up
I eat all I can eat
Until a nigga throw up
I tell that DJ âay! Pull up, pull upâ
Man, Iâm so sick of these lame motherfuckas
A niggaâs still shitting on the game, motherfucka
Old niggas as the world change, muthafuckas
Yâall niggas still being the same muthafucka?
Who else, dawg?
Look, let me go in, then I count more ends
My tints 11, and your friends in my Benz
The engine on that Viper 220
And itâs green in the trunk, but thatâs new money
Watch.. Frank Mueller, my Ruger
Cut that shit â fire. I just shot my jeweler!
Another hundred racks just to make my chain a cooler
Off that Four Loco, out of my medulla
Wow! I be seeing dead people
Dead prezzies my besties
Nigga, we are not equal
How you get the big picture
Looking from a peephole?
My real niggas in the back, but
âHe ainât talking to me tho!â
I know you mad cause I afford it
TMZ, Iâm wiping my ass, so stop recording
Supposedly a singer, canât do hip-hop
But I just killed this shit, so let the
Shit rock
