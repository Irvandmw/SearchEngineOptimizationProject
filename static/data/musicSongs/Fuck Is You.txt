Lyrics:


Bitch it's Wallah fuckin Dan, who the fuck is you
You ain't my motherfuckin man, who the fuck is you
Brought the cannon to the jam, who the fuck is you
Who the fuck is you, nigga who the fuck is you
Don't give a fuck what you sayin, who the fuck is you
We don't know you better scram, who the fuck is you
Scum gang my only friend, who the fuck is you
Who the fuck is you, nigga who the fuck is you

Tekashi69 from that scum squad, Yall niggas don't want no drama
First nigga act touch get on Worldstar, and I put that on my momma

Can't be where I'm at I don't know you
Bet my little niggas run up on you
Theyll leave a nigga flat no warning
Scum gang bitch we on and fuck nigga you don't want it
You can try 69 if you wanna die
All my niggas down for the homicide
Theyll be on a shirt, you be in the church
Dressed up in a box with ya momma cryin
She kissing your corpse, I don't know who you is and you pissing me off
I aim at your heart bullets, rip through your cross
Rip through your heart, stitches can't fix it it's straight to the morgue
Better hope you don't slip and get lost in these parts
Walk through the park after dark catch a spark
Scum is the gang, Praise to allah

Bitch it's Wallah fuckin Dan, who the fuck is you
You ain't my motherfuckin man, who the fuck is you
Brought the cannon to the jam, who the fuck is you
Who the fuck is you, nigga who the fuck is you
Don't give a fuck what you sayin, who the fuck is you
We don't know you better scram, who the fuck is you
Scum gang my only friend, who the fuck is you
Who the fuck is you, nigga who the fuck is you
