Song Name: It Turns Me On
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


She throws her Braves cap on her head, every time it rains
And when her favorite song comes on, she sings out of key as it plays
Always leavin' the car on empty, and blamin' me for what she did

But when we talk about our future, or the name of our first kid

It's kinda crazy but turns me on, how shes always blowin' up my phone
It's not some cover girl on a magazine, it's the one I fell in love with at 17
An addictive drug that pulled me in, not them long tan legs or her perfect tint
It's the imperfections that she wants gone, it's kinda crazy but turns me on

I love to give her silent treatment, when she throws her little fits
Thinkin' shes gonna get her way, as she pokes out her bottom lip
When she makes her funny faces, and does her best British accent
Or when she says that shes not hungry, and then I get mine and she digs in

It's kinda crazy but turns me on, how shes always blowin' up my phone
It's not some cover girl on a magazine, it's the one I fell in love with at 17
An addictive drug that pulled me in, not them long tan legs or her perfect tint
It's the imperfections that she wants gone, it's kinda crazy but turns me on

It turns me on

An addictive drug that pulls me in, not them long tan legs or her perfect tint
It's the imperfections that she wants gone, it's kinda crazy but turns me on

Yeah, yeaaah. Oh it turns me on
Yeah it turns me on
