Lyrics:


There was a girl I knew.
She was more than beautiful.
She had a mind of her own.
5 foot 8 or more.
(Something like that.)
She was a real wild child,
And nothing could hold her back
She was my sis' best friend.
So, now you know where it's at.

Oh, yeah.

She's always been around.
Me and her were always down.
Right in front of me.
How could I be so blind to see?
She was always hangin' out.
Me and her we talked about
Everything I never knew.

She told me,

"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
That's what she told me.
"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
She told me.

She told me.
She told me.

It was one of those times way back in the day.
She was at my door with a smile across her face.
(Chicky.)
I said, "My sister ain't home. She's gone out for a while."
She said, "That's cool with me. That's the reason I came by."

Oh, yeah.

She's always been around.
Me and her were always down.
Right in front of me.
How could I be to blind to see?
She was always hangin' out.
Me and her we talked about
Everything I never knew.

She told me (yeah),

"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
That's what she told me.
"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
She told me.

She told me.
She told me.

Sing "Na, na, na, na, na".
â Na, na, na, na.
Sing, "Na, na, na, na, na".
â Na, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, na, na
â Na, na, na, na
Sing it with me "Na, na, na, na, na".
â Na, na, na, na.

"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
That's what she told me
"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
She told me

"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
She told me
That's what she told me
"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
She told me

"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
That's what she told me
"If you like my style, come on!
If you need a ride, come on!
Compatible star sign, come on!"
She told me
