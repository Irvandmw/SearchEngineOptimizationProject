Lyrics:


[in {} are lyrics from another version]

You act like you don't know me {You Think you're going nowhere}
When you see me on the street {When you're walking down the street}
Yo're makin' like I turn you off {Acting like you just don't care}
When I know you think I'm sweet {When life could be so sweet}

It don't have to be like that {Why you wanna be like that}
I guess you're insecure {As if there's nothing new}
If you say what's on your mind {You're not fooling no one}
I might answer "Sure" {You're not even fooling you}

So I walk a little slower {So walk a little slower}
And I try to catch your eye {And open up your eyes}
Sometimes it's so hard to see {Sometimes it's so hard to see}
The good things passing by {The good things passing by}

There may never be a sign
No flashing neon light
Telling you to make your move
Or when the time is right

[Chorus:]
(So) Why not
Take a crazy chance
Why not
Do a crazy dance
If you lose a moment
You might lose a lot
So... why not
Why not

Why not take a crazy chance [X2]

You always dress in yellow
When you want to dress in gold
Instead of listening to your heart
You do just what you're told

You keep waiting where you are
For what you'll never know
Let's just get in to your car
And go, baby go

[Chorus]

Oh... oh
I could be the one for you
Oh... yeah
Maybe yes
Maybe no
Oh... oh
It could be the thing to do
What I'm saying is
You gotta let me know

You'll never get to heaven or even to L.A.
If you don't believe there's a way

Why not
Take a star from the sky
Why not
Spread your wings and fly
It might take a little
And it might take a lot
But... why not
Why not

[Chorus]
