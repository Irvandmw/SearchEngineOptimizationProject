Lyrics:


[Future:]
I bet she love
I bet she love, love
I bet she

[Young Thug:]
It's true I said I love you but I didn't promise
We came from grippin' the K's, our fingers got bunions
Keep adding on keys to my door
And we made love

All this fake love got me damaged
I can't take it, I just popped another xanny
I'm fuckin' on your bitch when I land in the states from another planet
Fly as a bitch when I make mistakes and I don't plan it, yeah

[Young Thug (Future):]
Yeah, I bet she loves me (I bet she loves me)
I bet she loves me (I bet she loves me, I bet she loves me)

[Young Thug:]
Show me the love to my friends bitch
I dropped the top out the Benz
Been rockin' since creme de la creme, yeah
I know we never go in
I tat the footprint of my kids, ayy
Life of recess
Starvin' to the ceilings
Can't forget, my big brother called me home from a bid, yeah
Turbo nine eleven coupe for the ridge
Turbo nine eleven coupe for the ridge
I fucked her friend, I would never tell her
I feed the swoop peanut butter jelly
Up a hundred mil, let my nigga tell it
Up a hundred mil
I done cracked the seal, let these haters tell it
But I cracked the seal
I can get 'em killed, yeah Kill Bill
And I got diamonds from my toes up to my ears
Yeah I got an implant inside, took off the goodyears
Yeah I got red diamond on the eye ring, not tears
Got the shirt off in the Rolls Royce, yeah
Put a hole on the killtech, 'cause I ain't tryna get killed yet, umm

[Future:]
I bet she love
I bet she love, love
I bet she love me

[Young Thug:]
All this fake love got me damaged
I can't take it, I just popped another xanny
I'm fuckin' on your bitch when I land in the states from another planet
Fly as a bitch when I make mistakes and I don't plan it, yeah

[Future:]
I don't give a fuck about big homie, I'm big homie 'round here
I'm rockin' blue diamonds, ain't nothin' to get ya killed
You gonna get scarred, you don't get eternal life (I bet, yeah)
Ballin out for X before I rolled dice, (I bet, yeah)
The agent just called and said the Hawks was available, I'm ready
You're all about the hawk nigga, that G5 is calling you (it's callin' you)
It's pink way more than I ever imagined (imagined)
I done measured it so I'm higher than Aladin (leggo)
No swaps out, I'm undecided whenever I pop out
I had the swerve for four years, I'm still under forty thousand miles
Bought the Bentley coupe and a bedspread on the same day
She drove the GTF, fell in love with it the same day
She told me it was her favorite car, she dreamed about it
I couldn't walk away, my ego all in the way
I dropped cash on it, she told me she loved me even more (Freebandz)
These photos and quaaludes, they got me dehydrated
Turn on me, sue me, now nothing seems to amaze me
I left on a commercial flight and downgraded
If I can change anything I wouldn't erase it (I wouldn't erase it)
Came back on a private plane and upgraded (I made it)
It had to be destiny, it had to be the recipe
It had to be the formula, I'm not normal
I told you (I told you)
If you woulda took the flesh out me (took the flesh out me)
You woulda ran off with it and tried to convince me it was karma
(I bet she love)

All this fake love got me damaged
I can't take it, I just popped another xanny
I'm fuckin' on your bitch when I land in the states from another planet
Fly as a bitch when I make mistakes and I don't plan it, yeah

[Future:]
I bet she love, love
I bet she love, love
I bet she
I bet she love
