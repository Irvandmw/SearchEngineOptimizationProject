Lyrics:


Fear in your eyes like you're looking for a window
For the wide open skies wondering where do I begin though?
If you knew how bright you shine
Do you think it might change your mind?
The clouds are on fire, and they're telling you something that they know

You shine like gold
You shine like gold

Remember what you said when you drove all night from Memphis?
That the headlights of your eyes were running from the tempest
When the dawn broke through the black
We were laughing looking back
No matter how dark, the morning comes up relentless

You shine like gold
You shine like gold
And your soul was born to shine
Like a spark
In the night
And the dark can't hide your glow

When the thoughts in your mind are like thieves
And they take you places where
Love is hard to believe
And the air gets thin and lungs
Find it harder to breathe

Remember what you know

You shine like gold
You shine like gold

You shine like gold
You shine like gold
And your soul was born to shine
Like a spark
In the night
And the dark can't hide your glow
