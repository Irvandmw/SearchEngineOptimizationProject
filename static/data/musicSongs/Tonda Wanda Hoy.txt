It's easier to say I love you than tonda wanda hoy comma kalai
And wouldn't you rather say I love you than tonda wanda hoy comma kalai

To quote a famous Yale professor
Osculation is a sensation that is nice (so nice)
If you should ask a Harvard lawyer
He'll charge you twenty dollars and he'll give you this advice

It's easier to say I love you than tonda wanda hoy comma kalai
And wouldn't you rather say I love you than tonda wanda comma kalai
