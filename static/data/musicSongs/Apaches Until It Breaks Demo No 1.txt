Lyrics:


It goes a one, two, three...

I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when a competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I put 'em both together, now tell me what I got,
It's a pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it
Like that

It ain't over
'Cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in, nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothin' to lose
Now you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady, little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I'd be laying on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that
