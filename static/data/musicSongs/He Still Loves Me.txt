Lyrics:


Took me a while
But I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify
Make it crystal clear
(take your time)

See I've been picked out to be picked on
(oh lord)
Talked about outta my friends mouth
I've been beat down
(pray)
'Til He turned my life around
(turn my life around)

Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me

I ain't no superstar
The spotlight ain't shining on me
(no no no no no)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me love me

I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
(Why can't she get up)
'Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me

Everybody's got opinions
(they share)
They ain't been in my position
(they don't care)
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me yeah
(what they say about you)

Seems like I always fall short (falling short)
Of being worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
'Cause I ain't good enough (no no)
But he still love me (still love me)

I ain't no superstar
(I ain't no superstar)
The spotlight ain't shining on me
(I wanna be for you)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me

I'm not perfect
(I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong
(yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best
(trying my best but)
But it ain't good enough
(just ain't good enough)

Shunned by the world
(shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me
(I just ain't good enough)
But You love

If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved

Stand for Him or fall for anything
'Cause through His eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain

Feels like we always fall short of being worthy
(we are not worthy)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me

I ain't no superstar
(I ain't no superstar)
The spotlight ain't shining on me
(but I wanna be for you Lord)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But You still love me

I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best but
(trying my best)
It ain't good enough
(I'm not good enough)

Shunned be the world
(shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
(I don't succeed-ceed-ceed)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me
(child sing with me)

I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
(if you understand the same)
I'm trying my best but
It ain't good enough
(But the Lord's been so good to me)
Shunned be the world
(Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
'Cause I ain't good enough
(I ain't good enough)
But He still love me
(The Lord still loves me)

No I ain't good enough
But He still love me
(Raise your hands if ya understand)
No I ain't good enough
(How He blessed you 'cause he blessed you too)
But He still loves me
(even though I ain't worthy)
No I ain't good enough
(you ain't worthy, He's there for you)
But He still loves me
(no matter what I do)
No I ain't good enough
(I ain't good enough)
But He still love me
(but the Lord still loves me)
