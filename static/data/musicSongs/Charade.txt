Lyrics:


Some nights we made our love in the sand
And at the tide we held our love in our hands
And we listened to music the ocean was playing
The words that our two hearts were saying
That only two lovers can make
Let us ride on the wind while this moment is real

You're the light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blessed me forever

And believing I have been touched by your love
And the pleasure of knowing the evening won't tare us apart

We can follow the sun till the day light is gone
We can gaze up the sky till the night is over

Light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blessed me forever

We can follow the sun till the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over

Light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade

And this feeling knowing you blessed me forever
We can follow the sun till the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade...
