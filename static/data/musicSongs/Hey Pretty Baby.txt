Lyrics:


Hey pretty baby, I need your love
Underneath the stars and moon above
Oh let it be tonight, tonight, tonight

Hey pretty baby, just want you to know
You kinda like me 'cause I've been told
Come on and treat me right

Hey pretty baby, go steady with me
I'm ready honey can't you see
Well let's make it tonight

Kiss me baby like I know you can
One kiss'll make me understand
You and me together can't go wrong
So hold me baby, hold me all night long

Hey pretty baby, just want you to know
You kinda like me 'cause I've been told
Come on and treat me right, right tonight

Hey pretty baby, I need your love
Underneath the stars and moon above
Oh let it be tonight

Kiss me baby like I know you can
One kiss'll make me understand
You and me together can't go wrong
So hold me baby, hold me all night long

Hey pretty baby, just want you to know
You kinda like me 'cause I've been told
Come on and treat me right

Hey, hey hey hey hey hey, pretty girl
I need your love tonight
Need your love tonight
