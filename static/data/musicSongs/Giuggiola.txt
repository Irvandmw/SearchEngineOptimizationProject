Lyrics:


Her smile could charm the little fishes from the sea
I'm in her arms and all at once that silly chatter
Begins to sound like she was reading poetry
(Giuggiola, Giuggiola, Giuggiola)

They call the lady Giuggiola, Giuggiola, Giuggiola
And I'm in love with Giuggiola, Giuggiola
If she says day is night...

But every time she sighs
I want to dance

I want to dance with Giuggiola, Giuggiola, Giuggiola
I want to hold her close to me
Close to me, closer than my skin
'Til our two hearts are one heart

Giuggiola, Giuggiola
Can make my heart go cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
