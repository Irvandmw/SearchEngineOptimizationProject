Lyrics:


We're doing it.

I look around me
But all I seem to see
Is people going nowhere
Expecting sympathy.

It's like we're going through the motions
Of a scripted destiny.
Tell me where's our inspiration?
If life won't wait,
I guess it's up to me.

No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town.
And we won't come back. The world is calling out.
We'll leave the past in the past, gonna find the future.
If misery loves company, well, so long.
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.

Procrastination running circles in my head.
While you sit there contemplating,
You wound up left for dead (you're left for dead).
Life is what happens while you're busy making your excuses.
Another day, another casualty.
But that won't happen to me.

No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town.
And we won't come back. The world is calling out.
We'll leave the past in the past, gonna find the future.
If misery loves company, well, so long.
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
When I'm gone.
Let's go!

Won't look back
When I say goodbye.
I'm gonna leave this a hole behind me,
Gonna take what's mine tonight.
'Cause every wasted day becomes a wasted chance.
You're gonna wake up feeling sorry
'Cause life won't wait.
I guess it's up to you.

No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town.
And we won't come back. The world is calling out.
We'll leave the past in the past, gonna find the future.
If misery loves company, well, so long.
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
