Lyrics:


Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Into your arms
Said you fucked another man
Finally, I knew this day would come
Whoa oh oh
Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land you're mine

It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face
I've been living on the road
And you've been living all alone, at home
Girl I hope, he made you satisfied
Well baby I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land you're mine

And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there

There are certain things that I've come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, simple woman
I try to master the art, of that far away love
Only so much can keep a woman warm
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
We've been living in a cold, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know that when I land you're mine

And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
And he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there

Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
C'est tout ce qu'on entend
Les jours se dÃ©filent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
EmbobinÃ© dans ma toile, je les dÃ©voile Ã  nouveaux
10 ans mon ami, que ne rien d'autre compte
Elle n'Ã©tait qu'une gamine Ã  ce moment
Souffrant d'un cÅur brisÃ©, une douleur trÃ¨s profonde
C'est lÃ  oÃ¹ je l'ai aperÃ§ue, seule, prÃªte Ã  entamer ses 17 ans
