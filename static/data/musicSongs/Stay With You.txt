Lyrics:


We've been together for a while now
We're growing stronger everyday now
It feels so good and there is no doubt
I will stay with you

As each morning brings sunrise
And the flowers bloom in springtime
On my love you can rely
And I'll stay with you

Oh I will stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I will stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
And I know we'll be alright
I will stay with you

Though relationships can get old
They have the tendency to grow cold
We have something like a miracle
Yeah, and I'll stay with you

Oh I will stay with you through the ups and the downs
Yes I will stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
And I know we'll be alright
I will stay with you

And there'll be heartaches and pain,
Yes it will
But through it all, we will remain
In this life, we all know
Friends may come, and they may go
But through the years I know
I will stay I will stay
And in the end I know that we'll find
Love so beautiful and divine
And we'll be lovers for a lifetime
And I'll stay with you

Oh I will stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I will stay with you (Oh I'm gonna stay) when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
And I know we'll be alright
I will stay with you
Everything will be fine
And I will stay with you
Through the end of all time
I will stay with you
