Lyrics:


[Bryan:]
She only cried every other Tuesday night
She is a crying shame, she could had done something right
In this little town everybody knows her name
Now she's flown away the town will never be the same
Oh oh

[Mark/all:]
Her eulogy read that 
This is the home
Yeah yeah
Of Jessie James
A.K.A.

[Bryan/all:]
The crying girl (the crying girl)
The crying girl (the crying girl) 
She's the crying girl (the crying girl)
Little crying girl (the crying girl)

[Bryan:]
People in the street, crying cos she lost her life
All the spirits gone, finished up by the night
Ye-yeah
In this state of mind everybody makes mistakes
Yeah
But it's ignorance that let you have your life to take

[Mark/all:]
What nobody knows
She was my girl
Yes, I am the one
Who fell in love

[Bryan/all:]
With the crying girl (with the crying girl)
The crying girl (the crying girl)
She's the crying girl (with the crying girl)
Little crying girl (the crying girl)

[Bryan:]
Nobody knows her, nobody loves her now
[Mark:]
Nobody knows, nobody knows
[All:]
The crying girl

[Bryan:]
Nobody knows her, nobody loves her now
[Mark:]
Nobody knows, nobody knows
[All:]
The crying girl

[Bryan:]
Nobody knows her, nobody loves her now
[Mark:]
Nobody knows, nobody knows
[All:]
The crying girl
