Song Name: When November Falls
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


How did you arrive in the single moment
That I looked away
Your life waits for you
In every second
And every word you say
For all the memories remaining
I need to let you know

From the hardest times to the hills you climb
Iâll be your warmest summer
When your dreams run dry, I am on your
side
To pull you out from under
When all of your leaves are golden
Everyoneâs arms are open, but Iâll be there
When November falls

I am with you when I hear you breathing
And when Iâm far away
Surrender to your fears of falling
Cause I wonât let you go

[Chorus]

When your hopes have been gunned down
And when you get lost, I will find you
Iâll hear you calling out my name, oh

[Chorus]
