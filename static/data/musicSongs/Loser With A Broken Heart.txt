Lyrics:


Many miles of memories
Many tears I can't forget
But I know you live inside me yet
Oh
Many hours to contemplate
Many dreams I can't recall
Many nights I've felt I was too small
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yea
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yea
It's a hard and bitter world
When you face reality
And it's hard to be who you want to be
Oh
Many miles of memories
Catch the wind and blow away
But I know that it's over, over anyway
Oh
But tonight I sit and wonder why
You left me here
After all this time I don't know why
You left me here
If it's all behind me
You know you'll find me
Oh
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yea
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yea
But tonight I sit and wonder why
You left me here
After all this time I wonder why
Wonder why
You left me here
If it's all behind me
You know you'll find me
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yea
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yea
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
