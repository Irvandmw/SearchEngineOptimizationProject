Lyrics:


How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
Just to be where you are?
Can anyone tell me how far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, tell me how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
