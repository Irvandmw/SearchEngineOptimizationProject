Lyrics:


What do you want?
What do you want?
I'm givin' everything I have
I'm even trying to see if there's more
Locked deep inside
I'll try
I'll try
Can't you see this is me?

What do you need?
What do you need?
Is it someone just to hurt
So that you can appear to be smart?
And keep a steady job
Play God
Play God

What do you really know?
You parasite
You're dynamite
At oversight
Misunderstanding what you hear
Oh, you're quick to cheer
And volunteer
Absurdities, musical blasphemies
Oh Lord, save us all

What do you want?
What do you want?
I'm givin' everything I have
I'm even trying to see if there's more
Locked deep inside
I'll try
I'll try
Can't you see this is me?
