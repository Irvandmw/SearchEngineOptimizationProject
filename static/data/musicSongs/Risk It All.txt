Lyrics:


[Verse]
I could never fly, I was afraid to fall
I would never swim, too far away from shore
Never took the jump, without a safety net
Never played the hand, was unsure of it
Thought I was living, yeah
But I was existing, aye
And everything I got I tried so hard to find
For you I'd leave it behind

[Chorus]
If you had the world right now
If you had it all worked out
If you had it all to lose
Why would you take time to choose?
You already know by now
For me there are no doubts
Whether we rise, whether we fall
I take one look at you, and I feel
I feel like risking it all

[Verse]
If I asked you to run away with me right now
Take a look around,
What could you live without?
Tell me everything,
There's nothing more you need than to be here with me
I thought I was living
But you're what I was missing
I was head strong way too long
What was I thinking?
Now I dive heart first into love

[Chorus]
If you had the world right now
If you had it all worked out
If you had it all to lose
Why would you take time to choose?
You already know by now
For me there are no doubts
Whether we rise, whether we fall
I take one look at you, and I feel
I feel like risking it all

[Verse]
Could have my life the way you do
Iâd walk away from all I knew
Iâd turn my back and take the blame
Tell me that you would do the same (youâd do the same)

[Chorus]
If you had the world right now
If you had it all worked out
If you had it all to lose
Why would you take time to choose?
You already know by now
For me there are no doubts
Whether we rise, whether we fall
I take one look at you, and I feel
I feel like risking it all
