Lyrics:


I am Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live for the organ, that I am grinding
I'll die, but I won't go away

I am Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live for the organ, that I am grinding
I'll die, but I won't go away

Ooh, wait a minute, I think you better trip on this
Ooh, wait a minute, I think you better trip on this

I was on my way to another room
When an image of you sweetly
Appeared in the mirror
Perhaps you recall
You and I were neatly
In the middle of a Crystal Ball
That now serves as a reminder
On the wall of you and I the organ grinder
In the greatest concert of them all

I am Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live for the organ, that I am grinding
I'll die, but I won't go away

Did you know that I still have your stockings?
I keep 'em in a drawer next to your brassiere
Come hither, my sweet, lend me your attention
Come hither lend my your ear
I do believe that my piano was stolen
I do believe that you want me near
Well I can deal with a sucker
If he's in your mouth
But I can't deal with insincere
I'm the one that lives in your heart
You love me, no matter what you say
Swear you don't miss the organ grinder
Grinding on you every day

I am Violet the Organ Grinder (I am Violet the Organ Grinder)
And I grind all the live long day (and I grind all the live long day)
(Check this out)

Ooh, wait a minute, I think you better trip on this

I took all the pictures you gave me
And I placed them right under my bed
And I pumped and I pumped
'Til the 'gasm much as jumped
From my feet to the top of my head, oh boy!

I'm Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live for the organ, that I am grinding
I'll die, but I will not go away

Ooh, wait a minute, I think you better trip on this

Like a puppy, I licked your devotion
From your neck from your eyes from your ears
When you cry, I became your emotion
And if you ever cry like that again
I'll be here

'Cause I'm Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live for the organ, that I'm grinding
I'll die, but I won't go away

Not even...
(Peace to the mutha)
(Who turned the mother out)

I am Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live for the organ, that I am grinding
I'll die, but I won't go away
