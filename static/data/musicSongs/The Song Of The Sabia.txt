Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, that my place is there,
And there it will always be, there where I can hear the Song of the Sabia.
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, I will lie in the shadow of
A palm that's no longer there, and pick a flower that doesn't grow.
And maybe someone's love will speak the night.
The lonely unwanted light that may bring me through the new day.
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, they won't be in vain,
All the plans I made to deceive myself, all the rose I made just to lose myself,
All the love I made to forget myself, those mistakes I made just to find myself.
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, that my place is there,
And there it will always be, there where I can hear the Song of the Sabia.
Of the Sabia.
