[Chris Brown:]
My niggas, we fuck up some commas
Some of them dirty like shabba
Jamaican and Haitian, no matter, they pull up with choppers
All of my niggas got rounds, I spray a new face on you clowns
I got a bitch in the viddy, I gave her the shrimp and the lobster
I put that girl in Givenchy, Versace, I'm feeling like shabba
How that bitch so Hollywood, but that bitch living in Bompton
But I be training these hoes, fresh out the boat, yeah

[Hoody Baby:]
Shawty ride with a nigga through the west coast
Downtown pimp, I done left hoes
My life so good, I done blessed hoes
I might crowd surf for my next show
All of my niggas is trappers
We take the dope on the road
You see that I'm on the corner
We selling dope at the shows
You see the ice on my wrist
You see my neck full of gold
Boy, you at home with your girlfriend
I got a house full of hoes
Homie, I stay on the road

They wanna play in the snow
