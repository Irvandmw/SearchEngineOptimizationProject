Lyrics:


(The most beautiful sound I ever heard) 
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria... 
(All the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word) 
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria... 
Maria, Maria... 
Maria! 
I've just met a girl named Maria! 
And suddenly that name will never be the same to me... 
Maria! 
I've just kissed a girl named Maria! 
And suddenly I've found how wonderful a sound can be... 
Maria! 
Say it loud and there's music playin', 
Say it soft and it's almost like prayin', 
Maria! 
I'll never stop sayin' Maria! 
Maria! 
I've just kissed a girl named Maria! 
And suddenly I've found how wonderful a sound can be... 
Maria! 
Say it loud and there's music playin', 
Say it soft and it's almost like prayin', 
Maria! 
I'll never stop sayin' Maria! 
(The most beautiful sound I ever heard) 
Maria! 
(Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria...)
