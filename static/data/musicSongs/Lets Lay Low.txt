Lyrics:


Honey, put those keys away
We won't need 'em
Underneath these sheets we'll stay
We won't leave 'em

Through the open blinds, the sunshine's warming us, warming us
Devil's in your lips, each kiss is glorious

So let's lay low (Lay low)
We'll never get dressed, let your head rest on my pillow
Let's lay low (Lay low)
Whenever we chill, I feel so high, so let's lay low
Lets lay low
(Lay low)
(Lay low)

Hot as hell up in this room, sinking into ya
Feels like heaven here with you, hallelujah

We're so loud, the neighbors, they're all hating us, hating us
Jealous we've got boxsprings serenading us

So let's lay low (Lay low)
We'll never get dressed, let your head rest on my pillow
Let's lay low (Lay low)
Whenever we chill, I feel so high, so let's lay low
Lets lay low (Lay low)
(Lay low)

Through the open blinds, the sunshines warming us, warming us
Devil's in your lips, each kiss is glorious

So... let's lay low (Lay low)
We'll never get dressed, let your head rest on my pillow
Let's lay low (Lay low)
Whenever we chill, I feel so high, so let's lay low
Lets lay low (Lay low)
(Lay low)
(Lay low)
Lets lay low
(Lay low)
(Lay low)
Lets lay low
