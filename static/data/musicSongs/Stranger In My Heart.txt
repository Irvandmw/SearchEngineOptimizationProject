Lyrics:


Well life has been okay
Mostly every day
In a little corner of the world
But lately I've been sad and feeling blue
Since long ago I knew I should have told you

There's a stranger in my heart
Tearing us apart
Calling through the skies above
And it feels like love

My suitcase in the hall
Scares me on in on
And you are not the only one to cry
I am sorry now we didn't make it
This is no excuse but I can't take it

There's a stranger in my heart
Tearing us apart
Calling through the skies above
And it feels like love
There's a stranger in my heart
Telling me to leave
And I know the way to go
In love I must believe

Lately I've been sad and feeling blue
Since long ago I knew I should have told you

There's a stranger in my heart
Tearing us apart
Calling through the skies above
And it feels like love
There's a stranger in my heart
Telling me to leave
And I know the way to go
In love I must believe
