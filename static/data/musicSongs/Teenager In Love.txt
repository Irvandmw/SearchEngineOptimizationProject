Lyrics:


Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart.
Cuz I'm so afraid,
That we will have to part.
Each night I ask the stars up above,
Why must I be a teenager in love.
One day I feel so happy,
Next day I feel so sad.
I guess I'll learn to take,
The good with the bad.
Cuz each night I ask the stars up above,
Why must I be a teenager in love.
I cried a tear,
For nobody but you.
I'll be a lonely one if you,
Should say we're through.
Well if you want to make me cry,
That won't be so hard to do.
If you should say goodbye,
I'll still go on lovin you.
Each night I ask the stars up above,
Why must I be a teenager in love.
I cried a tear,
For nobody but you.
I'll be a lonely one if you,
Should say we're through.
Well if you want to make me cry,
It won't be so hard to do.
If you should say goodbye,
I'll still go on lovin you.
Each night I ask the stars up above,
(Why must I be a teenager in love.) [3x]
