Lyrics:


Something about the way you moved
That caught my eye
I really did have to try it, yes
I can't deny it
The way your body swayed
As I watched you from behind
That got me so excited
How could I fight it
Baby let me be the one to hold you
To give you the things I know you need
You know that we could wait another life time
And we can never find a love just like this

[Chorus:]
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can get all inside me
And I can get all inside you too
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can wake up beside me, forever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever, baby

Let's take this chance to get to know each other better
Baby we will discover that we can be more than lovers
I'll give you what you need
Just come to me and get it
Baby you won't regret it

No, no, no baby
Baby move a little closer, yeah
I wanna feel your body next to mine
And before this night is over
You will know what it means
To make love until you scream

[Chorus]

Tonight, (tonight) we'll find
Find just what what we've been looking for
Good, good lovin and a whole lot more
So hold on, hold on real tight
Hold me and don't you let go
Until I tell you to

[Chorus]
