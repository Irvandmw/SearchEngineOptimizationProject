Lyrics:


Every time I kiss somebody new, I
Make believe I'm kissing you but
I can't kid my aching heart 'cause
My heart know we're still apart and

Each night is like a thousand years
I can't lose these young boy blues

I wanna cry when I hear your name, but
If I cry, I feel ashamed, so
I let my pride be my guide and then
I keep those tears inside, so

Each night is like a thousand years
Since I lost these young boy blues

Don't know where to go
Don't know what to do
I'm so lonesome and lonely
Since I lost you

Every time I kiss somebody new, I
Make believe I'm kissing you but
I can't kid my aching heart 'cause
My heart know we're still apart and

Each night is like a thousand years
I can't lose these young boy blues
Each night is like a thousand years
I can't lose these young boy blues

Each night is like a thousand years
