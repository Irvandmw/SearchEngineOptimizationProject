Lyrics:


[Shane:]
Being interviewed by somebody
in a hotel lobby 
She says where do you come from
Now I'd really like to talk about it
but if you write it
please don't get it wrong

[Mark:]
Mum said you should always aim high
to a kid with a glint in his eye
She would never lie 

[Chorus:]
And now we're four years on
feels like we've just begun
never forget this is where we belong
Everytime that we talk about moving on it turns into a song
Cause together we're strong (oh we're strong)
like the place we come from
This is where we belong

[Nicky:]
Next question
I bet I've heard this one before
No we're not about to stop (no, no)

[Bryan:]
So let me ask you something
When we got something this good
tell me why would we give up

[Mark:]
Mum said you should always aim high
to a kid with a glint in his eyes
She would never lie (no, no) 

[Chorus:]
And now we're four years on (four years on)
feels like we've just begun (just begun)
Never forget this is where we belong (oh yeah)
Everytime that we talk about moving on it turns into a song
cause together we're strong (oh we're strong) like the place we come from this is where we belong

[Kian:]
Last question
Now I've really got to go
till the next time (next time) yeah yeah 

[Chorus:]
And now we're four years on (four years on)
feels like we've just begun (just begun)
never forget this is where we belong (yeah yeah)
Everytime that we talk about moving on it turns into a song
Cause together we're strong (yeah
yeah) like the place we come from (together we're strong)
This is where we belong 

And now we're four years on
feels like we've just begun
Never forget this is where we belong (never)
Everytime that we talk about moving on (talk about moving on) it turns into a song
Cause together we're strong
like the place we come from
This is where we belong
