Lyrics:


One for you and one for me
But one and one and one, pardon me
Comes to three
You're looking sweet and all the while
Hid behind the smile was saccharine
I'ma go between

Save me, save me
Baby, baby sugar me
Gotta get my candy free
Sugar me by day
Sugar me my baby
Baby sugar me
Gotta get my candy free
Sugar me by day
Sugar me by night
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar

Count me in from one to two
But nothing more or less will do
Just me and you
Honey sweet and harmony
Will melt away the bitter memory
It's got to be

Save me, save me
Baby, baby sugar me
I gotta get my candy free
Sugar me by day
Sugar me my baby
Baby sugar me
I gotta get my candy free
Sugar me by day
Sugar me by night
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar

Save me, save me
Baby, baby sugar me
I gotta get my candy free
Sugar me by day
Sugar me my baby
Baby sugar me
I gotta get my candy free
Sugar me by day
Sugar me my baby
Baby sugar me
I gotta get my candy free
Sugar me by day
Sugar me my baby
Baby sugar me
I gotta get my candy free
Sugar me by day
