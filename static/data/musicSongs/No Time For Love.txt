Lyrics:


Well I got my life together
Everything's right in place
So why do I feel like I'm losin' it
Every time I see your face

I got 24 hours in my day
I got seven days in my week
I got time for work, and time for play
And a little time left to sleep

But I got no time for love
No mind for love
I'm way too busy makin' plans
I got no time for love
Oh yeah

Well you walk right into my life
And try to win me with your kiss
But I got places to go, and things to do
And your kiss ain't on my list

I got no time for love
No mind to for love
I'm way too busy makin' plans
I got no time for love

Oh, no time for love
I got no mind for love
I'm way too busy makin' plans
I got no time for love
