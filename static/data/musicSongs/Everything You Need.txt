Lyrics:


You're sitting in the bedroom playing the guitar
Writing in a notebook your wish upon a star
You are like a snowflake melting in my hand
Vanish like a footstep sinking in the sand

You're living in a greenhouse playing with a stone
You wanna be a princess looking for a throne
You cry a litte teardrop when you had enough
But you don't wanna listen when I sing about love

Don't wait for better days
Reach out and take away
Everything you need
The world is at your feet
Inside you wanna stay
Don't try to run away
Hold me in the sun
The best is yet to come

Just around the corner there's a happy life
Dreaming of tomorrow when you could be a wife
You cry a little teardrop working with your hair
You're running away from everyone who cares

Don't wait for better days
Reach out and take away
Everything you need
The world is at your feet
Inside you wanna stay
Don't try to run away
Hold me in the sun
The best is yet to come

(Don't run away)
(Hold me in the sun)

Don't wait for better days
Reach out and take away
Everything you need
The world is at your feet
Inside you wanna stay
Don't try to run away
Hold me in the sun
The best is yet to come

(Don't run away)
(Hold me in the sun)
The best is yet to come
(Don't run away)
(Hold me in the sun)
(Don't run away)
