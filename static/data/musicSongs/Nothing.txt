Lyrics:


Nothing's ever gonna change
If you don't stand up and you don't say nothing
Waiting on better days
But they won't show up if you don't do nothing

Deep down it hurts that I can't do a thing
My eyes are bleeding, they're glued to the screen
Headlines are monsters that everyone honors
Blink if it hurts you to see what I see
Both eyes have witnessed this catastrophe
Stand at the altar, swear me a promise

Don't you surrender, no
There's no surrender

Nothing's ever gonna change
If you don't stand up and you don't say nothing
Waiting on better days
But they won't show up if you don't do nothing
You're not safe
Put a needle in your coffin counting all your losses
You're not safe
If you only gotta stand up, stand up

Face with the truth in the demons we see
Fist to the sky, tell me what you believe
Put down your weapons, put down your weapons
If you've been kicked down, get back to your feet
No turning back now, no there's no retreat
When they hear us running, they'll know we're coming

Don't you surrender, no
There's no surrender
Don't you surrender, no
There's no surrender

Nothing's ever gonna change
If you don't stand up and you don't say nothing
Waiting on better days
But they won't show up if you don't do nothing
You're not safe
Put a needle in your coffin counting all your losses
You're not safe
If you only gotta stand up, stand up

Stand up!
Go!
Stand up!
Stand up!
(You're not safe)
Stand up!
