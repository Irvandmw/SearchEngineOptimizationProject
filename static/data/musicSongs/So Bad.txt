Baby, I don't really cuff girls
But baby I'll cuff you
Because I really want you, yeah

You so bad baby tell me why don't you
Come my way all I want to do is see your face
We can take it slow this ain't no race
But we can speed up if that's okay
Yeah, If that's okay

Every time you walk by I just wanna put you on replay
See you walk by again
Baby you a ten
Can I be your man
And we can just chill
I don't gotta go in say
We could take it slow
Baby you already know it's the wintertime
Out early in the snow
So we can stay in it's cuffing season Imma stay in to till the end

You so bad, yeah
And baby I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah
And baby I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad
And baby I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah
And baby I want you so bad, yeah

Girl nothing lasts forever
But, baby I swear I can fuck you till' whenever
Usually I play, but I ain't playing whatsoever
However, we could do it how you want it
Girl they don't want to sever
But we could do it better swear
Imma keep tryin' I won't never let up
My last girl, she was so damn fed up
Yeah, I swear everyday she was telling me whatever
I'm tired of these hoes that want me so perfect
Girl you different, now
Swear you so damn perfect, yeah

You so bad, yeah
And baby I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah
And baby I want you so bad, yeah

And baby I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah
And baby I want you so bad, yeah

Now I got you where I wanna
Baby you so fine, can I have you till' the summer
If I had you we could do it where we wanna
When I get you Imma rope you in like vanilla
Too fucking bad baby a fashion killer
I saw you looking down, baby keep your chin up
I'm growing onto you, Now I got you baby hold up
Now you can tell them, all them niggas, say back up
Baby you mine Imma keep you till' the sun up, yeah
