Lyrics:


I have a true confession
To make to you alone
It's all about the way I love you
And adore you my own

I've tried to seek expression
For this desire I feel
You made a very deep impression
That my heart must reveal

Let me confess what I feel for you
The dreams that I dream
I'd even lie and I'd steal for you
Go to most any extreme moment, oh-oh

This is my true confession
I swept by stars above
And now you're in complete possession

Of my secret of love
