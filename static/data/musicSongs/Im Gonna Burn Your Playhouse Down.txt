Lyrics:


I've got an achin' in my heart
Arson on my mind
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down
I've got a badly broken heart
And I've had it from the start
You're giving me the run around
Well if you play with fire
It's sure to burn
Known this all of my life
Go on, be on your way, I've had my say
Well honey, I'm through with you for life
You'll find there's one in every yard
I'm getting mighty tired
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down
Well, don't pretend that this is the end
'Cause this time we're really through
While you were runnin' around
Burning up the town
Well, I set my trap for you
I've got an achin' in my heart
Arson on my mind
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down.
