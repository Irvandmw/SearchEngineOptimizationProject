Lyrics:


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Its 3 am, I canât sleep
Too late to call this is not like me
But Iâm still lifted from the tattoo on the small of your back
The angle of your chin when you were looking back

See, god youâre beautiful and Iâm still coming down
Iâd like a one-night stand, that had to stick around
But Iâm still floating on the perfume you left on my sheets
I havenât changed a thing since your goodbye to me

Tonight I stare out the windowâ¦
Knowing Iâll never again be alone

Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life
Last night you saved my life

Your fingernails running down my spine
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind
Itâs like I knew you all my life even though we just met
My children in your eyes, something you donât expect

I had to stop myself from calling all day long
Iâm glad you called me first, I wanted to be strong
But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring
I tried to play it off
But you knew everything

Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life with your love

Last night you saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life

Ohh yeah

I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun
Canât wait to tell you youâre the only one
Last night you saved my life

And I was stuck in the moment you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you changed my life
