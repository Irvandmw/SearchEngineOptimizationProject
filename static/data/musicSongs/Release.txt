Lyrics:


Twenty miles from anyone
Set my sights on the setting sun
Heaven talks but not to me
'Cause heaven knows that nothing good comes free
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me [4x]

I've let me down, down, down, down [2x]

Petty lies to everyone
In the hopes that I could be someone
Heaven talks but not to me
And now I wonder if it's meant to be
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me [4x]

I've let me down, down, down, down [4x]

I'll take your word
'Cause after all you've never lied
Oh not at all
But look at me
Oh what a mess
I get caught up in the things that matter the least
Oh let me have release

I've let me down, down, down, down [4x]
