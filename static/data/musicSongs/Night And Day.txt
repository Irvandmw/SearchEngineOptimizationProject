Lyrics:


Night And Day, You Are The One;
Only You Beneath The Moon, Under The Sun.
Whether Near To Me Or Far,
It's No Matter Darlin', Where You Are;
I Think Of You, Night And Day.

Night And Day, Why's It So,
That This Longing For You, Follows Wherever I Go.
In The Roaring Traffic's Boom;
In The Silence Of My Lonely Room;
I Think Of You, Night And Day.

Night And Day, Under The Hide Of Me,
There's An Old, Such A Hungry Yearning, Burning Inside Of Me;
And This Torment Won't Be Through,
Till You Let Me Spend My Life Making Love To You;
Day And Night, Night And Day
