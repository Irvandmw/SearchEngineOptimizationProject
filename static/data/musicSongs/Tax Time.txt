Lyrics:


I fuck ya bitch better when it's tax time
Tryna get up in them pants, 'cause I really need a bag, ion really mean to brag
I ain't seen a nigga yet, that can run in wit ya boy
I'm walkin' round the house without a shirt like uncle Roy
I sent my uncle Rick to get some liquor from the store
I need to hit the nursing home to see my uncle Ray
Supposed to go and see my momma but I went and made a play
I ain't nothing like the muhfuckin' niggas round the way, I'm the muhfuckin' truth
Everything I muhfuckin' do
I asked him what he paid the nigga said 25, should've seen the nigga eyes when I told him 22
Like the other nigga face when I hit 'em for the 20
You know everybody round me getting muhfuckin' money
I ain't forget to pray but I ain't go to church on sunday
I was selling pounds tryna break 'em down to onions (God damn there he go)
These niggas hate it when they see me on the radio, they even played a nigga on the TV
These niggas late, I told these niggas I was great they ain't believe me
I hit the crowd the people squeeze me they be screamin' Baby Jesus
Fucked around and made a 20 yesterday from sellin' reefer
Made another 45 hunnid doin' niggas features
Imma turn a 25 to a 50, double that and bring it back to the family everybody round me eatin'
And if I'm on the stage and nigga in the crowd play crazy we gon' jump up off the stage we gon' beat him
I cut a couple side hoes off, cause I don't got the time of the day for them bitches I don't need 'em
All the labels lookin' at me cut the muhfuckin' check
'Cause I ain't seen a rapper out here fuckin' with me yet
I'm holding up a rollie on my muhfuckin' wrist
And I'm dancin' round with diamonds on my muhfuckin' neck
Fuckin' on her good like I'm tryna break a sweat
I just hopped up off a flight, flew to Charlotte overnight
I don't wanna be killer, I don't think you wanna die
That's a muhfuckin' 40, put it in a nigga life
What the fuck a nigga mean, fuck is on a nigga mind
Why he wanna fuck with me? I was out here doing fine
Book the show and pay the fee Imma turn up every time
I'm too busy on the grind, don't try now to hit my line
