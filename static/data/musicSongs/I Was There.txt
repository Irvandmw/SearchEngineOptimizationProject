Lyrics:


I was there that night in Bethlehem
And when Neil and the boys came to the moon in that tin can
At Gettysburg, Omaha Beach, in Vietnam
I heard every soldier's cry and every mama's prayer
I was there

I was there when you took your first breath
And when you lit that stolen Lucky Strike
And liked to choke to death
When you were waist deep in Carter's Creek and preacher John
Dunked you down in the water and raised you up for air
I was there

I'm always around
I was then and I am now
And I'll be here when tomorrow comes
When a road comes to an end
I'm where you start again
I'm never farther than a word away
You've always got a friend

When your grandma passed, I was in that house
And when your grandpa ran down the streets of gold to show her around
I was there

I'm always around
I was then and I am now
And I'll be here when tomorrow comes
When a road comes to an end
I'm where you start again
I'm never farther than a word away
You've always got a friend

I was there last night on Highway 9
When you answered the phone and ran right through that stop sign
I was in the cab of that big rig, in that trucker's ear
Made him swerve to the right and miss you by a hair
I was there

If you're feeling alone look up I'm the One who answers prayers
And I'm always there
