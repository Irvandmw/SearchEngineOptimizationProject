Lyrics:


Ain't gonna do the gig tonight
with the band

I'm going out of town tonight
oh yes I am

Sorry fans
sorry band
I couldn't keep my promise
I'll put on my coat and hit the road

[Chorus:]
Breaking up
breaking out
I am leaving now you can sing it loud

Have to stop
had enough
crying tough

Quit the race
give me space
cos I'm so tired of being a slave
when I'm going
I'll sing a different song

There's gonna be no wedding on
saturday

I will be on my way then
so far away

Sorry mom
sorry honey
I couldn't keep me promise
I'll ripp off my tie and say goodbye

[Chorus:]
Breaking up
breaking out
I am leaving now you can sing it loud

Have to stop
had enough
crying tough

Quit the race
give me space
cos I'm so tired of being a slave
when I'm going
I'll sing a different song
