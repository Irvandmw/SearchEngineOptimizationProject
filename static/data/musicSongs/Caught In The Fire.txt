Lyrics:


Ah, the world on fire
Let's celebrate, let's have a toast while we sit and we watch
The whole world go up in flames (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
We lost our minds (Lost it)
We goin' cray (Cray)
We let a racist orange man be the president
Ain't that just fuckin' great? (The fuck, man)
But we just runnin' around, chasin' the lettuce
I bought a Benz, still feel pathetic
Ice on my wrist, still feel depression
Music my therapy, it's my obsession
Spittin' these bars, handin' out lessons
Don't go to church, but I'm makin' confessions
Fly like a bird, makin' impressions
I got the answers just give me your questions

We've been caught in the fire
We've lost our desire
We're beaten and blue
I pray we save us from ourselves (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
'Cause nobody else can do that for you (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
I feel like

One of one, bitch, I'm original
And I feel like Steph Curry with the finger roll
And I feel like Aaron Rodgers with the give and go
Hope this click inside your head like a metronome
How many times do the kid gotta run?
I'll let all of you know I'm the truth
Not chasing people's opinion of me
'Cause I really got nothing to prove
Not even ill when I'm makin' these songs
My soul is up in the booth
Found my place, I'll never leave
It's me, the crowd, they singin' free like (Ayy)
My generation is the truth (Ayy-Ayy), yeah
I believe in me and you (Ayy), yeah
Bitch, the future is the youth (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
Let me show you what we do
Let me show you what we

We've been caught in the fire
We've lost our desire
We're beaten and blue
I pray we save us from ourselves (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
'Cause nobody else can do that for you (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
I feel like

We wanna be free
Just wanna feel something
Just wanna feel something
We wanna be free
Just wanna feel something
Just wanna feel something
