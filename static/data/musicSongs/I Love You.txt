Lyrics:


I love you, 
Hums an April breeze, 
I love you, 
Echo the hills! 

I love you, 
The golden dawn agrees, 
As once more she sees, 
Daffodils! 

It's spring again, 
And birds on the wing again, 
Start to sing again, 
The old melodies! 

I love you, 
That's the Song of Songs, 
And it all belongs, 
To you and me 

I love you... 
Hums an April breeze, 
I love you... 
Echo the hills! 

I love you... 
The golden dawn agrees, 
As once more she sees, 
Daffodils! 

It's spring again, 
And birds on the wing again, 
Start to sing again, 
The old melodies! (mellow, melodies...) 

I love you, 
That's the Song of Songs, 
And it all belongs, 
To you and me. 
And it all belongs, 
To you and me!
