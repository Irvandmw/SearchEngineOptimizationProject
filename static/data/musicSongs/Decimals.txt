Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I need my decimals
I hear 'em, they talk in the city, they sayin' I'm next to blow
Lock it, re-rock it, this shipment, we got it from Mexico
He play with the green, I turn that nigga to a vegetable (Woo)
'Cause I need my decimals (Yeah)
You can't tell me nothin', I already know (I already know)
Young hothead nigga, I was always tryna go
And we don't call niggas, nigga we just put the tap on the toe
Ask fortune later, then I gotta go (Then I gotta skrrt)

I get to the money, 'lil nigga
Twenty fifties and the hunnids, 'lil nigga
I be out here, countin' hundred thousands
You ain't ever had no money 'lil nigga
Got a Fanta from the 7-11, I'm 'bout to pour another four
Get it backward, then I go
That bitch opened up the door
I gave her the trap block, told her, "Meet me at the pen"
We was runnin' out the pens, trade the Chevy for a Benz
Painted white, thought a young nigga would be livin' out like this
I don't know these nigga's pressure, this a Rollie, that's my only friend
I was pushin' out the bales and I'm gon' drop a fifth
Where we was at was the bale, mama put that on the wrist
See me hoppin' out McLaren's, she gon' look at the powder rinse
See the way I count the bands, you know that I was bound for this

I need my decimals
I hear 'em, they talk in the city, they sayin' I'm next to blow
Lock it, re-rock it, this shipment, we got it from Mexico
He play with the green, I turn that nigga to a vegetable (Woo)
'Cause I need my decimals (Yeah)
You can't tell me nothin', I already know (I already know)
Young hothead nigga, I was always tryna go
And we don't call niggas, nigga we just put the tap on the toe
Ask fortune later, then I gotta go (Then I gotta skrrt)

[Skeme:]
I have the decimals, yeah, I'm havin' digits on digits (Hey)
I got your ho in my home, playin' dome for me
'Cause she like the way that I kick it (Oh)
I'm makin' moves with the money
I'm ballin', the trap and the shit, I pick up my payments (Huh)
Shawty can be one of the baddest bitches
But she pay with the pimps, treat her like a pidgeon
I work all day on a Saturday, makin' moves
If you broke, you irrelevant
If you mad at me, why you textin' then?
I swear that white go so flashy and flexible
We are the best and I'm actin' incredible
I want the meals and the bitch like I'm exceptional
I want to make a withdrawal out the bank
There ain't nothin' left in there (Oh)

[Roddy Ricch:]
I need my decimals
I hear 'em, they talk in the city, they sayin' I'm next to blow
Lock it, re-rock it, this shipment, we got it from Mexico
He play with the green, I turn that nigga to a vegetable (Woo)
'Cause I need my decimals (Yeah)
You can't tell me nothin', I already know (I already know)
Young hothead nigga, I was always tryna go
And we don't call niggas, nigga we just put the tap on the toe
Ask fortune later, then I gotta go (Then I gotta skrrt)

Yeah, yeah
