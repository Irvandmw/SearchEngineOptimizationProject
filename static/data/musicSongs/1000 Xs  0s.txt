Lyrics:


(Page 1) You work so hard, you really do
I don't think that anyone could work as hard as you
Hot desert sun, you can feel the heat
Every drop of sweat on your brow is well earned so you best believe

I got 1, 000 hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby
I got 1, 000 hugs and kisses for you when you come back home, baby

(Turn the page) When you give 'em your all, and still it's only second best
You can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest
Every one of your worries (all your worries)
All your miseries (all your miseries)
You can put them in a little boat and ship them off 2 sea
Cause...

I got a 1, 000 hugs and kisses for you when you come back home baby ooooo
I got a 1, 000 hugs and kisses for you when you come back home baby ooooo

I got a 1, 000 hugs and kisses for you when you come back home
Come here!

The world can be, well 2 put it frankly, such a bitch sometimes
Seems like love that lasts 4ever is kinda hard 2 find
Most of the people we know just lookin' for a reason 2 cry
As long as you got me I got your back and this is why

You work so hard, you really do
I don't think that anyone could work as hard as you
You can lock the door, you better turn off your phone
Cause I'm gonna give 1, 000 reasons why we need 2 be alone.
Ohhhh ohhh oooo

I got 1, 000 hugs for you, baby, when you get back home
When you get back home.

Suga babe oooooh

I wanna hold you, tie you up in lace
I wanna kiss you, kiss you all over your face
I wanna love ya, all up and down
Give you love like you never had, blindfold, gagged and bound

I wanna love ya baby
One time
Two times
Three times uh

I got 1, 000 hugs and kisses, when you come back home, baby

Love you up and love you down
Give you love 'til you make them sounds
