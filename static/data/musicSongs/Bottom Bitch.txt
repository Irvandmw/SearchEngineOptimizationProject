Lyrics:


Ooh, that's my trick
I'm her pimp, she my flip
Ooh, don't forget, that's my trick
She my bottom bitch

Ooh, that's my trick
I'm her pimp, she my flip
Ooh, don't forget, that's my trick
She my bottom bitch

That's my hoe
That's my doe
That's my glow up
She go hard, she just like a pro
She just wanna blow up

If you talkin' shit
Wipe your spit of my nuts, nigga grow up
On the boat like I'm Noah
On Xan like I'm Noah
Damn I don't know her no more

And she buy the crib
Then she buy the whip
In a Prada fit
Got some Gucci kicks
That's my bottom bitch
'Cause she bout it bitch
And I'm proud of it

Ooh, that's my trick
I'm her pimp, she my flip
Ooh, don't forget, that's my trick
She my bottom bitch

Ooh, that's my trick
I'm her pimp, she my flip
Ooh, don't forget, that's my trick
She my bottom bitch

She don't create no problems
That's why the bitch my bottom
And she look like model, ooh
She ain't no rat, she possum
All up in that concoction
Personal coochie popper, ooh
Slip into something pretty
I need to be this faded
Baby gon' get her way, ooh
Baby, don't keep me waiting
Baby boy, what you paying?
Drop it and I ain't gon' stay with y'all

'Cause I know what you want
Don't lie (Don't lie)
You want something for one night

Ooh, that's my trick
I'm her pimp, she my flip
Ooh, don't forget, that's my trick
She my bottom bitch

Ooh, that's my trick
I'm her pimp, she my flip
Ooh, don't forget, that's my trick
She my bottom bitch

Ooh, that's my trick
I'm her pimp, she my flip
Ooh, don't forget, that's my trick
My bottom bitch

Ooh, that's my trick
I'm her pimp, she my flip
Ooh, don't forget, that's my trick
My bottom bitch

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
