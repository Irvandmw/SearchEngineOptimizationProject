Lyrics:


Let me see the wind in your hair
Let me hold you near
And 'cause today the ocean is blue
And the world is new

We know that bridges will burn
We know that tables will turn
Oh, but today we are unconcerned

Let your fingers touch my face
As a gift of grace
Lay your head down in the grass
Let our troubles pass

We know that bridges will burn
And there is so much to learn
Oh, but today we are unconcerned

Is it a part of life
The good and the bad must fight
Will there be someone here
In a thousand years

We know that bridges will burn
We know that tables will turn
Oh, but today we are unconcerned

When we see the elephants running
Then we'll know something bad is coming
Trying to forget our fears
Holding each other near
When we see the armies running
We can hear the darkness is coming
Listen to a worry bird
Between heaven and earth
[repeat to fade]
