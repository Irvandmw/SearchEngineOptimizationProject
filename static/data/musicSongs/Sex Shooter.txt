Lyrics:


I need you to get me off
I'm a bomb gettin' ready to explode
I need you to get me off
Be your slave do anything I'm told

I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affections

I need you to pull my trigger baby
I can't do it alone
I need you to be my main play thing pillar of stone

I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affections

Come on kiss the gun (Uh)
Ohh-oo-oh
Ohh-oo-oh
Ohh-oo-oh
Ohh-oo-oh

Sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction (Mm)
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affections

No girls body can compete with mine
No girls rap can top my lines
No girls kiss can ring your chimes
Come on boy lets make some time

I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affections
Sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
Uh I can't hear you
Sex shooter
Come and play with my affections
All the nasty people sing it yeah
