Lyrics:


Take a piece of chalk, draw a line
Around the world about a hundred times
And that's how far I'd go For Your sweet love

Count all the rain in a million years
Make believe it's a million tears
Well, that's how much I'd cry for your sweet love

Here's everything that your worth to me
In one simple line
I'd go to the ends of the earth to be
Near you all the time

If I owned the earth with it's mountains high
The sun, the moon and the stars in the sky
We'll that's how much I'd give for your sweet love

Here's everything that your worth to me
In one simple line
I'd go to the ends of the earth to be
Near you all the time

If I owned the earth with it's mountains high
The sun, the moon and the stars in the sky
We'll that's how much I'd give for your sweet love

Umm, for your sweet love
Woh, for your sweet love
