Lyrics:


Boy you left me feeling down
Now I'm drowning to the ground
Ain't nobody coming to save me
No-o
Boy you left me sinking low
Waters rising to my nose
Ain't nobody gonna save me
So why'd you have to go?
I said why'd you have to go?

Oh listen boy
So you left me in the dark
Yeah you left me all alone
And with all your lies I should have known
That I wasn't your work of art
No you didn't care much for me
But I'm telling you
These tears are not for you, they're for me

(I've been) yes I've been (been searching) I've been searching, for the ones remaining, you know the one that they call love, oh
(I've been) yes I've been (been searching) I've been searching, everywhere you know, so baby why'd you have to go, oh?

Boy you left me feeling down
Now I'm drowning to the ground
Ain't nobody coming to save me
No-o
Boy you left me sinking low
Waters rising to my nose
Ain't nobody gonna save me
So why'd you have to go?
I said why'd you have to go?

Well here's what I'm about to do
I'm about to say it all to you
Let it all out
Having no doubts
Baby you, shouldn't have gone away
I'd love it if you would stay
But whether or not your still gone and I

(I've been) yes I've been (been searching) I've been searching, for the ones remaining, you know the one that they call love, oh
(I've been) yes I've been (been searching) I've been searching, everywhere you know, so baby why'd you have to go, oh?

Boy you left me feeling down
Now I'm drowning to the ground
Ain't nobody coming to save me
No-o
Boy you left me sinking low
Waters rising to my nose
Ain't nobody gonna save me
So why'd you have to go?
I said why'd you have to go?

You swore that you would never go
But you're not around me anymore
I'm scarred from memories
I be heading out the door
And I can't I can't take it no more
Yeah

Boy you left me feeling down
Now I'm drowning to the ground
Ain't nobody coming to save me
No-o
Boy you left me sinking low
Waters rising to my nose
Ain't nobody gonna save me
So why'd you have to go?
I said why'd you have to go?

Boy you left me feeling down
Now I'm drowning to the ground
Ain't nobody coming to save me
No-o
Boy you left me sinking low
Waters rising to my nose
Ain't nobody gonna save me
So why'd you have to go?
I said why'd you have to go?
