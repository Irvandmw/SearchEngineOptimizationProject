[Selena Gomez:]
Crazy
I like that, you like that, so let's be crazy
The contact, impact, I want that daily
Our breath getting deeper, deeper, lately
I like that, baby

'Cause I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough of your love
Give me some more, I love it
I can't get enough, yeah
'Cause I can't get enough

[J Balvin:]
(Leggo')
Dice que no le es suficiente (Wuh)
'TÃ¡ mal de la mente (Yah)
Cuando estÃ¡ solita que entre (Eh)
MÃºsica para ponerla en ambiente, yeh-yeah
Ella quiere que lo hagamo' como aquella ve' (Yah)
Le busquÃ© otro trago por si tenÃ­a sed (Uh)
To' lo que se pone bonito se le ve (Bonito se le ve)
Empezamo' a pie y ahora andamo' en el je' (Wuh)

Vamo' a calentar
Baby, tÃº va' a subir y a bajar
No se quiere olvidar, lo quiere recordar
Baby, yo quiero entrar

[Selena Gomez & J Balvin:]
'Cause I can't get enough (Yah)
Yeah, I can't get enough (Yah, Latino gang)
Yeah, I can't get enough of your love
Give me some more, I love it
I can't get enough, yeah (Come on)
'Cause I can't, can't

[Selena Gomez:]
Crazy
I like that, you like that, so let's be crazy
The contact, impact, I want that daily
Our breath getting deeper, deeper, lately
I like that, baby (Yeah)

[Selena Gomez & J Balvin:]
Uuh, no one's gotta know, we can keep it lowkey
I'll be fine alone, long as you're alone with me (Tell 'em)
So incredible, unforgettable on me
Keep your body on me (Leggo', leggo', Tainy, come on)

'Cause I can't get enough (Benny, Benny Blanco)
Yeah, I can't get enough (J Balvin, men; Selena)
Yeah, I can't get enough of your love
Give me some more, I love it
I can't get enough, yeah
'Cause I can't get enough
