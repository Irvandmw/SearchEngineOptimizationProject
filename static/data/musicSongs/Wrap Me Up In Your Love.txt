Lyrics:


Wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love

Let's enjoy the holiday
Be here and now
This time and place

Laughter while the children play
These memories
They'll never fade

Let them open every gift
And while they do
We'll sneak a kiss

And baby when the day is through
My only gift is you

Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love
You've been at the top of my wish list
Hope that I've been good enough

This season, you're my reason
Oh, you know just what I want
Both giving, both receiving
So wrap me up in your love

We don't need no mistletoe
I'll kiss you, love
Everywhere you go

There's nothing left here but the tree
The fireplace
And you and me

We'll pour another glass of wine
It's almost midnight
This is our time
And we won't even feel the cold
We can let it snow

Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love
You've been at the top of my wish list
Hope that I've been good enough

This season, you're my reason
You're the only one I want
Both giving, both receiving
So wrap me up in your love

This season, you're my reason
You're the only one I want
Both giving, both receiving
So wrap me up in your love

Look out of the window
It's a snow globe
Baby shake it, can you shake it

Light the candle
And let the fire glow
And I'll hold you close

Wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love
