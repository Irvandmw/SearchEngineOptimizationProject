Lyrics:


(In Napoli where love is king
When boy meets girl here's what they say)

When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling
And you'll sing "Vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fasule
That's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not dreaming, signore
Scusa mi, but you see, back in old Napoli
That's amore

When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore (That's amore)
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore (That's amore)
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling
And you'll sing "Vita bella" (Vita bellâVita bella)
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella (lucky fella)

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fasule
That's amore (That's amore)
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not dreaming, signore
Scusa mi, but you see, back in old Napoli
That's amore (amore)
That's amore
