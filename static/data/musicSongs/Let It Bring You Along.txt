Song Name: Let It Bring You Along
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


The darkest house is a lonely house
The warmest house is my song
And if it makes you, all but happy
Let it bring you along

The sweetest room is a lady
The softest tune is goodbye
Is she real or just an image
Dis she leave satisfied

The life you lead is uncertain
How long has it been since you've heard hello or goodbye

Streets are filled with many people passin'
My eyes they are closed but still you hear them cry

The darkest house is a lonely house
The warmest house is my song
And if it makes you, all but happy
Let it bring you along

Silver and gold are treasures
To many people this is why they've dared the tide
The thought of fortune pulls them through tomorrow
Is it worth the feeling when you fall into her eyes
