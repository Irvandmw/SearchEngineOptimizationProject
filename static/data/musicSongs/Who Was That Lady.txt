Lyrics:


Who was that lady
That fabulous lady
That lady I saw you with last night

Tell me, was she an angel
If she was an angel
She sure kept her wings out of sight

Pardon my asking but was she thrilling
And was she willing to kiss the evening away
Say who was that lady
I knew such a lady
And foolishly let her out of my life
So if she's the one
Please spare me the pun
I'd sure miss the fun in that was no lady
That was my wife

Who was that lady
I knew such a lady
And foolishly let her out of my life
So if she's the one
Please spare me the pun
I'd sure miss the fun in that old crawler
No joke is duller
Than that was no lady
That was my wife
