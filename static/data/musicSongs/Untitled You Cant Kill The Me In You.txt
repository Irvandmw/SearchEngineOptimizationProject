Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I know a secret
Something still belongs to me
I'm not afraid of those who kill the body
For still they cannot kill the soul

You may beat me down just denying the truth
But you can't kill the me in you

Dreams are illusions
They fade away before we can catch them
Promises may be broken dreams we'll forget
But what's birthed in you cannot die

You may beat me down just denying the truth
But you can't kill the me in you

(You may beat me down just denying the truth)
(But you can't kill the me in you)
You may beat me down just denying the truth
But you can't kill the me in you
(You may beat me down just denying the truth)
(But you can't kill the me in you)
You may beat me down just denying the truth
But you can't kill the me in you
(You may beat me down just denying the truth)
(But you can't kill the me in you)
You may beat me down just denying the truth
But you can't kill the me in you
(You may beat me down just denying the truth)
(But you can't kill the me in you)
