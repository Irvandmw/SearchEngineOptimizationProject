Lyrics:


I'd be sitting in the same old bar
Heart breaking on a broken bar stool
Wishing she'd come running back
Running from the past
Running up the tab drinking for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town, had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't

'Cause I'd never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd never lost her
Then I'd never found you
Oh, I'd never found you
Never found you

Yeah still go out sometimes
But I don't never try to get that drunk
Now I can't even sleep because you're all over me
In the sheets all night keeping me up
Yeah it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me

No I'd never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd never lost her
Then I'd never found you
Oh I'd never found you
Oh, I'd never found you

And now I'm taking back the way I said I wish I've never met
Sometimes the things that don't work out
Couldn't work out any better

I'd never found you
Oh, I'd never found you

'Cause I'd never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd never lost her
Then I'd never found you
Oh, I'd never found you
Never found, never found you
Oh, I'd never found you
