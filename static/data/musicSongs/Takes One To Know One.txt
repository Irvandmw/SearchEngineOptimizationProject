Lyrics:


What are you looking at?
(Yeah)

I saw this coming from a mile away
I saw a crack in the egg
A little rip in the page

I found your necklace on the floor
Underneath the bed
Where you said
I was the only one

You thought I'd cry
(You-thought-I'd-cry)
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you
(Ha-ha)

And all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too

Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
But the knife is in your back
(In-your-back)

You left your suit, you left your tie
And looked me in the eye
And swore that it was business baby
(Yeah, right)

And when you left I got a call
That started it all
And now it's not your business baby

You thought I'd cry
(You-thought-I'd-cry)
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you
(Ha-Ha)

But all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too

Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife is in your back
(In-your-back)

You're such a wreck
The cutest accident
Makes so much sense
You'll come back to me, oh

And I'll let you

Hey
Huh
You're back

Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife is in you're back
(In-your-back)

Cause' it takes one, to know one
(Hi, nice to meet you)
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here heartbroken
(I'll-lie-here)
But the knife is in your back
(In-your-back)
