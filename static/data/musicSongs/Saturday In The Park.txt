Lyrics:


Saturday in the park
I think it was the 4th of July
Saturday in the park
I think it was the 4th of July

People dancing, people laughing
A man selling ice-cream singing Italian songs
[Foreign Content]
Can you dig it? Yes I can
And I've been waiting such a long time for Saturday

Another day in the park
I think it was the 4th of July
Another day in the park
I think it was the 4th of July

People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar and singing for us all
Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it? Yes I can

And I've been waiting such a long time for today

Slow motion riders fly the colors of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children all is not lost, all is not lost, oh no, no

Funny days in the park
Every day's the 4th of July
Funny days in the park
Every day's the 4th of July

People reaching, people touching
A real celebration waiting for us all
If we want it, really want it
Can you dig it? Yes I can
And I've been waiting such a long time for the day
