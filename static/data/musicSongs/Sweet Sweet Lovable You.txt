Lyrics:


I thought that I'd love before but now I can tell ye
I've never lost until I have ye
I'll never leave sweet sweet lovable you
You make me so happy
True love is here you'll never be lonely
Forget your fears cause I love you only
I'll never leave sweet sweet lovable you
I may look around and tease me another ah once in a while
But you're only dear I'll hurry right home
Cause I love your smile you're just my style
How could I ever think of another now that I found love so true
I'll never leave sweet sweet lovable you
I'll never leave sweet sweet lovable you
You make me so happy
I'll never leave sweet sweet lovable you
I may look around...
