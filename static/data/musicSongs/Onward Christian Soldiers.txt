Lyrics:


Onward, Christian soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!

Christ the royal master
Leads against the foe
Forward into battle
See his banners go!

Onward, Christian soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!

Like a might army
Moves the church of god!
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod!

We are not divided
All one body we

One in hope and doctrine
One in charity!

Onward, Christian soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!

Onward. Then, ye people!
Join our happy throng!
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song!
Glory laud and honour
Unto Christ the king
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing

Onward, Christian soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!
Amen
