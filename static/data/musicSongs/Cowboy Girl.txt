Lyrics:


She got an old Silverado and forty-seven acres
She played the hack so loud she blew out her speakers

She gotta neon Bud sign hanging in the kitchen
And a Texas longstalk stitched on her britches

She keeps a double barrel next to the bed
Got a little money shaker that'll knock ya dead

She's a cowboy girl, tough on the leather
Wilder than the Fourth of July
She's a cowboy girl, if you wanna catch her
Man, you better know how to ride

She puts on her boots and drives to the city
Them uptown boys, they all think she's pretty

Oh, but she don't want your black Mazeradi
She wants a dirt bike mud ride out in the country
She's a sweet little twister in a Stetson hat
Let me tell ya mister, nothing wrong with that

She's a cowboy girl, tough on the leather
Wilder than the Fourth of July
She's a cowboy girl, if you wanna catch her
Man, you better know how
Man, you better know how to ride

Ow, ride em girl

She's a bona fide, southern fried
Friday night queen
Knock em down drag em out
Honkey tonk dream
I gotta get her with me

She's a cowboy girl, tough on the leather
Wilder than the Fourth of July
She's a cowboy girl, if you wanna catch her
You're gonna have to chase that cowboy girl
Tough on the leather
Wilder than the Fourth of July
She's a cowboy girl, if you wanna catch her
Man, you better know how
Man, you better know how to ride
Ah, yeah
Man, you better know how to ride
