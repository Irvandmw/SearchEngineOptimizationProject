Lyrics:


Ooh, baby
You give me such a good good feeling
So good baby, hey

When I think about you, baby, baby
I get all warm inside
When I think about you, baby, baby
I have a heart attack, I'm holding back my pride

Get that same old good good felling
And I get all hurt and weak and sad
I wanna give you this love that I'm feeling
Don't let this sweet emotion be denied

Ooh... baby, feeling so good, ooh baby
Ooh... baby, feeling so good, yeah baby

When I think about you, baby, oh baby
Feel so, feel so, ooh, good to me
When I think about you, baby, sweet baby
This good thing still go on endlessly

I see your face ever so wanted
And your sparkling eyes and your winning smile
Keep on loving me the same way darling
It can come true if only for a little while

Ooh... baby, ooh baby
Ooh... honey, ooh, honey, yeah
Ooh... baby

Yeah, I want this feeling to last forever
Sure want this feeling to last forever
I want this feeling to last forever, yes
Ever, ever

Ooh... baby, feeling so good
Ooh... honey, feeling so good, oh honey
Ooh... yeah baby
Ooh, baby, come on baby
