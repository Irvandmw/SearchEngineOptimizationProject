Lyrics:


I'm feeling your vibe, you got my attention
When you walked in here with nobody with you
Girl if there ain't a guy in the picture, I wanna be
Tell me your story, I'm all ears to listen
Don't spare no details, go on, get specific
I know we just met but I already miss you, honestly

I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinking
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinking
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl, I don't wanna love you just for one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only

I wanna be your Friday's, baby
And your Tuesday's too
24/7 lovin' up on you
Introduce me to your friends
I want to shake your daddy's hand
Be your all the time kind of man

I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinking
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinking
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
I don't wanna love you just for one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only

I'm feeling your vibe, you got my attention
When you walked in here with nobody with you
Girl, if there ain't a guy in the picture, I wanna be

But I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinking
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinking
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl, I don't wanna love you just for one night only
Yeah, one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only
Yeah, one night only
