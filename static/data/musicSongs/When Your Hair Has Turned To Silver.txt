Lyrics:


(I will love you just the same)

When your hair has turned to silver
I will love you just the same
I will only call you sweetheart
That will always be your name

Through a garden filled with roses
Down the sunset trail we'll stray
When your hair has turned to silver
I will love you as today

Through a garden filled with roses
Down the sunset trail we'll stray
When your hair has turned to silver
I will love you as today
