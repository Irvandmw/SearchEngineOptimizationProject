Lyrics:


I took a sip of the potion
Lilâ SK, a little Goose, now Iâm loose

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
Quest for the cheddar I bought shiny Beretta
Iâm firing squad hard, you niggas should know better
Than to bump with Ferrari, calamari
I kill like rebels in , Iâm sorry
I ball like I think Iâm the Prince of Abu Dhabi
Black gold gush out the ground
Gun powder fly out the pound
I turn a clown smile upside down
Thatâs 3 time zones in my watch face
Still hard to tell time with diamonds all over my watch face
Twinkle like Iâm outta space, Iâm a big dipper
You a little dipper, pipe down little nigga
Nice wheels, but donât talk money, that's what Iâm about
I could fit your house inside my house
And your neighbours and ya yard, oh my God
This shit ain't about shit so I ain't gonâ go hard
Now kick push, kick pushâ¦get the fuck outta here
Kick push

[Hook]
Youâre now being hypnotised, close your eyes
And say 50â²s my favorite, fifty, fiftyâs my favorite
Iâm not the the one to play with, I mean what I say bitch
50â²s my favorite, 50, 50â²s my favorite
Still on that gutta shit, forever on that gutta shit
50â²s my favorite, 50, 50â²s my favorite
I know you love that shit, real niggas be loving this
50â²s my favorite, 50, 50â²s my favorite

[Verse 2]
Oh shit now a nigga floatinâ
That Luger German, that's Kush burning
Iâm Einstein on the grind
My wheels turning, Iâm out in cali not in Hollywood
Silicon valley, Iâm bout to get rich
I mean real rich, Iâm talking Facebook and Spotify type shit
Iâm not a programmer, I use ghetto grammar
Slang, Iâm strong as David Banner
The Hulk, my money come in bulk
And if this shit go bad, I go back to the dope
And I pay attention to the murder I wrote
This my light shit, my heavy shit on the album
Lets get right bitch

[Hook]
