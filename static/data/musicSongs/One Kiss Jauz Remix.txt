One
One
One
One
One

Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

Something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
(I look like)
(I look like)
(I look like)
(I look like)
(I look like, I, I, I look like)
(I look like)
(I look like)
(I-I-I look like)
(I look like, I look like)

One
Time
One

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I-I look like
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

See a wonderland in your eyes
Might need your company tonight

Something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you... need
I look, I look, I-I-I look
Like, like, like, need

One
Take my time
One

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look, I-I-I look like
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
