Lyrics:


Too many feet on the disco
Let's go somewhere so we can be alone
Just like a shell on the seashore
Baby I wanna take you home

I play by a different set of rules
Dealing with someone like you
Keep you around like you're in my crew
Hold me down like I depend on you

I don't ever wanna think for one second
That messing around with you is the wrong decision
'Cause someone just like you has got a girl thinking
That you got the type of love that I be missin'

Yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Like I'm trapped under a wave
I'll be missin' you from death

I felt your eyes and it hit me
Heard my heart skipping a beat
Wanna feel you breathing on my body

I play by a different set of rules
So you better be ready for what I might do
When it's me and you

I don't ever wanna think for one second
That messing around with you is the wrong decision
'Cause someone just like you has got a girl thinking
That you got the type of love that I be missin'

Yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Like I'm trapped under a wave
I'll be missin' you from death

And for now I'll be still
Until you come back to me, yeah
I'll use my will
And miss you for it

Oh, missin' your love
Missin' you and I
Missin' you, missin' you
Miss you, yeah

I don't ever wanna think for one second
That messing around with you is the wrong decision
'Cause someone just like you has got a girl thinking
That you got the type of love that I be missin'

Yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Like I'm trapped under a wave
I'll be missin' you from death

Missin' you, missin' you
Hey, hey
