Lyrics:


I don't know you
You don't know me
Think you got the wrong one, one
You must have the wrong one, one
Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen

Hoes wanna talk like I give a fuck
Like you ain't been shit while I been too much
And you thinking you got all the 411
Cat got your tongue, bitch
Cat got your tongue

Hoes wanna talk like I give a fuck
Like you ain't been shit while I been too much
And you thinking you got all the 411
Cat got your tongue, bitch
Cat got your tongue

Bitch you a crumb
Look like a thumb
Glad that you're stupid
Glad that you're dumb
You give me lip
Should give me tongue
Where are the fucks?
'Cause I ain't got one
Child do your chores
Sweep up the floors
I go on tour
You on ignore, bitch
These Michael Jord
This Michael Kors
Fuckin for bags
Can't love these whores

You don't wanna tempt me
Should keep a chopper in my Bentley
I'm real cute but I'm not friendly
You ain't too good at hiding envy

Hoes wanna talk like I give a fuck
Like you ain't been shit while I been too much
And you thinking you got all the 411, yeah
Cat got your tongue, bitch
Cat got your tongue

Hoes wanna talk like I give a fuck
Like you ain't been shit while I been too much
And you thinking you got all the 411, yeah
Cat got your tongue, bitch
Cat got your tongue
Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen

"Maaaaan your best bet is to take the little bit that you're getting and sit your little ass down
Like calm down. Before I humble you and you know like I know that I will humble you. So carry on."

Carry on
Just carry on
Get that derrier
And dereon
Runnin circles round you bitches like a marathon
Wait till you ain't even round
Won't be very long
Don't be petty
Look at the light you're shedding
Expose yoself
You gon be there regretting
Popping out
Little bit like confetti
Doin the most with the little bit that you're getting
You forgetting
She don't know where she heading
You must love me, too bad you ain't gon get no wedding
All my goons round this is just not the setting
See right through that ass like 99 cent store leggings

You don't wanna tempt me
Should keep a chopper in my Bentley
I'm real cute but I'm not friendly
You ain't too good at hiding envy

I don't know you
You don't
Know me
You got the wrong one, one
(Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen)
You must have the wrong one, one
(Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen)

I don't know you
You don't
Know me
Think you got the wrong one, one
You must have the wrong one, one
(Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen)

Hoes wanna talk like I give a fuck
Like you ain't been shit while I been too much
And you thinking you got all the 411, yeah
Cat got your tongue, bitch
Cat got your tongue
Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen

Hoes wanna talk like I give a fuck
Like you ain't been shit while I been too much
And you thinking you got all the 411, yeah
Cat got your tongue, bitch
Cat got your tongue
Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen

Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen
Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong one
Hoe
Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen
Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen
