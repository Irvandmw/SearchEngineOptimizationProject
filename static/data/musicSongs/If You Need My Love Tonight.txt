Lyrics:


Inside my mind the hands of time rewind
To when youâre love was mine so magically
We shared a song and even though itâs gone
I can still recall the melody
Donât be scared if you lie awake in the dark  (I wonât be afraid, baby)
Cause I still truly care with all my heart

If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And Iâm always here when you need a friend
If you need my love tonight I promise to keep you from falling
And Iâll stay with you if you need my love tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

So soft and pure, your love was the cure
Then I felt lost and so alone
Now itâs my turn to give you what you yearn
Return the love that you have always shown
And what a joy if I could see you once again  (oh, I see you tonight, baby)
I will treat you so right youâre my body and soul

If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And Iâm always here when you need a friend
If you need my love tonight I promise to keep you from falling
And Iâll stay with you if you need my love tonight
Oh, tonight, oooh, tonight Iâll be there, yeah, oooh

If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And Iâm always here when you need a friend  (when you need a friend)
If you need my love tonight I promise to keep you from falling
And Iâll stay with you if you need my love tonight  (Iâll stay with you late, with you baby)
If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And Iâm always here when you need a friend
Tonight
