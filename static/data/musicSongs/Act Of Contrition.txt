Lyrics:
Lyrics:


O My God, I am heartily sorry, 
For having offended Thee,
And I detest all my sins, 
Because I dread the loss of heaven, 
And the pains of Hell, 
But most of all because I have offended Thee My God,
Who art all good and deserving of all my love, 
I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, 

To confess my sin, to do penance,
And to amend my life, 
Amen
