Lyrics:


Drink all night, never sleep
You say go, I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

Not today, mascara's running down your face again
I can feel it coming down on me
Hurricane insert name
We're good at this game, game

We fuck and we fight, then you call me a psycho
I walk out the door, but you won't let me let go
Turn right around, throwing rocks at your window
But I can't forget you and I'll always let you

Drink all night, never sleep
You say go, I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

Drink all night, never sleep
You say go, I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

Not today, I'm waking up to my mistakes again
I know you love to point them out
Baby, I'm sick of sadness and you're sick of Xanax
We're good at this game, game

We fuck and we fight, then you call me a psycho
I walk out the door, but you won't let me let go
Turn right around, throwing rocks at your window
But I can't forget you and I'll always let you

Drink all night, never sleep
You say go, I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

Drink all night, never sleep
You say go, I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

But not in the same way
But not in the same way

I don't ever wanna lie to you
But I can't say no to you
I know you think I'm bulletproof
But you know how to hurt me too
In the dark, we're black and white
In the morning, color-blind
Leave your mark with every bite
Then everything's alright

When you tell me you love me
Then you wanna leave me
Pouring your pills down the sink
Saying, "It's not what you think"
Don't know if I love you
Don't know if I hate you
But I can't forget you
And I'll always let you

Drink all night, never sleep
You say go, I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

Drink all night, never sleep
You say go, I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

But not in the same way
But not in the same way
