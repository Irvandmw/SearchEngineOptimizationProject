[Verse 1:]
Yeah, alright, yo
A couple days ago
I met the illest latina
Her demeanor was unexplainable
You shoulda seen her
Thick thighs, nice ass
Body like an hourglass
Didn't hesitate to break a brother
Next second she passed
I was like, "What's up?"
To which she replied
"How you doin'?"
I said de nada momma
But your beauty I'm persuin'
And I said I'm about to win the lottery
She asks "How?"
I said, "Your seven digits right now"
And made her smile
Now we conversing
And she feelin' my style
I can tell by the way she talkin'
That she down to go the mile
Had a couple drinks
Now we headed back to her place
The shade of red from her lipstick all over my face
I'm tryin' to hit, split it
Baby girl you gonna let me get it?
She said, "Hold up ok, I don't get down like that"
I said I know beautiful girl
But I get down like that
So let me heat it up, heat it up
Go crazy and beat it up
"Damn papi, how you even know I like it rough?"
The way you was feelin' on me
When kissing revealed enough
I wanna scratch you, provoke you
Bite you, choke you
But just a little, bite your legs
Dick up in the middle
"Hold up, wait a second
Nigga, you gotta condom?"
Come on beautiful girl of course I've got protection
I stay with Magnums and I ain't talkin' Smith and Wesson
I keep undressin'
Girl I'm about to teach you a lesson
After I hit it she says
"Bobby I have a confession
I think I love you!"
I said "What the fuck?"
Thinkin' to myself
Damn, I shoulda never cut
Kissed her on the cheek
Hit the lights, then she fell asleep
So I snuck out the bathroom window on the creep, like
(The next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, yo
The next day, the next day, the next)

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, yeah, yo
Now I'm out the door
Downtown is where I'm about to go
Got a meeting with my boy Chris
About a dope show
So I hail a cab, jump in
But so does some girl
Beautiful, pretty eyes
With luxurious curls
I said "No fair"
She smiled and said
"Why don't we share?"
What a success
Lookin' at her chest
Thinkin' if her breasts was a test
She would fail
Fresh tip nails
Type of ass make a brother
Train of thought derail
As we converse
I could tell that she feelin' my style
Get the pussy wet
That's the mission
As long as she listen to my words
Feelin' on the curves
Only lips I'm thinkin' bout kissin' is hers
I can barely fight the urge
Only thing that matter right now
Is these two verbs
I'm talkin' me and you
So fine, I'd think I'd start seeing you
Her body was a work of art
Like Hieroglyphics
Too much detail to go into specifics
Now
I'm diggin' shorty
Like an archeologist
Tryin' a bone
Searchin' for a queen to take the throne
The type of girl to love
And call her my own

[Verse 3:]
I'm just a bachelor (bachelor)
Looking for a bachelorette
Baby, maybe you can persuade me
To give you love
You couldn't imagine yet
Kiss you on the neck
Then I sedate the pussy like a vet
Got the shorty rollin' like a movie set
Take her to the Rio
I'm not talking about G-burg
I'm talking De Janeiro
Spend deÃ±ero like it's reverb
Expansion
Couple kids running round the mansion
Day dreamin'
Getting ahead of my self
Advancin'
But, come on... girl
Now come on give me love
I know we just met but
Romance is like a drug
You know we go together
Like sympathy and hugs
So I write this girl
A symphony
And tell her that I love
Her everything
Girl I love your everything
You know I love your everything
I said I love your everything
Yeah, love your everything
Girl, I love your everything
