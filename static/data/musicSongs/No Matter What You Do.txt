Lyrics:


What you want-a, I could be-a, I would go anywhere for you
If you need me I'll be here, yeah, no matter what you do

So here's the problem, now let me lay it down
We got so much to give yet no one ever comes around
Ooh boy I found you, not gonna let you go
You're what I want, yeah, you're all I'll ever know

Yeah I can change for you, that's what I'll do
Cause I would give my all, I won't let you fall
There's nothing else I'd want at all

What you want-a, I could be-a, I would go anywhere for you
If you need me I'll be here, yeah, no matter what you do

Now that it's clear, you're finally in my life
And yeah I can see that I'm pretty lucky, baby
Ooh yeah you're special, you mean a lot to me
And I would do almost anything cause you're all I see, baby

Yeah I can change for you, that's what I'll do
Cause I would give my all, I won't let you fall
There's nothing else I'd want at all

What you want-a, I could be-a, I would go anywhere for you
If you need me I'll be here, yeah, no matter what you do

No I wouldn't change for nobody
But you're something new so I'll look your way
We're going round and round but you know we ain't wasting time
I will go the distance, baby, day or night

What you want-a, I could be-a, I would go, I would go for you
I'll be here, yeah, no matter what you do

What you want-a, I could be-a, I would go anywhere for you
If you need me I'll be here, yeah, no matter what you do

What you want-a, I could be-a, I would go anywhere for you
If you need me I'll be here, yeah, no matter what you do
