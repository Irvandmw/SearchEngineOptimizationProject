Lyrics:


Dark eyes on a dangerous face you are a beautiful killer
We pass by the same old place you are a (beautiful killer)
You donât have a life, you have blood on your hands
You can sleep at night and I donât understand
I donât know much about you are a wanted man

You can call my name and Iâll be a around
Maybe Iâll let you shoot me down
Cause youâre a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you wonât leave a trace

Do you know the reasons why you are a beautiful killer?
Hurt yourself but you never die, you are a (beautiful killer)
I like your silhouette when you stand on the streets
Like a samurai you can handle the heat
Makes me wanna pray for a haunted man

You can call my name and Iâll be a around
Maybe Iâll let you shoot me down
Cause youâre a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you wonât leave a trace

Canât really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe thatâs what you been dreaming about
Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

(Beautiful killer)

You changed the past
Good guys always finish last
What happens now?
I need to know how the story goes
Are we together?
I love you forever

You can call my name and Iâll be around
Maybe Iâll let you shoot me down
You can call my name and Iâll be around
Maybe Iâll let you shoot me down
Cause youâre a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you wonât leave a trace

Canât really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe thatâs what you been dreaming about
Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

Youâre a beautiful killer, but youâll never be Alain Delon
