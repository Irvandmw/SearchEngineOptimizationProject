Lyrics:


Jerry says that anytime
I think I have a good idea,
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel.
And thatâs because I have a bad mind,
And I have gold in my veins.
But he says I got the purest heart
That heâs ever seen, oh.

What God give me a brain for?
He wonât help me use it.
What God give me a plan for,
If he wonât help me do it?

Youâre gonna love me,
Iâm gonna make you.
Youâre gonna love me,
Iâm gonna make you.

Well I can tell that youâre the type 
To never trust a beauty queen.
But I was never voted for nothing, 
And high school never meaned
Anything to anybody,
Never ever gave myself away.
But even when Iâm funny,
You think Iâm acting, so I say:

What God give me a brain for,
If he wonât let me use it?
Whatâd God give me a plan for?
He never helps me do it.

Youâre gonna love me,
Iâm gonna have to make you.
Youâre gonna love me,
Iâm gonna make you.

You say that you donât want to be hypnotized,
But baby I, I donât want to hypnotize you.
Thereâs nothing from you that I want to take.
I just want to be like you.
(Maybe love you just a little bit),
Please. Oh, oh, oh

Jim, I dedicate this whole album to you.
You told me to get my way,
Thatâs exactly what Iâm gonna do.

Iâm going to strike out, right now.
Iâm striking out right now with this song.
But I canât help myself;
I canât do right for long,
You know that.

What God give me a brain for?
He knows that I can't use it.
I don't know why he'd give me a plan for,
He never lets me do it.

But you're gonna love me,
I'm gonna make you.
You gonna love me,
I'm gonna make you.
