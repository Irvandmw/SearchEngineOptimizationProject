Lyrics:


Young and foolish
Why is it wrong to be
Young and foolish
We haven't long to be
Soon enough the carefree days
The sunlit days go by
Soon enough the bluebird has to fly

We were foolish
One day we fell in love
Now we wonder
What were we dreamin' of
Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were young and foolish again

Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were young and foolish again
