Lyrics:


Cloudy every morning
Sun don't never shine
Cloudy every morning
Sun don't ever shine
Since I lost my baby
I been losing my mind
I thought this was a warm place
I must be in the wrong place
Thought this was a warm place
I must be in the wrong place
And I don't know where I'm going
Since my lover left me
Never no smile on my face
I am he is you are he is you are me and we are all together, woah woah
Buddy, this ain't LA
I've travelled such a long way
Buddy, this ain't LA
I've travelled such a long way
And I still don't know where I'm going
But without my baby
I better not stay
I better not stay, no ow woah no
