Lyrics:


We gather tonight for a celebration
Under the flag of a no-shoes nation
Speakin' our gospel, seekin' our truth
Brothers in arms, and sisters in cowboy boots
(Who gets to live like we do?)
Raisin' the roof
(Who gets to live like we do?)

We come down from the mountains, come up from the coast
We're all comin' out of some kinda comatose
Fill up our cups with a little bit of freedom
Come on, hold 'em up, everybody, let me see 'em

Yeah, we laugh and we love
And we can't get enough
As loud as we're livin', man
We still turn it up
We're amplified, come alive
Side by side
No matter where it goes
You know we're here for the ride

Who gets to roll like we do? (we do)
Yeah, who wants to rock like we do? (we do)
Yeah, who ain't gonna stop, man, no matter what?
Who gets to live like we do? (we do)

We drag this circus from town to town
Full of jesters, and jokers, and vibe room clowns
To your parkin' lot parties full of pirates like us
And we all come together when the curtain comes up

Yeah, we laugh and we love
And we can't get enough
As loud as we're livin', man
We still turn it up
We're amplified, come alive
Side by side
No matter where it goes
You know we're here for the ride

Who gets to roll like we do? (we do)
Yeah, who wants to rock like we do? (we do)
Yeah, who ain't gonna stop, man, no matter what?
Who gets to live like we do? (we do)

Not really sure who's liftin' up who
You came to see us
We came to see you, too
Yeah, it's true

And who gets as high as we do? (we do)
Who touches the sky like we do? (we do)

Yeah, we laugh and we love
And we can't get enough
As loud as we're livin', man
We still turn it up
We're amplified, come alive
Side by side
No matter where it goes
You know we're here for the ride

Who gets to roll like we do? (we do)
Yeah, who wants to rock like we do? (we do)
Yeah, who ain't gonna stop, man, no matter what?
Who gets to live like we do? (we do)
