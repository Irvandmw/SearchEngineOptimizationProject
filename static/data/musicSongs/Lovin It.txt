Lyrics:


It's the rascals

Baby don't you know you got all my love, all my love
Baby don't you know you got all my love, all my love

Hold up, wait
Before you go just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little

See what you don't understand
Is falling in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush
I call you my man
Doubt that I'd ever fall in love
Ever fall in love again

'Cause you give me chills
Every time we chill
I spend all of my days doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' you
Nothin' but lovin' you baby
(Boy you got all my time)
I'm lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection
All my attention
You don't gotta question
If I'm really
Lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)

Hold up, wait
Shut up and kiss me, babe
I just wanna get a little taste
I just wanna get a little taste before you go

See what you don't understand
Is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush
I call you my man
Doubt that I'd ever fall in love
Ever fall in love again

'Cause you give me chills
Every time we chill
I spend all of my days doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' you
Nothin' but lovin' you baby
(Boy you got all my time)
I'm lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection
All my attention
You don't gotta question
If I'm really
Lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)

Saving my trust
Don't mess this up
(You got me fallin' in love
You got me fallin' love
You got me fallin' so hard)
Boy you change the way I breathe
When you put your lips on me
I adore you
So let me make it clear to you that boy you're all I need
My baby

Nothin' but lovin' you
Nothin' but loving you baby
(Boy you got all my time)
I'm lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection
All my attention
You don't gotta question
If I'm really
Lovin' your lovin'
I'm lovin' it, lovin' it baby

Baby don't you know you got all my love, all my love
Baby don't you know you got all my love, all my love
