Song Name: The End Of Everything
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Everyone you love is gonna die
But, darlin', so is everything, don't cry
The stars will blink out one by one in time
And everyone you love is gonna die
Everything you fear is gonna end
All your hate and hurt lost to the wind
And it's hard, I know the universe can be a jealous friend
But everything you fear is gonna end

And there might not be a sadder thing
Than watchin' Saturn lose her rings
And black holes slowly dancin' in the dark
It's a song that they were born to sing
About the end of everything
Until it all goes up in one last spark

Everyone you love is gonna die
But so is everything so wipe your eyes
You know nothin' lasts forever, but Lord, we try
Everyone you love is gonna die

All the saints and sinners are the same
We're blessed then we obliterate
And that's how it was written from the start
It's a song that we were born to sing
About the end of everything
Until it all goes up in one last spark

Everyone you love is gonna die
So don't you let the moment pass you by
And man, there really ain't no sadder thing
There really ain't no sweeter thing
