Lyrics:


There we met and there we parted
By the lovely river Seine
Two young lovers broken hearted
For we knew we'd loved in vain
And though years may go
Some day I know
She'll come to Paris again
And I'll find her where I lost her
By the lovely river Seine

There we met and there we parted
By the lovely river Seine
Two young lovers broken hearted
For we knew we'd loved in vain
And though years may go
Some day I know
She'll come to Paris again
And I'll find her where I lost her
By the lovely river Seine
