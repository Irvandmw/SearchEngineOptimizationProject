Lyrics:


In the history of a life takes a heart
When the power of love comes together
There is nothing can tear us apart
And the touch of your hand I can feel
That what we got is stronger than steel
That's when you hear
My lover's prayer
It's my own silent message to you
Takes me there, my lover's prayer
And my soul is divided in two
With my love on the line
I send it all over the world
Out on the air, cause I can't let go
And my heart has a mind of it's own
It's my lover's prayer
It's the mystery of a place blessed by us
And the moment of truth is forever
In the face of incredible odds
The look in your eyes tells me why
Let our words burn a sign in the sky
My lover's prayer
It's as easy as talking to you
All my life, having you there
In my own private vision come true
You're heaven on earth
You're the fire and all that I'm worth
And I can be strong, you hold the key
Don't say it's over, don't say it's over for me
My lover's prayer
It's as easy as talking to you
All my life having you there
In my own private vision come true
In my search for your love
I send it all over the world
It's all I can bare and the nights get long
But my heart holds on, it's no empty words
It's my own silent message to you
Takes me there, my lover's prayer
And my soul is divided in two
Cause I can't let go
And my heart has a mind of it's own
It's my lover's prayer
