Lyrics:


Here we all work, on one jar or another
Why should I work while he rolls blaze?
I get tired, so tired and weary
Got to keep tolling day by day

Olâ man river, olâ man river
He donât say nothinâ, but he must know somethinâ
Olâ man river keeps on rollinâ along, ah ah

No, he donât plant cotton, he donât plant taters
Them what plants âem is soon forgotten
Olâ man river keeps on rollinâ along

Well, you and me, we sweat and strain
Our bodies all achinâ and wracked with pain
Tote that barge, you better lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

I get weary, so sick of tryinâ
Iâm tired of livinâ, but afraid of dyinâ
Olâ man river, he keeps on rollinâ along

Well, you, you and me, we sweat and strain
Our bodies all achinâ and wracked with pain
Oh, tote that barge, you better lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

I get weary, so sick of tryinâ
Tired of livinâ, but afraid of dyinâ
Olâ man river, he keeps on rollinâ along
Olâ man river keeps on rollinâ along, yeah
Olâ man river keeps on rollinâ along
