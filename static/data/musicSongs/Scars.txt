Lyrics:


I will surrender no more
To the wicked dreams that wake me
I got to let it all go
Not gonna overtake me
An oasis in the sand
Cover for a wounded soldier
Everybody needs an open hand
Mine is empty, wont'cha

Help me, something about you tells me
You're one of my kind
I know where you are baby
Show me your scars maybe
I'll show you mine

I remember being late for school
Clap of thunder and it all went silent
Over in the corner like you
At a party for the uninvited
Stand up when they call your name
And the lonely's multiplying
No one can feel-a your pain
Nobody hears you cryin'

Help me, something about you tells me
You're one of my kind
I know where you are baby
Show me your scars maybe
I'll show you mine

Help me, something about you tells me
You're one of my kind
I know where you are baby
Show me your scars maybe
I'll show you mine
