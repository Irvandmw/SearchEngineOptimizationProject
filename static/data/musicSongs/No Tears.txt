Lyrics:


Say they like me better when I'm talkinâ my shit
You know that, get lost with your bitch
Got gloss on her lips, there's gloss on my dick
Wipe it off and watch all that spit
Bitch, I'm a pretty boy like Belaire
Still, like a bitch with red hair
But only if she bad though, âcause I done got boujee
And any nigga, touch me, catch a body like Boosie
Try me, I'm shootin'
No back and forth just up it, I'm blowin'
Say my prayers and grab my iron when I wake up in the mornin'

And I ain't got no time to worry 'bout your feelings now Iâm worth a millâ
Through the fake shit, I stayed down, stayed on my grind and I'm still here
When I think about the times that they was lyinâ and I was real
Wanna cry but ain't no tears, wanna cry but ain't no tears
And I ain't got no time to worry âbout your feelings now I'm worth a mill'
Through the fake shit, I stayed down, stayed on my grind and I'm still here
When I think about the times that they was lyin' and I was real
Wanna cry but ain't no tears, wanna cry but ain't no tears

I done been through enough pain to understand that pain real
Why did I [?] Pain pills
I held it down through the pain
You ain't held for me cause you ain't here
I held it down in the rain
I got all this shit by my lonely
Remember I lost everything
Just try to make everyone happy
Breakin' the bread with the family (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder who wanna see me happy
Had a dream imma hop out a G Wagon
I work my move I'm doing me
I keep my cool I'm cool with me
Fuck them chains and jewelry
Feel the same if you was me (Yeah)

And I ain't got no time to worry 'bout your feelings now I'm worth a mill'
Through the fake shit, I stayed down, stayed on my grind and I'm still here
When I think about the times that they was lyin' and I was real
Wanna cry but ain't no tears, wanna cry but ain't no tears
And I ain't got no time to worry 'bout your feelings now I'm worth a mill'
Through the fake shit, I stayed down, stayed on my grind and I'm still here
When I think about the times that they was lyin' and I was real
Wanna cry but ain't no tears, wanna cry but ain't no tears

You just a muhfuckin' hater
I'm chasin' muhfuckin' cake
I had to pick up some paper
I just got some head at the bank
They askin' me how do I want it
I told 'em all fifties and hundreds
The plug said he gon' get it low
And give it to me and my brother
So, I went and bought a new phone
And I told the nigga to run it
And they picked him up on a Wednesday
And he was gon order it Sunday
You know the way that it go
Still, make a play on a 'bow
You don't wanna stay you can go
That's what I say to a hoe

And I ain't got no time to worry 'bout your feelings now I'm worth a mill'
Through the fake shit, I stayed down, stayed on my grind and I'm still here
When I think about the times that they was lyin' and I was real
Wanna cry but ain't no tears, wanna cry but ain't no tears
And I ain't got no time to worry 'bout your feelings now I'm worth a mill'
Through the fake shit, I stayed down, stayed on my grind and I'm still here
When I think about the times that they was lyin' and I was real
Wanna cry but ain't no tears, wanna cry but ain't no tears
