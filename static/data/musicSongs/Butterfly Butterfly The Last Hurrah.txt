Lyrics:


Butterfly, butterfly
Flying into the wind
You can be sure of it
That's no place to begin

Overthinking every little thing
Acknowledge the bell you can't unring

Tommorow there will come a time in the morning
You will find a way to begin

Butterfly, butterfly
Flutter into the skies
Butterfly, butterfly
Their molecular cries

Chrysalis dreams waiting on the fifth in-star
These stained glass wings can only take you so far

There will come a time in the morning
There will be a sight from within
Staying with a thick and thin
Butterfly, begin

Butterfly

Tommorow there will be a sight from within
Staying with a flew thick and thin
Butterfly, begin
Butterfly, begin

Butterfly
Butterfly
Butterfly
Butterfly...
