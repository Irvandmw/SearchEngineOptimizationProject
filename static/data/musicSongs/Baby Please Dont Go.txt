Lyrics:


Come here baby, hold me close
You've been gone so long
I've been waiting, endless nights
Days go on and on

Honey, I miss you
And I've been so lonely
I know that I promised, I wouldn't

But I've been crying, oh
I've been crying, oh
Baby, please don't go

I've been working so hard
Since we said goodbye
Now you're with me, now you're here
To kiss away these tears from my eyes

Baby, I need you
Walking beside me
I know that I promised, I wouldn't

But I've been crying, oh
I've been crying, oh
Baby, please don't go, no

Honey, I miss you
And I've been so lonely
I know I promised, I wouldn't

But I've been crying, oh
I've been crying
Baby, please don't go
