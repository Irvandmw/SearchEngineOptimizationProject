Lyrics:


I can give you what you want now if you still want what I could give
I can give the love you want now your love is all I need to live
I can give you what you want now lonesliness has made me see
I can give you what you want now if love is all you need from me

I tried to get the things I wanted but I wanted them for you
When all you ever really needed was a simple I love you
If you can tell me that you love me and mean it like you used to do
I can give you what you want now I can make your dreams come true

I can give you what you want now loneliness has made me see
I can give you what you want now if you dtill want to see from me
(I can give you what you want now)
