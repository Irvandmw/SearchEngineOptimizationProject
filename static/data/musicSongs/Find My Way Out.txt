Lyrics:


No, no
HoodCelebrityy

When your back's against the wall, you can't trust no one at all
In a world full of evil, you know they pray for you to fall
When I'm gone tell my story, have it written on the wall
I will get the story, a real hood story

Gotta find my way out
Please hold on tight to me
Gotta find my way out
Claim fake promise to me
Gotta find my way out
I gotta find the way out
Gotta find my way out

But these streets don't love you
But I gotta find my way out, makin' love to money now
And they tell you "stay humble"
But I gotta find my way out trapped in the dark now
It's like my whole life crumble
But I gotta find way out, the streets don't love you
Just tryna find my way

Gotta find my way out
Please hold on tight to me
Gotta find my way out
Claim fake promise to me
I gotta find a way out
I gotta find a way out
Gotta find my way out

Mama prayin' for me, prayin' for me
Every night me go to bed, mama pray for me
These streets don't love me
So every night me go to bed, me tellin' mama pray for me, pray for me
But I gotta find a way out
Seem like it's no way out
'Cause everytime I'm turnin'
Every bridge get burnin'

Gotta find my way out
Please hold on tight to me
Gotta find my way out
Claim fake promise to me
I gotta find a way out
I gotta find a way out
Gotta find my way out

Please hold on tight to me
Gotta find my way out
Claim fake promise to me
I gotta find my way out
I gotta find my way out
Gotta find my way out
