Lyrics:


Hello chump change Romeo
Watch this small town Cassanova work his show
And he's just a gigolo

Times are tough that's what the TV says
Romeo you know, he still works out okay, yeah
He puts on the trousers, oh so tight
Then he goes out searchin' for women in the night

Hello chump change Romeo
Watch this small town Cassanova work his show
And he's just a gigolo

And the ladies give out all they've got
Romeo you know, he's got to have a lot, yeah
And he knows just when and where and what to touch
And he knows that you never can touch to much

Hello chump change Romeo
Watch this small town Cassanova work his show
And he's just a gigolo
Just a chump change Romeo

He's changed his chump
But he never stays in a slump
And his mind's on fire
And it's burnin' up with desire

He's just a chump, change Romeo
He's just a chump, change Romeo
He's just a chump, change Romeo
