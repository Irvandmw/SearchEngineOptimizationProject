Lyrics:


Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Little inflated Bahamas shades, oops
Bright as the sun (Sun, sun, sun)
But you can copy the rest, I'm the best
I'm already the one (One, one, one)
You're down, you're down
Let the paramedics sweep you away, away
Medicated so I can't feel my face, my face
Brain rattlin' but check out my Js (Js, Js, Js)

You ain't a man and your girl my biggest fan
And she wanna see me stand up
Your girl, she wanna get stuck
Here the plan, I'ma take her by the hands
And show her how it feel again
And gettin' fast, gettin' fast, oh-oh-oh

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Singa, singa, singa
She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(Sit your ass down)
She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(Sit your ass down)
Singa

Lookin' at your booty, so amazed
Where did you get it from?
I got that gold records, double XL
You want my water gun
Can I wear it out, it out?
Let's be frank about it, I want it now, it now
Bring more shots and get you back to the house
I know you want it, girl, what you talkin' 'bout?
Hey, hey

You ain't a man and your girl my biggest fan
And she wanna see me stand up
Your girl, she wanna get stuck
Here the plan, I'ma take her by the hands
And show her how it feel again
And gettin' fast, gettin' fast, oh-oh-oh

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
'Cause she, 'cause she, she don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Singa, singa, singa (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause she don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, you better sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(You better sit your ass down, you better)
She don't want no rapper, want a singa (Hey)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, hey, sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(Sit your ass down)
Singa
(Get it, yeah)
She don't want no rapper, want aâ

Look at Breeze (Yeah), Polo V (Yeah)
Enzo shiny, you don't notice me (Uh)
Endos, nah, I don't blow no trees
And my gas tank full so I ain't on E
She wanna roll with a star
I think it's 'bout time I let it go that far
'Cause I already know when I can win that heart
'Cause she keep her booty bouncin' like a bungee cord
Or, never no trampoline
'Cause all the good girls comin' come with me
Hold up, wait, stop
Ayy, I like your face
But I don't see that when you move your waist
Come on, lil' mama, let me take his place
And the other dude's lame, he's a frosted flake
When singers come around, we shut 'em down
That's just the way it goes

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Singa, singa, singa
She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(Sit your ass down)
She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(Sit your ass down)
Singa
