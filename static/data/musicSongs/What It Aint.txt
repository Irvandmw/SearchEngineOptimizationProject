Lyrics:


I have been around
This old block before
I've walked into abruptly closign doors
Schooled in hard knocks, I've learned alot
'Bout how a heart can brake
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It aint layin' in the dark and wonderin' why she hasnt called
And now it's 2 am
It ain't driving by her house to find her wrapped up in the arms of you ex-best friend
It ain't bold face lies or alibies that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

You say you could
Show me how to love
Baby there's one thing 
You can be sure of
I wouldn't treat you wrong cause I've been on
The hurting side of pain
I might not know what love is but I know what it aint

It ain't showing up for dinner with a rose and chardonnay
Then drinkin by yourself
It ain't a postcard from Hawaii sayin' we can still be friends
But I met someone else
It ain't bold face lies or alibies that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It ain't a mink coat, forty pairs of shoes, two 14 karet anklets on my mastercard
It ain't walkin in a pawn shop, recognizing her engagement ring she swore she lost
It ain't bold face lies or alibies that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

If you had all day I could tell you things
That would make a grown man faint
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
Yeah I know what it ain't
