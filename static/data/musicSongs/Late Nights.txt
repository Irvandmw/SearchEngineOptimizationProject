Lyrics:


Baby can I get to know ya? say
Baby can I get to know ya? say
Baby can I get to know ya? yea
Late nights, late nights
Late nights, late nights yea

Late nights juggin' on the low, nigga
I swear I got it for the low, nigga
Big bro [?] he on low, nigga
We each got a piece and she knows, nigga
Now we got it to the function
Met a fine bitch that was [?]
I be really going back on my bullshit
Y'all nigga back, you don't know shit
Now I'm really drippin' off da ocean
And a young gotta put in motion
I know, you niggas way below
I know, this some late nights for sure
Aye, yah

Baby can I get to know ya? say
Baby can I get to know ya? say
Baby can I get to know ya? yea
Late nights, late nights
Late nights, late nights yea

Y'all nigga pretty [?], I won't remember you
But text me in the morning, so I won't forget 'bout you
Cause we roll a Back and we hit it to the face
After 5 minutes start to feel a lil lazy
Room full of smoke, Lil's hella hazy
Dazed and confused
[?]
Really turned up, whole crew lawty dawty, ya
Look to the left, see a big booty bouncin'
Look to the right, whole party still bouncin'
Tryin' to find the plug, nigga who bout' the action, ya
Baby keep me up, roll up, we can just chill baby we ain't gotta fuck

Baby can I get to know ya? say
Baby can I get to know ya? say
Baby can I get to know ya? yea
Late nights, late nights
Late nights, late nights yea
