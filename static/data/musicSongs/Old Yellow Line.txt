Lyrics:


Well I've been on the road for such a long, long time
I go where it leads me, this old thumb of mine
Since you said goodbye I've almost lost my mind
And all I do is follow that old yellow line

Old yellow line
Going 'round the bend
Old yellow line
Will you never, never end

Down the road I see a little hot dog stand
Lots of happy people who won't understand
How I got this sorrow in these eyes of mine
And why I must follow that old yellow line

Old yellow line
Going 'round the bend
Old yellow line
Will you never, never end

Well I'll probably spend the night on some old foreign floor
Let the wine cloud my mind so I can't see her face anymore

Maybe somewhere down the line I'll stop and then
I'll find someone who wants me and I'll love again
When I do she'll never leave me
Until that day I'll follow that old yellow line

Old yellow line
Going 'round the bend
Old yellow line
Will you never, never end

Old yellow line
Going 'round the bend
Old yellow line
Will you never, never end
