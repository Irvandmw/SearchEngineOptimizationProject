Lyrics:


Please give it up for my incredible, incredible crew on this stage
My female dancers
Give it up now
Come on, ladies
Give it up for my male dancers
Please give it up for Larry and Laurenne, they're twins
Please give it up for my incredible background singers
Please give it up for my beautiful orchestra
Please give it up for my drum line
Please give it up for my crew
That is everyone behind the scenes
That work tirelessly, tirelessly to put this show together
We love you
Thank you to my family that's here tonight
Have a beautiful night
I love you from the bottom of my heart
God bless you
Goodnight
Peace
