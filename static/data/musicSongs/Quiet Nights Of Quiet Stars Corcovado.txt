Lyrics:


Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar 
Floating on the silence that surrounds us 
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams 
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together 

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie 
Away... from all the earthly cares around us 
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it 
And all at once the happiness I knew,  
Became these quiet nights of loving you! 

[instrumental break]

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie 
Away . . . from all the earthly cares around us 
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it 
And all at once the happiness I knew,  
Became these quiet nights of loving you!
