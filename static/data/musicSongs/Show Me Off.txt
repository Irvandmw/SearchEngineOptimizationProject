Lyrics:


Hey, mmm, ah

I can't remember last time we went out
And I get that this ain't what love's all about
But I need attention every once in a while
I'm ready now, yeah, yeah

This love used to be royal like Will and Kate
And now I gotta beg you for another date
It ain't cute the way you make me wait
You better think straight when I say

You turn me on like crazy
Gotta show me, show me off
Don't you dare be lazy
Gotta show me, show me off
Boy you know I love to get dolled up
When you see me you get star-struck
Turn me on like crazy
Boy you better show me, show me, show me off
Cause I work it, work it like a boss
You gotta show me, show me, show me off
Oh, oh, show me off tonight
Yeah that's it

I don't need money, you can't buy my love
Don't question me honey, you're more than enough
Sometimes a girl just needs a night on the town
And I'm ready now, yeah, yeah

Yeah, we were sweet like Justin and Selena
We could still be like that, I ain't a dreamer
It ain't cute the way you make me wait
You better think straight when I say

You turn me on like crazy
Gotta show me, show me off
Don't you dare be lazy
Gotta show me, show me off
Boy you know I love to get dolled up
When you see me you get star-struck
Turn me on like crazy
Boy you better show me, show me, show me off
Cause I work it, work it like a boss
You gotta show me, show me, show me off
Oh, oh, show me off tonight

This love used to be royal like Will and Kate
And now I gotta beg you for another date
It ain't cute the way you make me wait
You better think straight when I say

You turn me on like crazy
Gotta show me, show me off
Don't you dare be lazy
Gotta show me, show me off
Boy you know I love to get dolled up
When you see me you get star-struck
Turn me on like crazy
Boy you better show me, show me, show me off
Cause I work it, work it like a boss
You gotta show me, show me, show me off
Oh, oh, show me off tonight
Yeah that's it
