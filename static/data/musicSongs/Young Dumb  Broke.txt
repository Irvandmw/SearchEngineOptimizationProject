Lyrics:


[Elton John:]
So you're just thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Elton John & Khalid:]
While we're young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yadada dadada dada
Yadada dadada da
Yadada dadada dada
Young, dumb, broke, high school kids

[Elton John:]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong, but
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

While we're young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yadada dadada dada
Yadada dadada da
Yadada dadada dada
Young, dumb, broke high school kids

Jump and we think - do it all in the game of love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Whoa...

I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Elton John & Khalid:]
While we're young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yadada dadada dada
Yadada dadada dada
Yadada dadada dada
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yadada dadada dada
Yadada dadada da
Yadada dadada dada
Young, dumb, broke high school kids

Yeah... whoa...
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
