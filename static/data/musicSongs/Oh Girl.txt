Lyrics:


Oh girl
I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
I just don't know how
Oh girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you will always be

All my friends call me a fool
They say
Let the woman take care of you
So I
Try to be hip
And think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now

Oh girl
Tell me what am I gonna do?
I know I've got a guilty face
Girl I feel so out of place
Oh yeah

Don't know where to go
Who to see, yeah

All my friends call me a fool
They say
Let the woman take care of you
So I
Try to be hip
And think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now

Oh girl
I guess I better go
I can set myself like I used to see
Girl I gotta get away from here
Oh girl
Will it double if you leave me now
I don't know where to look for love
And I don't, I don't know how

Oh girl
What do I love you so?
