Lyrics:


One more day before you go
Weâll stay up late for one more show
Grab the keys weâre going out
Weâre leaving home and we wonât come back again
Weâre friends till the end
Weâll take on the world
We just donât care at all

I never wanted to believe that you could lie
That friends deceive
And here I stand Iâm still the same
I watched you change 
You wont come back

[Chorus]
I wonder what itâs like to be like you
(I wonder what itâs like to be like you)
To never really care how bad it hurts
(To never really care how bad it hurts)
So go ahead and lie and keep moving on
Itâs all about yourself and youâre never wrong
Iâll watch you crash and burn

The day is gone 
Itâs cold out
I walk alone as you fade out
I donât know why Iâm reaching out
And now I know you wont come back

[Chorus]

Do you remember the days?
Way back when we used to say
Nothing can change us
No one will stop us
Iâll never be like you

Iâll watch you crash and burn
Youâre never wrong and you keep moving on
[4x]
