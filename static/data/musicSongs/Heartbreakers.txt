Lyrics:


Jenny had the devil in her smile and a cross on her neck
First girl I ever saw smoke a cigarette
Becky had that back seat fever on those parking lot nights
Didn't know what we were doing, but I think we did it right

And I wonder, whatever happened to the heartbreakers?
To the dream chasers, to the renegades running this town?
Whatever happened to the born to runners?
To the "Let me get your number"?
Did they ever settle down?
Did they grow up and get old?
Do they have someone to hold?
I'll bet they're still beautiful
Whatever, whatever happened to the Saturday nights?
Under the carnival lights?
Knew how to kiss you goodbye
Whatever, whatever happened to the heartbreakers?

Summer worked at a bar, had the boardwalk on a string
She was hotter than a cherry bomb, living up to her name
We'd get drunk on the beach, catching lightning in a bottle
Wasn't thinking about much, wasn't worried about tomorrow

And I wonder, whatever happened to the heartbreakers?
To the dream chasers, to the renegades running this town?
Whatever happened to the born to runners?
To the "Let me get your number"?
Did they ever settle down?
Did they grow up and get old?
Do they have someone to hold?
I'll bet they're still beautiful
Whatever, whatever happened to the Saturday nights?
Under the carnival lights
Knew how to kiss you goodbye
Whatever, whatever happened to the heartbreakers?

You were lucky just to know 'em
If you got lucky, you got broken
You were never gonna hold 'em
Never gonna hold 'em

Whatever happened to the heartbreakers?
To the dream chasers?
To the renegades running this town?
Whatever happened to the born to runners?
To the "Let me get your number"?
Did they ever settle down?
Did they grow up and get old?
Do they have someone to hold?
I'll bet they're still beautiful
Whatever, whatever happened to the Saturday nights?
Under the carnival lights?
Knew how to kiss you goodbye
Whatever, whatever happened to the heartbreakers?
Whatever happened to the heartbreakers?
