Lyrics:


Magic is the moonlight
On this lover's June night
As I see the moonlight
Shining in your eyes.

And this is the power
In this moonlit hour
Love begin to flower
This is paradise.

Living in the splendor
Of your kiss so tender
Make my heart surrender
To your love divine.

Magic is the moonlight
More than any June night
Magic is the moonlight
For it made you mine...
