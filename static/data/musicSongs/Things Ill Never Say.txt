Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Iâm tugging at my hair
Iâm pulling at my clothes
Iâm trying to keep my cool
I know it shows
Iâm staring at my feet
My cheeks are turning red
Iâm searching for the words inside my head

[Pre-Chorus]
(Cause) Iâm feeling nervous
Trying to be so perfect
Cause I know youâre worth it
Youâre worth it
Yeah

[Chorus]
If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I wanna blow you... away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down
On one knee
Marry me today
Guess, Iâm wishing my life away
With these things Iâll never say

It donât do me any good
Itâs just a waste of time
What use is it to you
Whatâs on my mind
If it ainât coming out
Weâre not going anywhere
So why canât I just tell you that I care

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Whatâs wrong with my tongue
These words keep slipping away
I stutter, I stumble 
Like Iâve got nothing to say

[Pre-Chorus]

Guess Iâm wishing my life away with these things Iâll never say
If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I wanna blow you...away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down
On one knee
Marry me today
Guess, Iâm wishing my life away
With these things Iâll never say
These things Iâll never say
