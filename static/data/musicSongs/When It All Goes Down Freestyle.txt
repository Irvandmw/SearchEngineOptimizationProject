Lyrics:


It go down, It go down, It go down
It go down, It go down
It go down, It go down, It go down
It go down, It go down

When it all goes down, and the clips run out
I bet I make history
I bet I make history

When it all goes down, and the cops come round
That murderâs a mystery
That murderâs a mystery

[50 Cent - Verse 1:]
Itâs that gangsta shit, it sound stupid donât it
Feel like Fifty, Flocka and Gucci on it
Move grams of this, move Oâs of that
Move the muthafucking bricks, where the money at
Bitches scared huh, pussy, hold ya strength
When the beat pop off no controlling that
You wanâ call the cops
Run call the cops
Look nigga we donât care if they cominâ or not
Got the pump in the trunk, nigga biting a lot
One buck shot clear the whole block
Had this bitch taped off make it so hot
Nigga with a 12 gauge Iâm a sure shot
Call it shell shock when ya ass drop
Get it shakinâ like a muthafuckinâ rattle nigga
Go âhead fuckinâ with me and be a casualty
You think a nigga bullshittin, then come and see

When it all goes down, and the clips run out
I bet I make history
I bet I make history

When it all goes down, and the cops come round
That murderâs a mystery
That murderâs a mystery

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
Now while you waitinâ, all debatinâ
Shouldnât you niggas be retaliatinâ
We laughin bout it, you cryin damn
Hit ya muthafuckinâ homie when his gun jam
His chest red, his back red
Man, that nigga there damn near dead
He coughinâ, he weezinâ
Man that nigga finna stop breathinâ
His momma there, his daddy there
Hit him by the Escalade, get a caddy there
His shines on him, his dimes on him
Had hoes all in the club grindinâ on him
Niggas talkinâ bout it, keep talkinâ bout it
Cause they know nigga donât give a fuck
Quit talkinâ bout it, for you talkinâ bout it
When the muthafuckin pigs show up

When it all goes down, and the clips run out
I bet I make history
I bet I make history

When it all goes down, and the cops come round
That murderâs a mystery
That murderâs a mystery
