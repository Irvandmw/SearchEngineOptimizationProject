Lyrics:


Every day I get a little closer 
And everything I'm made of starts to melt away
I see the signs but I can't quite make the words out 
All I want is to be near you but I push you away 

I just wanna get away
But I hurt you every day 

The part that hurts the most
The part that hurts the most is me
The most is you
It's everything I do without you 

The part that hurts the most is me
The most is you
It's everything I do without you 

Every chance I get I'm moving closer 
I know I'm not supposed to but I can't break away 
I see the signs but I can't quite make the words out 
All I want is to be near you but I push you away 

I just wanna get away
But I hurt you every day 

The part that hurts the most 
The part that hurts the most is me 
The most is you 
It's everything I do without you 

The part that hurts the most is me 
The most is you 
It's everything I do without you 

I hate talking about it 
Try to lose it but instead I found it
I just want you to know
I couldn't love anyone more

No! Stay away from me, get up 
I'm tryna walk away, it just won't let up
No! Stay away from me, get up 
I'm tryna walk away, it just won't let up 

No! Stay away from me, get up 
I'm tryna walk away, it just won't let up 
No! Stay away from me, get up 
I'm tryna walk away, it just won't let up 

The part that hurts the most is me 
The most is you 
It's everything I do without you 

The part that hurts the most is me 
The most is you 
It's everything I do without you 

The part that hurts the most is me 
The most is you 
It's everything I do without you 

The part that hurts the most is me 
The most is you 
It's everything I do without you
