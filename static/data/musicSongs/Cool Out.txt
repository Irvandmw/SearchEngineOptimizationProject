Lyrics:


Just before I go
Yes I know that I'm losing control and
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control
I know I'm always pacin'
And I blame it on the pressure I'm facin'
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control

Standin' on your front porch, sayin' "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild, sayin' "Just go home and..."

Cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high
Stay fresh, play nice
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

Always sayin' that you read my sign and
Always wishin' that I'd take the time but
You know that's not my speed
Only believe what I can see
I live my life in black and white
I know that's not what you would like
But that's all I know
I put my mind in cruise control

Standin' on your front porch, sayin' "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild, sayin' "Just go home and..."

Cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high
Stay fresh, play nice
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

All the things that you detest in me
They keep you comin' back for more you see
We make each other get a bit crazy
But you will always be a part of me

Cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high
Stay fresh, play nice
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out
Cool out
So cool out
