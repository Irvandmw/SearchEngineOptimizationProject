Lyrics:


Shackled by the heavy burden
'Neath the load of guilt and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
(He touched me)
And now I am no longer the same

For He touched me, oh, He touched me
(He touched me)
And oh, what joy that floods my soul
(wonderful joy, wonderful joy that floods my soul)
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole

Oh, since I met this blessed Savior
And since he cleansed and made me whole
Oh, I will never cease, never cease to praise Him
(to praise Him)
I'll shout it while eternity rolls

Oh, He touched me, oh, He touched me
(He touched me)
And, oh, what a joy that floods my soul
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole
