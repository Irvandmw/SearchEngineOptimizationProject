Lyrics:


You said
This would never end
But I want you for more than just my friend
Yeah

And you said
This is hard to say
I never really looked at you that way

Getting scared, to tell you how I feel
It's not a passing thing, I know it's real

And if you have a reason
Not to move it on
So what about it baby

If you say no
I'll still be there

You keep running
I'm still falling
You don't know this
It's something new my hearts discovered

You keep running
I'll keep calling
Till you notice
You see friends, but I see lovers

You see friendship, I see love
You see friendship, I see love

Don't be scared
To let me in your heart
I've been there before
But I played a different part

And if you have a reason
Not to move it on
So what about it baby

If you say no
I'll still be there

You keep running
I'm still falling
You don't know this
It's something new my hearts discovered

You keep running
I'll keep calling
Till you notice
You see friends, but I see lovers

You see friendship, I see love
You see friendship, I see love

And if you have a reason
Not to move it on
So what about it baby

If you say no
I'll still be there

You keep running
I'm still falling
You don't know this
It's something new my hearts discovered

You keep running
I'll keep calling
Till you notice
You see friends, but I see lovers

Yeah, yeah, yeah

You want friendship, I want love

You want friendship, I want love
You want friendship, I want love
You want friendship, I want love
What is it I'm dreaming of?
