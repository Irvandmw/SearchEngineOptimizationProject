[Justin Bieber:]
Oh, ain't no such thing, as coincidence
Oh, ain't no such thing, as coincidence
Oh woah, ain't no such thing, as coincidence
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Never known July to be so cold
Never seen a green light, that meant the end of the road
Never had a place in my heart, couldn't call it your own
Ain't no coincidence

I ran into you on the other side of the world today
It's one in a billion
Looking at the TV and I ran across your face
Oh, what a feeling
What's the odds of us being from the same place
What's the chance of us both having the same taste
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh woah, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Never known my eyes used to be so red
Never had a night when I didn't toss and turn in my bed
And when we speak a word at the same time, are you in my head?
Ain't no coincidence, no woah

I ran into you on the other side of the world today
It's one in a billion
Looking at the TV and I ran across your face
Oh, what a feeling
What's the odds of us being from the same place
What's the chance of us both having the same taste
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh woah, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Poo Bear:]
One at a time, it feels so crazy then what am I?
I want your silhouette in my mind
Love's so angry but you're so kind
Oh I don't believe in accidents
I do believe in taking a guess in your innocence
We're meant to be together in every sense
Woah, woah, woah

[Justin Bieber:]
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh woah, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
