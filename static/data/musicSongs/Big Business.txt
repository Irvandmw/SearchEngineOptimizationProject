Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no (Baby)
No, no

Real nigga (Yeah), still livin' (Yeah), big business (Yeah), rich niggas (Yeah)
And it ain't nothin' that they can say could stop me, no
It ain't nothin' that they can say could stop me, no
A real nigga, still livin', big business, rich niggas
And it ain't nothin' that they can say could stop me, no
And it ain't nothin' that they can say could stop me, no

Okay, now I'm back in my zone (My zone)
Don't pick up my phone (My phone)
Bitches get me up (Up)
They like my cologne (They like my co-)
Niggas give me mud (Huh)
I be like, "what's wrong?" (I be like, what's)
Who passed me this blunt (What's that?)
Why this shit not strong?
I gotta stay with my beat (I gotta stay)
Won't let nobody play with my peeps (Oh you wanna play?)
Got me a AR receipt (I won't let 'em play)
And I bet I'ma hop out and squeeze it (Brr, brr)
All the hatin' it stoppin' my breathin' (Uh, yeah)
'Cause they still ain't gon' pop when they see me (Uh, yeah)

And it ain't nothin' that they can say could stop me, no
And it ain't nothin' that they can say could stop me, no

Let's go back in, okay now
Don't fuck up my vibe (Vibe)
Please don't blow my high (My high)
I'm not lookin' for love (No love)

You don't have to stare (You don't have to)
You can just say hi (You can just say)
She still acting shy (Why?)
She gon' fuck tonight
I'm not gon' play with' a ho (Play)
Ain't got nothin' to say to a ho (Nothin' to say)
And whatever I say it's a go (Whatever I say)
And I ain't finna say it no more (Ain't finna say)
And I ain't into savin' a ho (Ayy)
Only thing that I'm savin' is dough (Oh yeah)
