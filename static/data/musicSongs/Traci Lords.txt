Lyrics:


I told 'em pick up 'cause my favorite porn star is a white girl
She said she's going next, it's my turn
I might just give her that and shit you might learn
Some things you might learn

My favorite porn star is a big titty, bitch is jiggy
Sex super litty
She said if you hit it you can get it, just don't leave a hickey
I ain't ever talkin', never fucking talkin', beg your fuckin' pardon
Poppin' cause you know you got it, clappin' but you know you got it
Sin city, bitch is gritty, favorite rapper Biggie
Shawty bottle-poppin', product coppin' ballin' Michael Bivins
We ain't know you winning, poppin, ' overspending'
Gucci chokers over linen

White girl
She said she's going next, it's my turn
I might just give her that and shit you might learn
Some things you might learn
My favorite porn star is a white girl
She said she's going next it's my turn
I might just give her that and shit you might learn
Some things you might learn

My favorite porn star is a border man
Bet you thought you had it but she sorta had it
Fuck the [?] she threw it at me like she quarterbackin'
You're the one, tell them you're the one
I need muscles send me 40 to the 40 floor
And bring 'em, bring 'em all at once
Big titty, bitch is jiggy
Body just like Iggy, like I'm black on black on black
This time you'll forgive me
I ain't ever talking, never fucking talkin', beg your fuckin' pardon
Now I'm on my Cameron Diaz, Katy Perry, Dolly Parton
Life, you know the life
I told her pop it every night, that's good advice
I mean she's in love with the lights, she love the lights
I said, well do that, that's my spice, my fucking spice
My favorite one is a white girl
She said she's going next, it's my turn
I might just give her that and shit you might learn
Some things you might learn
My favorite porn star is a white girl

Oh, no
[?]
Baby you're a brand new weapon
[?]
Throw it back and let it happen
