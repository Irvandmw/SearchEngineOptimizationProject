Lyrics:


Here I stand (here I stand)
Look around around around around around
But you won't see me (but you won't see me)

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)

I'm just a

Just a new man
Yes you made me live again, wow

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Ooh, whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Ooh, don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just peaches and me

Don't I love her so
Yes she made me live again, yeah

Yeah, ooh,

A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so
Ooh don't I love him so

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory 
With you

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around around around around around around
Down in the city just a-you and me

Don't I love you so

Go, go, go, little queenie
