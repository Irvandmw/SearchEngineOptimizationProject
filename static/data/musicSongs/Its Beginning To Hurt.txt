Lyrics:


Everybody's been tellin' me, that you've been slippin' around
I just laugh, say they're wrong and kinda put them down
I thought that you were havin' fun and you just like to flirt
But now I'm startin' to wonder, 'cause baby it's beginning to hurt

Oh, I feel a pain, they're whisperin' your name
Yeah, I still love you, tell me it's not true

I can't believe that you could kiss me and make it seem so right
Then have a date with someone else on the very same night
If it's true, then baby you are treatin' me like dirt
But now I'm startin' to wonder, 'cause baby it's beginning to hurt

Oh, I feel a pain, they're whisperin' your name
Yeah, I still love you, tell me it's not true

Oh, I feel a pain, they're whisperin' your name
Yeah, I still love you, tell me it's not true
