Lyrics:


The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave but then
I just can't go on, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do, you win again

I'm sorry for your victim now
'Cause soon his head, like mine, will bow
He'll give his heart, but all in vain
And someday say, you win again
