Lyrics:


I had a vision and I watched it come alive
And now I'm wishin' that I had a bit more time
I have been achin' in my bones at night
Conversations with my bloodshot eyes
Hard to focus when the pressure makes you blind

All I wanted was to make some art, talk some shit
Didn't really care about getting rich
Now they make this hard
Tryna make me quit
Maybe for the thrill of it

Baby, hold me
Looking for a little bit of honesty
Take me, slowly
Give me just a little, baby, promise me
There's a hollow in my chest
And you can take whatever's left
Baby, maybe
You could give me just a little bit of honesty

I've been sleeping in a bed too big for me
Can't remember what's like to get some sleep
I've fallin' victim to a homesick life
Got a cravin' that I just can't buy
God, I wonder if I'll ever make it right

All I wanted was to make some art, talk some shit
Didn't really care about getting rich
Now they make this hard
Tryna make me quit
Maybe for the thrill of it

Baby, hold me
Looking for a little bit of honesty
Take me, slowly
Give me just a little, baby, promise me
There's a hollow in my chest
And you can take whatever's left
Baby, maybe
You could give me just a little bit of honesty

Give me now, give me now
Give me now, honesty now
Give me now, give me now
Give me now, honesty now
Give me now, give me now
Give me now, honesty now
Give me now, give me now
Give me now, honesty

Baby, hold me
Looking for a little bit of honesty
Take me, slowly
Give me just a little, baby, promise me
There's a hollow in my chest
And you can take whatever's left
Baby, maybe
You could give me just a little bit of honesty

Give me a just a little bit of honesty
