Lyrics:


Just so you know, just so you know, just
Girl I got you whipping
Got you so open, got you so open
I turn you on, I turn you on
Tell me now baby cause I ain't got no time to play
Come over here and put that shit right in my face

I turn you on like a light switch, every time you be excited
Every time you wanna ride it, baby just ride it
Baby no one is invited
Maybe your best friend invited, okay your girlfriend invited
I like it, I love it, she know that I am head honco
Better get over here baby, pronto
You said that you want that new condo
Girl I better love it
She popping non-stop, where her top go?
She hop in the drop and with tacos
In pronto I hit like the lotto
Girl I better love it
She coming over and baby I like it
She pour up tequila and she get excited
She want me to beat it up and I ain't gon' fight it
This shit is she get lighted
I'm hearing this chick when the night ends
She hang from the sofa, she cannot fight it
Got her rolling that dope up
Just waiting to light it

Tell me now baby cause I ain't got no time to play
Come over here and put that shit right in my face
Just so you know, just so you know, just
Girl I got you whipping
Got you so open, got you so open
I turn you on, I turn you on
Tell me now baby cause I ain't got no time to play
Come over here and put that shit right in my face

Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you, just so you know

I turn you on like a light switch, every time you be excited
Every time you wanna ride it, baby just ride it
Baby no one is invited
Maybe your best friend invited, okay your girlfriend invited
I like it, I love it, she know that I am head honco
Better get over here baby, pronto
You said that you want that new condo
Girl I better love it
She popping non-stop, where her top go?
She hop in the drop and with tacos
In pronto I hit like the lotto
Girl I better love it
She coming over and baby I like it
She pour up tequila and she get excited
She want me to beat it up and I ain't gon' fight it
This shit is she get lighted

I'm hearing this chick when the night ends
She hang from the sofa
