Lyrics:


Have you ever had one of those days
When you wake up feeling good
So good that you can take the whole world on
Or one of those days when you just know no matter what
Nothing in the world could go wrong

Well, that's the way I feel this morning
But, baby, I just gotta say
I always have one of those days

After one of those nights, just like last night
Oh, my, what a beautiful thing, just you and me
Those tangled sheets were wrapped around us
Baby, thanks to your love it was one of those nights
That leads to one of those days
That leads right to one of those nights

Have you ever had one of those smiles
You just can't wipe away the sweet anticipation's too strong
One of those smiles you wear all day
Cause you can taste the kiss of passion waiting back home

Well, that's the one I'm wearing right now
But, baby, you always leave one of those smiles on me

After one of those nights, just like last night
Oh, my, what a beautiful thing, just you and me
Those tangled sheets were wrapped around us
Baby, thanks to your love
It was one of those nights that leads to one of those days
That leads right to one of those nights

Oh, one of those nights, just like last night
Oh, my, what a beautiful thing, just you and me
Those tangled sheets were wrapped around us
Baby, thanks to your love it was one of those nights
One of those nights, just like last night
Oh, my, what a beautiful thing, just you and me
Those tangled sheets were wrapped around us
Baby, thanks to your love
It was one of those nights that leads to one of those days
That leads right to one of those nights
One of those nights
Oh, one of those nights, just like last night
Oh my what a beautiful thing, just you and me
Those tangled sheets were wrapped around us
Baby, thanks to your love
It was one of those nights, just like last night
Oh, my, what a beautiful thing, just you and me
Those tangled sheets were wrapped around us
Baby, thanks to your love it was one of those nights
