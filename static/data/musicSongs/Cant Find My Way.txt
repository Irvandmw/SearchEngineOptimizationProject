Lyrics:


'...To try to do the right thing...always the right thing.' 

I've been doing some thinking, here on my own
it's been on my mind
this debt I owe to you
I have to repay in kind

But I can't find my way

Tired and weary, I follow the path
that leads to your door
but it occurred to me, all that I have
is already yours

But I can't find my way

Oh, just to sit a while
Oh, just to sit and watch you smile

But I can't find my way

Keep the faith you say
to keep the faith I pray
be strong you say
just follow the light

Wheels keep turning but the close I get
the farther I seem
peace will only come
finding the peace within

But I can't find my way
