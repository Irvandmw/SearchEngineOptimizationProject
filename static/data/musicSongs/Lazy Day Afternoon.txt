Lyrics:


Nothing's going on, but I don't care
Leave me here, don't take me anywhere
Why should I get up when I've got nothing to do?
Just another lazy day afternoon

Beautiful day outside, but I don't care
Everything I need I got right here
Why should I go out? Why should I even move?
Just another lazy day afternoon

Afternoon, when everybody's workin'
I'd rather be a jerk and lay around
Afternoon, this day is just too perfect
Just another lazy day afternoon

Nothing's going on, but I don't care
Leave me here, don't take me anywhere
Why should I get up when I've got nothing to do?
Just another lazy day afternoon

Just another lazy day afternoon

Afternoon, when everybody's workin'
I'd rather be a jerk and lay around
Afternoon, this day is just too perfect
Just another lazy day afternoon

Beautiful day outside, but I don't care
Everything I need I got right here
Why should I go out? Why should I even move?
Just another lazy day afternoon
