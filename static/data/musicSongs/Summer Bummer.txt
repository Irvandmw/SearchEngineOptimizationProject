[Lana Del Rey:]
It's never too late
To be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
It's never too late
To leave if you wanna leave
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby
I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, mmm

[A$AP Rocky:]
Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it
But bang it like my fingers
She pray to God I made it
But bankin' like my Franklins
My neighbors stopped the hatin'
What?
Huh?
Slide inside it
Diddy Boppin'
Milly Rockin'
She just might become my lover for real
I might fuck with her all summer for real
They better not holla if I cuff her for real
Niggas better run for cover for real
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real
Truthfully between you and me I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

[Lana Del Rey:]
Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, mmm

White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks
Just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In making me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lie and black beaches

High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Don't be a bummer
Don't be a bummer

Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe
Don't be a bummer, babe
