Lyrics:


I pack my bags, I'm going away
I'm only leaving for a day
It's nice to have some time alone
And it's nice to know how I miss home
I wrote this song to let you know

I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you give meaning to the words "I love you"
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you are who I love to say those words to

You're always with me in my head
I take you with me in my heart
It's better when I'm in your bed
It's better when we're not apart
I just can't do this alone

I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you give meaning to the words "I love you"
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you are who I love to say those words to

Yeah, live's about the people who surround you
Love's the only thing it all comes down to
I just want you to know

I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you give meaning to the words "I love you"
I'm better with you
I'm better because you are who I love to say those words to
You-hoo...you-hoo-hoo-hoo...
