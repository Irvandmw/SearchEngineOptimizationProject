Lyrics:


I put the papers on your doorstep
The keys under the mat
Although the lawyer said to mail you
I'm still not over yet

There's so much I wanna tell you
But I really need to forget
Even though we're not together

Girl I will miss you (oh boy I will miss you)
Even though you broke my heart
I will miss you (I'm gonna miss you)
Cause I'll always love you, love you (always love you)
Forever think of you, of you (of you)
And I'll always want you, want you (always want you)
Forever think of you, of you (think of you)

Although we're apart
You still own my heart
Forever, and ever
And ever

I never liked the sound of single
It don't sound good to me
Tell me how I'm suppose to mingle
When you're all I wanna see

There's so much I want to tell you
But I really need to forget
Even though we're not together

Girl I will miss you (oh boy I will miss you)
Even though you broke my heart
I will miss you (I'm gonna miss you)
Cause I'll always love you, love you (always love you)
Forever think of you, of you (of you)
And I'll always want you, want you (always want you)
Forever think of you, of you (think of you)

Although we're apart
You still own my heart
Forever, and ever
And ever

Cause I'll always love you, love you (always love you)
Forever think of you, of you (of you)
And I'll always want you, want you (always want you)
Forever think of you, of you (think of you)

Although we're apart
You still own my heart
Forever, and ever
And ever
