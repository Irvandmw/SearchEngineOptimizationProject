Lyrics:


She's got legs, she knows how to use them
She never begs, she knows how to choose them
She's holding legs, you wonder how to feel them
Would you get behind them if you could only find them?

She's my baby, she's my baby, yeah, it's alright

She's got hair down to her fanny
She's got a thread[?] skirt right up to her panties
Every time she's dancin', she knows what to do
Everybody wants to see, see if she can use it

She's so fine, she's all mine, ooh girl, you got it right

She's got legs, she knows how to use them
She never begs, she knows how to choose them
She's got a dime all of the time
Stays out at night movin' through time

Ooh, I want her, yeah, I got to have her
Ooh, the girl is alright
The girl is alright
Yeah, she's alright
