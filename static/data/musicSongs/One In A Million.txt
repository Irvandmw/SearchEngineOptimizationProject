Lyrics:


(One in a, one in a, one in a)
(One in a, one in a, one in a)
(One in a, one in a, one in a)
(One in a, one in a, one in a)

You say don't worry about me babe
Promise this is just a phase (so what?)
Should I stand around and wait
While you're living in a haze? (nuh-uh)
I remember how you were
When it all was fresh and new (and what?)
Now when you look at me
Sometime's like you're looking straight through

And I said: "why does it matter when you don't wanna fight it?"
Looking like lovers, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out, nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know

I'm one in a million (one in a, one in a, one in a)
I'm one in a million (one in a, one in a, one in a)
You're going down without me,
Wishing that you had someone like me
I'm one in a million (one in a, one in a, one in a)

You say, "Don't worry about us babe
I just need a little time" (so what?)
I'm supposed to be okay
When we're nowhere close to fine? (nuh-uh)
I know you've done nothing wrong
But it only makes it worse (you-ooh)
Hurt me more, you don't care
'Bout what you're about to lose

And I said: why does it matter when you don't wanna fight it?
Looking like lovers, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out, nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know

I'm one in a million (one in a, one in a, one in a)
I'm one in a million (one in a, one in a, one in a)
You're going down without me,
Wishing that you had someone like me
I'm one in a million (one in a, one in a, one in a)

And I said: why does it matter when you don't wanna fight it?
Looking like lovers, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out, nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know

I'm one in a million (one in a, one in a, one in a)
I'm one in a million (one in a, one in a, one in a)
You're going down without me,
Wishing that you had someone like me
I'm one in a million (one in a, one in a, one in a)
