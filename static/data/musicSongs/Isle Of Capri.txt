Lyrics:


It was on the Isle of Capri that I found her
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree
Oh, I can still see the flowers bloomin' 'round her
Where we met on the Isle of Capri

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning
But some how fate hadn't meant her for me
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning
Still, my heart's on the Isle of Capri

Summertime was nearly over, blue Italian sky above
I said, "Lady, I'm a rover, can you spare a sweet word of love?"

She whispered softly, "It's best not to linger"
And then as I kissed her hand, I could see
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger
It was goodbye at the Villa Capri

Summertime was nearly over, blue Italian sky above
I said, "Lady, I'm a rover, can you spare a fine word of love?"

She whispered softly, "It's best not to linger"
And then as I kissed her hand, I could see
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger
It was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
It was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
It was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
