Lyrics:


Shorty, what yo name is?

Uh uh
Them hustlers keep on talkin'
Uh uh
They like the way I'm walking
Uh uh
You're saying that you want B?
So press "Record", I'll let you film me

On your video phone
Make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone
I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone
On your video, video
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone

I love how you approach me
Fresh white, with your pants hangin' grown-man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore

Swag up, it's bright
One blade, it's tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby, you're doin' something right
You just canceled every other man here

You say you like my bag and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'mma leave my number on your video phone

Uh uh
I got no time for frontin'
Uh uh
I know just what I'm wanting
Uh uh
If it's gonna be you and me?
When I call they better see me on your video screen

Uh uh
Them hustlers keep on talkin'
Uh uh
They like the way I'm walking
Uh uh
You're saying that you want B?
So press "Record", I'll let you film me

On your video phone
Make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone
I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone
On your video, video
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone

You're a cutie
You should let me put you in my movies
Do shoot into a star of your own hit song
We can shoot the video right here on my cellphone

I never seen a smile so pretty
I need to know I'll always have you with me
So, take your picture on my video phone
You can pick your own song
And you could be the only one....

I know you like that
Turn you into a star? I got it like that, like that,
Baby, don't fight it
'Cause when I miss your call I hit you right back
On my video phone

Uh uh
Them hustlers keep on talkin'
Uh uh
They like the way I'm walking
Uh uh
You're saying that you want B?
So, press "Record", I'll let you film me

On your video phone
Make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone
I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone
On your video, video
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone

You know them Gs, they be hollerin'
'Specially them hot ones
Brooklyn, Atlanta, Houston to New Orleans
When they see me they be like, "Yo, B, let me call you!"
You breakin' my focus, boy
You cute and you ballin'

You like it when I shake it?
Shorty on a mission, what's your name is?
What? You want me naked?
If you liking this position you can tape it

On your video phone
Uh uh
Hustler keep on talkin'
Uh uh
You like the way it's popping?
Uh uh
You're saying that you want B?
Press "Record", baby, film me

On your video phone
Make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone
I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone
On your video, video
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone
