Lyrics:


Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I met her walkin' down an uptown street
She's so fine, you know I wish she was mine
I get shook up everytime we meet

Talking 'bout you
Nobody but you, oh I do mean you
I'm just tryin' to get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
You know now she looks so good
She's so fine ya know I wish she was mine
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

Talking 'bout you
Nobody but you, oh I do mean you
I'm just tryin' to get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
You know now she looks so fine
She's a honky-tonk queen, she's the love machine
Someday I'd like to make her mine

Talking 'bout you
Nobody but you, oh I do mean you
I'm just tryin' to get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
You know now she looks so good
She's so fine ya know I wish she was mine
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

Talking 'bout you
Nobody but you, oh I do mean you
I'm just tryin' to get a message to you
