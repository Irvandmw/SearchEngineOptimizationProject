Song Name: Balance Slays The Demon
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


(Deep in the ocean of darkness
In the mirror of light
Balance becomes a stranger
And in your fantasies
He rides a storm on your peace

Beyond the shadows he settled for more
There is a miracle illuminated)

Deep in the ocean of darkness
In the mirror of light
Balance becomes a stranger
And in your fantasies
He rides a storm on your peace
Wake up and smell the danger

Ever the light casts a shadow
Ever the night springs from the light

In the end, it's never just the light you need
When balance slays the demon, you'll find peace
In the end, it's never just the dark you seek
When balance slays the demon, you'll find peace
Find the peace!

(Beyond the lake he called home
Lies a deeper darker ocean green)

Like an evil twin, feel it scratching within
Like an insane sovereign ranger
And his beautiful face with his leathery lace
So can't you see the play he's staging?

Ever the light casts a shadow
Ever the night springs from the light

In the end, it's never just the light you need
When balance slays the demon, you'll find peace
In the end, it's never just the dark you seek
When balance slays the demon, you'll find peace
Find the peace!

([Reversed:] "It will happen again, in another town, called Ordinary")

In the end, it's never just the light you need
When balance slays the demon, you'll find peace
In the end, it's never just the dark you seek
When balance slays the demon, you'll find peace
Find the peace!

(Screaming, new darkness descends on this frail frame
I drown in fathomless black space, will I never scratch the depths of this domain?
I see not, yet nothing could be worse then the shades my mind calls herein
Alone, in my own wake the unraveling of reasons schemed)
