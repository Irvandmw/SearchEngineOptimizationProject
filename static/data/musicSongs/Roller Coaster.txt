Lyrics:


Today I got so mad at you, yeah
It's like I couldn't control myself
Girl, I was done, I was so through with you
But I know I couldn't love nobody else

Well, I feel like you do
I'm so 'bout done with you
I'm sick and tired of going through changes
'Cause I love you, I hate you
I don't want, but I want to
Back and forth, and back
What should we do?

When love is like a roller coaster
Always up and down
When love takes over, your emotions spin you round and round
When you don't, when you don't know what you're feeling
When you don't, when you don't know what is real
When love is like a roller coaster
Always up and down
And it goes back around

Today I've said some things to you, babe
I don't like the way it felt, no
I've been giving you, giving you so much attitude
I guess I really should check myself

Well, you've started it first
You said we'd make it work
But here we are, going through changes
But I need you, can't stand you
I don't want you, but damn you
Back and forth, and back
What should we do?

When love is like a roller coaster
Always up and down
When love takes over, your emotions spin you round and round
And it goes back around
When you don't, when you don't know what you're feeling
When you don't, when you don't know what is real
When love is like a roller coaster
Always up and down
'Cause it goes back around

We don't ever have to worry, baby
'Cause we gonna be alright
We aren't going nowhere, darling
Just hold on for the ride

When love is like a roller coaster
Always up and down
When love takes over, your emotions spin you round and round
When you don't, when you don't know what you're feeling
When you don't, when you don't know what is real
When love is like a roller coaster
Always up and down
'Cause it goes back around
