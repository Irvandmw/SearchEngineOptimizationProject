Lyrics:


Seen it written and I've heard it told
That a man does things for gold
Drives him crazy and it makes him old
Before his time

Sittin' 'round waitin' for the rainbow's end
Wastin' time and loosin' friends
Never knowin' that it ends before his eyes
But those of us who seek the truth
Will be there when she rides

Talkin' 'bout wings
To carry us over the water
Talkin' 'bout wings
Pickin' us up by the waves
Aw, so many things can breed misunderstandin'
We'll soon be landin' on velvet wings

Once met a man and his words were wise
And he looked me in the eyes
he said brother don't you compromise
What you feel

All things figure in a bigger plan
And it's up to veryman
Just to do the best to reach his own ideals
And build a world around himself
And live it like he feels
Talkin' 'bout wings
To carry us over the water
Talkin' 'bout wings
Pickin' us up by the waves
Aw, so many things can breed misunderstandin'
We'll soon be landin' on velvet wings

Talkin' 'bout wings
To carry us over the water
Talkin' 'bout wings
Pickin' us up by the waves
Aw, so many things can breed misunderstandin'
We'll soon be landin' on velvet wings

Talkin' 'bout wings
To carry us over the water
Talkin' 'bout wings
Pickin' us up by the waves
Aw, so many things can breed misunderstandin'
We'll soon be landin' on velvet wings
