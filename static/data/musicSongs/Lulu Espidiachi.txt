Lyrics:


I will forgive but I won't forget
And I hope you know you've lost my respect!

Y'better watch out!
If you don't know what's going on around you
Y'better think twice
Before you fly off the handle and lose it!
Y'better join us
Before you get lost in the shuffle
You gotta rise against
The demons that are gonna try and hold you down

Does it run in your blood
to betray the ones you love?
Does it run in your blood
to betray the ones you love?
The ones you love
The ones you love
The ones you love

Cause I'm not a pawn
For you to play in your fucking game!
I've got dignity
And I dream that I want to achieve
Under pressure you crumbled and you let me down
I'm not deaf
And all I hear are your empty promises

Does it run in your blood
to betray the ones you love?
Does it run in your blood
to betray the ones you love?
Does it run in your blood
to betray the ones you love?
Does it run in your blood
to betray the ones you love?
The ones you love
The ones you love
The ones you love

Does it run in your blood
to betray the ones you love?
Yes, it runs in your blood
to betray the ones you love!
Yes, it runs in your blood
to betray the ones you love!
Yes, it runs in your blood
to betray the ones you love!
Yes, it runs in your blood
to betray the ones you love!

I will forgive but I won't forget
And I hope you know you've lost my respect!

YES, IT RUNS IN YOUR BLOOD
TO BETRAY THE ONES YOU LOVE!
YES, IT RUNS IN YOUR BLOOD
TO BETRAY THE ONES YOU LOVE!
