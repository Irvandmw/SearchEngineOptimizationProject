Lyrics:


[SAINt JHN:]
Anything can happen' when your wire poppin' every night
Gotta' risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta' keep a boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
Anything can happen' when your wire poppin' every night
Gotta' risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta' keep a boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions

Don't got no regrets, no matter how it turns out
As God on my flesh, I know I never turned down
Married to a life, but we don't never learned vows
Avoidin' the trap shit and I never let out
Want another life, we were livin' risky nights in a prison
Risk it all for a moment to feel known
Just to say that we did it, roll the dice to the limit
This will never feel the same with the dope though
And it's 4:45 in the morning, not even God's here, uh, no
Baby, I don't really need to follow
'Cause in a moment

Anything can happen' when your wire poppin' every night
Gotta' risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta' keep a boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
Anything can happen' when your wire poppin' every night
Gotta' risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta' keep a boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions

[Meek Mill:]
Yeah
Load up the jet, I'm ready (Load it)
I'm tryna live this shit legendary (Livin' it)
I got these niggas upset already
All these diamonds that's on me, they necessary
I got King in my blood, it's hereditary (Yeah)
She show me love like the Fairy Way (She did)
I fell asleep, I was in the pussy
When I woke up she givin' me head already, yeah (Woo)
She wanna' spoil me (Spoil me), I just want loyalty (Loyalty)
Yeah (Yeah)
Choppa' in a Lamborghini, that shit feel like royalty (Royalty)
Yeah, (Yeah)
Niggas know it when they see me, it ain't no extortin' me (Woah)
Me in traffic, it's actually no leg, and I'm movin' accordingly
Iâm watchin' Kanye on the television, talkin' Trump
Heâs supportin' him (Damn)
I have some niggas with tunnel vision, and a plug
They deported them (Damn)
I know some niggas that's jealous of me for my hood
They wanna' slaughter me (Brr)
I know they never can get to me
I done got rich, man these niggas is history
