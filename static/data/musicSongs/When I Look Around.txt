Lyrics:


Hallo yesterday
Doesn't fade away
Living in the shade
I'm trying to escape
Something deep inside
Doesn't feel alright
The color of the truth
And everything is blue

When I look around
Everybody seems to have a life
Walking through the town
Am I just the only one to cry

You can make the magic
And wake me up again
Walking through the town

Living on a dream
Setting up the scene
My reality
Is only you and me
All the pretty things
I wanna take them in
And you can show me how
Don't wanna miss it now

When I look around
Everybody seems to have a life
Walking through the town
Am I just the only one to cry

You can make the magic
And wake me up again
Hold me in the traffic
And kiss me in the rain
Walking through the town

When I look around
Everybody seems to have a life
Walking through the town
Am I just the only one to cry

You can make the magic
And wake me up again
Hold me in the traffic
And kiss me in the rain
Walking through the town

Living in a town
Everybody seems
To be happy when I look around
Living in a town
Everybody smiles
Am I just the only one

When I look around

Living in a town
Everybody seems
To be happy when I look around
Living in a town
Everybody smiles
Am I just the only one

Walking through the town

Living in a town
Everybody seems
To be happy when I look around
Living in a town
Everybody smiles
Am I just the only one

When I look around
