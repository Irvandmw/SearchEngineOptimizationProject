Lyrics:


Somewhere inside I can feel it coming
It's gonna rain where it never rained before
The air is clear and the view is stunning
I was on the road to nowhere
then I had a vision so clear 

[Chorus:] Stuck in the heat of her eyes
Trapped in the heat of the night
Long before I realized I was
stuck in the heat of her eyes 

Somewhere inside the ice is melting
Sun's gonna shine where it never shone before
She's like spring and it's overwhelming
First she told me now or never
then she changed my plans forever 

[Chorus:] Stuck in the heat of her eyes
Trapped in the heat of the night
Long before I realized I was
stuck in the heat of her eyes 

[Outro:] I was on my way to somewhere
She was dancing with flowers in her hair
I was running away from something
But then she showed me that I could really care
