Lyrics:


I think that I just wrote my first country song
I've had this lonesome hurtin' feeling all night long
I didn't know I love her and now she's gone
I think that I just wrote my first country song

I always like to hear those country singers sing
And the way they play those guitars boy they sure do make 'em ring
But when they sing the words I can never sing along
I didn't believe things happen that way
I thought our love was here to stay
Till yesterday she walked away and now they're hittin' home

I think that I just wrote my first country song...

You wrote some words about the good times that you had
And then some lines about losing you mind or missing her so bad
And you did leave out a thing about the way you done her wrong
I sang my song to the saddest note that anybody ever wrote
I think that you just wrote your first country song

I think that I just wrote my first country song...
