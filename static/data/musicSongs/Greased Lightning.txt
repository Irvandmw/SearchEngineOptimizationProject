Lyrics:


[Shane]: Why, this car is automatic
[Kian:] It's systematic
[Shane:] It's...hy-dromatic
[Bryan:] Why, it's greased lightnin'!

[Shane:] We'll get some overhead lifters and four barrell quads, oh yeah
[Kian:] Keep talkin', woah keep talkin
[Shane:] Fuel injection cut off, chrome plated rods, oh yeah
[Kian:] I'll get the money, I'll kill to get the money
[Mark:] With a four-speed on the floor, they'll be waitin' at the door
You know without a doubt, we'll be really makin' out
For greased lightnin'

[Bryan:] Go greased lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile
(Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin')
[Bryan:] Go greased lightnin', you're cruisin' through the heat-lab trial
(Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin')
[Nicky:] You are supreme, the chicks'll scream
For greased lightnin'

[Mark:] We'll get some purple, French tail-lights and thirty inch fins, oh yeah
Palomino dashboard, and duel muffler twins, oh yeah
[Shane:] With new pistons, plugs and shocks, I can get it off my rocks
[Kiann:] You know that I ain't braggin', she's a real draggin' waggon
Greased lightnin'

[Bryan:] Go greased lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile
(Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin')
[Bryan:] Go greased lightnin', you're cruisin' through the heat-lab trial
(Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin')
[Mark:] You are supreme, the chicks'll scream
For greased lightnin'

[clap break]

[Shane:] Go greased lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile
(Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin')
[Bryan:] Go greased lightnin', you're cruisin' through the heat-lab trial
(Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin')
[Nicky:] You are supreme, the chicks'll scream
For greased lightnin'
[Shane:] Go greased lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile
(Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin')
[Bryan:] Go greased lightnin', you're cruisin' through the heat-lab trial
(Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin')
[Shane:] You are supreme, the chicks'll cream
For greased lightnin', lightnin', lightnin', lightnin'
Lightnin', lightnin', lightnin', lightnin'
Ye-ee-eah
