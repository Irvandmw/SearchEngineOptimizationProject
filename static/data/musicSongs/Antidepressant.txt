Lyrics:


Talk about an, talk about an, talk about an, talk about an
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You're more than inspiration (that's right), for every situation (uh-huh)
You make me lose my patience (yeah)
No I can't stand the wait, I need you asap (asap)
When you come around I ain't never going 'bout my way (my way)
I hope you understand that (yeah)
You bring out the best and leave the negative
After I've just had the worst day
Who you love is actually irrelevant
And you should be prescribed for every case

My antidepressant baby (oh woah, hey hey)
My antidepressant baby
Oh, you make me smile when I wanna frown, oh yeah (oh yeah, oh yeah)

I'm so blessed to be in your presence (I'm so blessed)
So modest you ain't worried about fame (about fame)
Reminded that you're needed, of essence
So effortlessly, you're amazing
Conversations so engaging (go on)
Talented, so entertaining
You win me over and over again, yeah

My antidepressant baby, (too slow?, oh woah, hey hey)
My antidepressant baby
Oh, you make me smile when I wanna frown, oh yeah (that's right)

I'm so blessed to be in your presence (yeah)
So modest you ain't worried about fame (about fame)
You're more than inspiration (let's go), for every situation (for every situation)
You make me lose my patience (you make me lose my patience)
No I can't stand the wait, I need you asap (asap)
When you come around I ain't never going 'bout my way (way, yeah)
I hope you understand that

You bring out the best and leave the negative (negative)
After I've just had the worst day (day)
Who you love is actually irrelevant (ah)
And you should be prescribed for every case
My antidepressant baby (oh woah, hey hey)
My antidepressant baby
Oh, you make me smile when I wanna frown, oh yeah (wooh, wooh)
