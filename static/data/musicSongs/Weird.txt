Lyrics:


I like the way you never sleep
And the promises you never keep
I like the way you say hello
And make it sound like time to go

I like the scar above your lip
The way you let your feelings slip
But they're never what you feel
Oh so fake but completely real

Don't you think it's weird
Weirder then weird?
That's what you are
That's what you want to be
What I like about you
Is what you like about me
Don't you think it's weird?

You like the rules that don't apply
And let the good things
Pass you by
Standing here without a plan
That's why your such a happy man

Don't you think it's weird
Weirder then weird?
That's what you are
That's what you want to be
What I like about you
Is what you like about me
Don't you think it's 1,2?

I wanna make some changes
I want my money back
I wanna start up again
I wanna talk to strangers
I wanna be with you
But I just don't know
Where or When

That's what you are
That's what you want to be
What I like about you
Is what you like about me
Don't you think it's weird
Weirder then weird?
That's what you are
That's what you want to be
What I like about you
Is what you like about me
Don't you think it's weird?
