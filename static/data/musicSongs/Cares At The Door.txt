Lyrics:


Everyone that's on your street
Is looking for the perfect beat
And all the things you seek to find
Are sitting here in 4/4 time
So turn your faces to the sky
There isn't long until you die
So take your partner by the hand
And give them all the love you can

You'll, you'll get your way
So for today, just leave your cares at the door
Yeah, we'll be okay
So for today, just leave your cares at the door

Everyone around the world
Is crying out for a lovebird
And everyone to cross your path
Is looking for their other half
And all the stars I fail to see
Are all the boys and girls for me
So take your partner by the hand
And give them all the love you can

[2x]
You'll, you'll get your way
So for today, just leave your cares at the door
Yeah, we'll be okay
So for today, just leave your cares at the door

[2x]
You'll, you'll get your way
So for today, just leave your cares at the door
Yeah, we'll be okay
So for today, just leave your cares at the door
