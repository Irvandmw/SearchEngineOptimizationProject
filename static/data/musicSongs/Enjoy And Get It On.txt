Lyrics:


Oh I'm makin' my way back home
Least that's what I told her on the phone
Been a while since I made her smile
And I know she's gonna dig my style
Could she enjoy me
Really enjoy, gettin' it on

Could I get some of that
When I come in off of the road
Does she still have her fighting gear
Just one look is gonna make it clear
Could she enjoy me
Really enjoy, gettin' it on
Alright

How does it feel holdin' me again
She's holdin' on like it'll never end
Well I'm home thinkin', I should stay
While I'm here just let me hear you say
Say you enjoy babe
Really enjoy, gettin' it on
