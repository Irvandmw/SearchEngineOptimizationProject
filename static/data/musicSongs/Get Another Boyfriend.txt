Get another boyfriend Backstreet ...

check it Let's talk about one,
baby You gotta hear me out
Do you really want to be the last to know
what it's all about
Let's talk about who you say
Is the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't wanna know
I'm tellin you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't wanna know

Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another playa',
Playin in the name of love
I've seen enough, now this must come to an end
Get another Boyfriend

Let's talk about what, 
He's done to become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds,
pearls and party dresses that turned you on
I've seen it before (Don't take!)
Anymore, free too,
You're through for sure
Just go get on with your life STOP!
Acting like you're giving up
I'm telling you, go get on with your life
Stop acting like you're givin up

Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another playa',
Playin in the name of love
I've seen enough, now this must come to an end
(must come to an end)
Get another Boyfriend

[synthesized voicing saying "Why?" & "Get another Boyfriend"]
STOP

Hey Yeah ah
Hear me out, you must know what it's all about
he's just a playa in love this must come to and end 
Get, another boyfriend

Listen, I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothing that he's worthy of
(ain't nothing that he's worthy of)
He's just another playa' ,
Playin in the name of love
I've seen enough, now this must come to an end
Get another , Get another, Get another Boyfriend

Listen, I mean it(hear me now)
There's nothing that he's worthy of
(you must know, what it's all about)
He's just another playa' ,
Playin in the name of love
(he's just a playa in love)
I've seen enough, now this must come to an end
(this must come to an end)
Get another Boyfriend, Get.....another boyfriend
