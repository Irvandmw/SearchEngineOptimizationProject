Lyrics:


Excuse me baby, but you're looking mighty fine
Excuse me baby, if I'm talkin' out of line
Well the way you talk and the way you twist around
You've got me lookin' and I just can't make a sound
Excuse me baby, but you're lookin' good to me

Hey hey sweet thing, I don't your name
I love you pretty baby, I hope you feel the same
When the rightime comes and I want you around
Well come on baby, don't you dare let me down

Excuse me baby, turn those pretty eyes my way
Yeah if I could hold you honey, I'd mould you in my arms like clay
I'd never ever let you out of my sight
Come mornin', noon, evenin', daylight or night
Excuse me baby, that's how I'm feelin', wrong or right
