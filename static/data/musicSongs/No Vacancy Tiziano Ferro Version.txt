Lyrics:


I used to leave the doors unlocked and leave the lights on
I used to stay awake, just counting hours all night long
I had so many empty rooms inside the chateau
Yeah, oh yeah
I'm done with sharing space with people that I don't know
Trading pieces of my heart 'til I felt shallow
I had so many empty rooms inside the chateau, yeah

But ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms
Got no vacancy, ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you

Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy
Prima di te solamente vuoto
Ora tu riempi ogni spazio
Prima di te solamente vuoto
Ora tu riempi ogni spazio
Ogni spazio
Ogni spazio

I used to be the type to never take a chance, oh
Had so many walls, you'd think I was a castle
I spent so many empty nights with faces I don't know

But ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms
Got no vacancy, ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you

Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah
Ogni spazio
Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah
Tu riempi ogni spazio
When I fell, I fell, I fell, I fell for you
So no vacancy, no vacancy
Tu riempi ogni spazio

Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

Prima di te solamente vuoto
Come on, come on, listen
No vacancy
Prima di te solamente vuoto
Oh yeah, oh
Ogni spazio
Oh yeah
Ogni spazio
No vacancy
