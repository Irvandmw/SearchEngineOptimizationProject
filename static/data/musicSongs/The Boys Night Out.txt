Lyrics:


Hey there, mister, build a fence 'round your sister, it's the...
The boys' night out.
Hey there, buster, it's the indians after custer, it's the.
The boys' night out.
They're out to do the town, and before they're through,
It's bound to be liken to.
The night they lost the titanic and the wall street panic.
What they're seeking is a little chickie-chicking, it's the..
The boys' night out,
And that moon's about as big as a honey dew,
It's the boys' night out, and they're so romantic, I'll give you a clue,
What the boys are out after, the girls are out after too.

[music interlude]

They're out to do the town, and before they're through,
It's bound to be liken to.
The night they lost the titanic and the wall street panic,
What they're seeking is a little chickie-chicking, it's the..
The boys' night out,
And that moon's about as big as a honey dew,
It's the boys' night out, and they're so romantic, but I will give you a clue,
What the boys are out after, the girls are out after,
What the boys are out after, the girls are out after too.
