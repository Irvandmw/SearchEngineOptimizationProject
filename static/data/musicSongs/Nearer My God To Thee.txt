Lyrics:


Nearer, My God to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee,
Even though it be a cross, 
That raiseth me... 

Still, all my song shall be, 
Nearer, My God to Thee, 
Nearer, My God to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee... 

Though like the wanderer, 
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me, 
My rest a stone... 

Yet in my dreams I'll be,
Nearer, My God to Thee, 
Nearer, My God to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee... 

There let the way appear, 
Steps unto Heaven,
All that thou sendest me, 
In mercy given! 

Angels to beckon me,
Nearer, My God to Thee, 
Nearer, My God to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee...
