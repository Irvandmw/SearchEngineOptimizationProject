Lyrics:


This year has been a good year, 
Even Maria agrees.
She swears that in a few years, 
sheâll be the next big thing.
They don't believe her, but I let her keep dreaming.

This is the season of a lifetime passing you by.
The fat man is singing oh oh oh
The best things are always gone in the blink of an eye
The drummer boys beating oh oh oh oh

This year has been a good year,
I don't think Johnny agrees.
Christine the girl of his dreams,
Decided to cut him free.
He says he's fine, although his heart thinks differently.

This is the season of a lifetime passing you by.
The fat man is singing oh oh oh oh
The best things are always gone in the blink of an eye
The drummer boys beating oh oh oh oh

Next year we'll be better, they always say
Next year the sun will shine our way
This year has been a good year, 
thatâs what their all telling me.
They swear that this is our year
weâre going to make it big
I'd like to believe them, so I let them keep dreaming.

This is the season of a lifetime passing you by.
The fat man is singing oh oh oh oh
The best things are always gone in the blink of an eye
The drummer boys beating oh oh oh oh
Yeah, oh oh oh oh [x4]
