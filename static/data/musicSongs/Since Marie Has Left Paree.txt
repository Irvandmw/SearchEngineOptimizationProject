Song Name: Since Marie Has Left Paree
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


There's no guy in France, for in France there's no romance,
Since Marie has left Paree.
Every ship that sails took the cargo full of mail,
'Cause Marie has left Paree.
No amour, no more like they used to have before,
There's no Marie, she moved to gay Napoli.
Say bon voyage, I got to go,
Where's my corsage?  Where's my chapeau?
Bye bye Paree, I'm off to Napoli.

[musical interlude]

There's no Marie, she flew off to Napoli.
Say bon voyage, I got to go
Where's my corsage?  Where's my chapeau?
Bye bye, 'cause Marie has left Paree,
Bye bye Paree, I'm jumping off to Napoli.
