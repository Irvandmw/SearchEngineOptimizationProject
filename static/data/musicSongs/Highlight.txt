Lyrics:


Highlight, baby you're my highlight, baby you're my high, high
Highlight, baby you're my highlight, baby you're my high, high

There you go, there you go, there you go making me laugh out loud
There you are, there you are, you just stand out in the crowd
Woah-oh, there you are hmm
I see you smile, I see you smile, see you smiling back at me
Like the sun, shining bright, you're everywhere I wanna be
Woah-oh, I wanna be, yeah

'Cause you're the highlight of my world tonight
I like the way you keep getting it right
I don't know, don't know what to do
But whatever it is don't stop 'cause you
You're the highlight of my world tonight
Keep playing the way, I won't put up a fight
I wanna replay every little thing you do
'Cause you're my highlight, my highlight

Once again, once again, you're making it hard for me to breathe
Did you know? Did you know? That you're the oxygen I need
Woah, you're all I need, yeah
So let the outside world go dark

'Cause you're the highlight of my world tonight
I like the way you keep getting it right
I don't know, don't know what to do
But whatever it is don't stop 'cause you
You're the highlight of my world tonight
Keep playing the way, I won't put up a fight
I wanna replay every little thing you do
'Cause you're my highlight, my highlight

All the cold winds may blow
And all the thunder will roll, roll, roll
Ooh, but I'mma stay by your side
All through the night
'Cause baby all I wanna do is keep on loving you
Uh-huh, 'Cause baby you
Well you're the highlight of my world tonight
I like the way you keep getting it right
I don't know, don't know what to do
But whatever it is don't stop 'cause you
You're the highlight of my world tonight
Keep playing the way, I won't put up a fight
I wanna replay every little thing you do
You're my highlight

You're the highlight of my world tonight
I like the way you keep getting it right
I don't know, don't know what to do
But whatever it is don't stop 'cause you
You're the highlight of my world tonight
Keep playing the way, I won't put up a fight
I wanna replay every little thing you do
'Cause you're my highlight, my highlight

Highlight, baby you're my highlight, baby you're my high, high
Highlight, baby you're my highlight, baby you're my high, high
Highlight, baby you're my highlight, baby you're my high, high
