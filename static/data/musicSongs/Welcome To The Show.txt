Lyrics:


Yeh yeh, oh yeh
Yeh yeh, oh yeh

Been around the world,
Gone from place to place,
(So good to be back again)
Coz it feels so good,
Seeing you face to face,
(No doubt about it, make no mistake)
We've seen so many things,
But there really ain't nothing like this,
Ain't nothing gonna stop me
Coz whenever we're feeling down,
You lift us back up again
So turn up the sound and let it go

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the show
Were the people gettin outta control
From the back to the front row,
Get up, lets go
For the guys and the girls gettin wild,
Gotta keep this dream alive,
If you don't like how we ride,
Kiss kiss, bye bye!

Talk about my life
Can you see in through my eyes
(Things have changed but we're still the same)
Make up your own mind
Coz we don't believe the hype, oh no
(That's what happens when you play the game)

We've seen so many things,
But there ain't nothing like this (oh no)
Ain't nothing gonna stop me (oh no)
Coz whenever we're feeling down,
You lift us back up again
So turn up the sound and get with the flow!

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the show
Were the people gettin outta control
From the back to the left front row,
Get up, lets go
For the guys and the girls gettin wild,
Gotta keep this dream alive,
If you don't like how we ride (we ride)
Kiss kiss, bye bye!

Listen up this is dedicated to the fans,
you know who you are, show us your hands
Ride the well drift,I reminisce,
I remember my fans like my first kiss
Being young you follow your dream,
You wanna be a star from a cover of a magazine,
As things take toll, you start to believe,
I want you to know you're a part of this team, yo the fans

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the show
Were the people gettin outta control
From the back to the left front row,
Get up, lets go
For the guys and the girls gettin wild,
Gotta keep this dream alive,
If you don't like how we ride (we ride)
Kiss kiss, bye bye!

Welcome to the show (welcome to the show)
Were the people gettin outta control
From the back to the front row,
Get up, lets go
For the guys and the girls gettin wild,(guys and the girls)
Gotta keep this dream alive, (gotta keep this dream alive)
If you don't like how we ride (we ride)
Kiss kiss, bye bye!

[Repeat to fade:]
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh,
Oh no no no
