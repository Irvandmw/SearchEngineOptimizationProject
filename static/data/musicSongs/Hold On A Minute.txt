Lyrics:


Pretty young, you wanna stay?
As the days just rush away
And you know that you can't stop the time
Turning on the radio
No more songs from long ago
The world has lost its mind

Hold on a minute
There's no limit
Make every moment last
The world is changing fast
And I wanna see you laugh
Time is a number
Life is a wonder
Make every second count
I am still spellbound
As long as you're around

Listen to the wind of change
Everything has rearranged
But the moon always looked the same
You fall asleep in my car
And dream away the hitting scars
Somewhere between the stars

Hold on a minute
There's no limit
Make every moment last
The world is changing fast
And I wanna see you laugh
Time is a number
Life is a wonder
Make every second count
I am still spellbound
As long as you're around

Save a little sun for rainy days
We're gonna need it all the way
Keep it in your heart
Use it when it all gets dark
Save a little time for me tonight
Because I need a place to hide
In my own despair
I just need you here

Hold on a minute
There's no limit
Make every moment last
The world is changing fast
And I wanna see you laugh
Time is a number
Life is a wonder
Make every second count
I am still spellbound
As long as you're around

Hold on a minute

Time is a number
