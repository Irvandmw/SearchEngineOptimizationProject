Lyrics:


Another Friday night I'm somewhere
A little drunk and worn out from the show
It's a hallway to a hotel room
The truck's already rolling down the road
I find the lights take off my coat
I see her there just lying on the bed
She's seen me through my yesterdays
God knows tonight I'm needing her again

She's the place I go
When there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold
When there's no one to hold on to

She's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark
She heard my every word
When I was pouring out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar

She's given me her best
When I am at my worst
When I can't find the pieces
Fingers scratching in the dirt
She offers no forgiveness
Cause she likes to make it hurt

She's the place I go
When there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold
When there's no one to hold on to

She's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark
She heard my every word
When I was pouring out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar

Morning like a freight train
Last night still ringing in my head
Before today becomes tomorrow
Tonight I know I'll do it all again

She's the place I go
When there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold
When there's no one to hold on to

She's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark
She heard my every word
When I was pouring out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar
And so I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar
