Lyrics:


I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

I told you I wouldnât call, I told you I wouldnât care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I donât think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

You can say weâre done the way you always do
Itâs easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know theyâre gonna say
Weâre bad for each other, but we ainât good for anyone else

I told you I wouldnât call, I told you I wouldnât care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I donât think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We donât have to miss each other, come over
We donât have to fix each other, come over
We donât have to say forever, come over
You donât have to stay forever, come over

I told you I wouldnât call, I told you I wouldnât care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I donât think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over.
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over.
