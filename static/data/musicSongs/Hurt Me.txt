Lyrics:


You don't get to hurt me
You don't get to hurt me

We were good 'til it wasn't
'Til it all fell apart (Uh huh)
Every tear wasn't worth it
So I had to move on (Uh huh)
We were done from the get go
I wouldn't say we were friends (Uh huh)
But I ain't easy to let go
You don't have to pretend (Uh huh)

You're acting like a child now
Trying to take your anger out
Well, get my name out of your mouth
If you're just gonna tear me down

Don't be so bitter, how 'bout we keep it sweet? (Ah)
No need to talk to me like we're enemies (Ah)
No, you were never worth all my energy
And just 'cause you're hurting don't mean you get to hurt me
Don't be so bitter, how 'bout we keep it sweet? (Uh huh)
No need to talk to me like we're enemies (Uh huh)
No, you were never worth all my energy
And just 'cause you're hurting don't mean you get to hurt me

Tell me (Tell me)
How can I help you get to the healing?
Why you gotta have so many feelings? Yeah
Tell me (Tell me)
Is you mad for a whole 'nother reason
Why you gotta have so many feelings?

You're acting like a child now
Trying to take your anger out
Well, get my name out of your mouth
If you're just gonna tear me down, oh

Don't be so bitter, how 'bout we keep it sweet? (Ah)
No need to talk to me like we're enemies (Ah)
No, you were never worth all my energy
And just 'cause you're hurting don't mean you get to hurt me

You don't get to hurt me
No, no, no, no
You don't get to hurt me
No, no, no, no (Hey, yeah)
You don't get to hurt me
No, no, no, no
You don't get to hurt me (No, you don't)
No, no, no, no

Don't be so bitter, how 'bout we keep it sweet?
You don't need to talk to me like we're enemies
No, you were never worth all my energy
And just 'cause you're hurting
Don't mean you get to hurt me (Hey yeah, oh no)
Don't be so bitter, how 'bout we keep it sweet? (Ah, yeah)
No need to talk to me like we're enemies (Woo)
No, you were never worth all my energy
And just 'cause you're hurting
Don't mean you get to hurt me (No, no)

You don't get to hurt me
No, no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
You don't get to hurt me
No, no, no, no (Yeah, yeah)
You don't get to hurt me
No, no, no, no
You don't get to hurt me
