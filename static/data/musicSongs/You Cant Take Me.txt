Lyrics:


You can't take me
Yeah

Gotta fight another fight
I gotta run another night
I get it out
Check it out
I'm on my way and it don't feel right

I gotta get me back
I can't be beat and that's a fact
It's OK
I'll find a way
It ain't gonna take me down no way

Don't judge a thing
'Til you know what's inside it
Don't push me
I'll fight it
Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no

If you can't catch a wave
Then you're never gonna ride it
You can't come uninvited
Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no

You can't take me
I'm free

Why did it all go wrong?
I wanna know what's going on
What's this holding me?
I'm not where I'm supposed to be

I gotta fight another fight
I gotta fight with all my might
I'm getting out,
So check it out
You're in my way, yeah, you better watch out

Oh, come on!

Don't judge a thing
'Til you know what's inside it
Don't push me
I'll fight it
Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no

If you can't catch a wave
Then you're never gonna ride it
You can't come uninvited
Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no

You can't take me
I'm free

Oh yeah! I'm free!
