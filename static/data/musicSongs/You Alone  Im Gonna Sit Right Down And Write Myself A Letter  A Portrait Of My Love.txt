Lyrics:
Lyrics:


Sing to me, Mr. C., sing to me 
the song that I've been waiting to hear, 
just for me, Mr. C., just for me, 
and everybody else will disappear... 

You alone, you alone, 
are the dream I have known, 
bringing love to my lonely heart! 

Now there's heaven in view, 
Now the dream has come true, 
For tonight I have you alone! 

Now that your eyes have told me, 
You are my love my own, 
Come to my arms and hold me, 
I live for you alone! 
Solo tu, solo tu... 

[Italian]

Now there's heaven in view, 
Now the dream has come true, 
For tonight I have you alone! 

I'm gonna sit right down 
an' write myself a letter 
and make believe it came from you! 

I'm gonna write words so sweet 
they're gonna knock me off my feet 
a lot of kisses on the bottom 
I'll be glad I got them 

I'm gonna smile and say "I hope you're feelin' better" 
and close with love the way you do 
I'm gonna sit right down an' write myself a letter 
and make believe it came from you! 

I'm gonna sit right down 
an' write myself a letter 
and make believe it came 
...from you! 

There could never be a portrait of my love 
for nobody could paint a dream! 
You will never see a portrait of my love 
for miracles are never seen! 

Anyone who sees her, 
soon forgets the Mona Lisa! 
It would take I know, a Michael Angelo, 
and he would need the glow of dawn 
that paints the sky above 
to try an' paint a portrait of my love! 

...yes, he would need the glow of dawn 
that paints the sky above 
to try an' paint a portrait of my love!
