Lyrics:


Vagabond shoes, why did you roam?
Why did you take me far from home?
Far from the mountains, the rivers, and streams,
Just chasing a dream

Vagabond shoes, you've gone a stray
Happiness lies the other way
So, turn around, turn around
Away from the blues...

Take me home again, home again, home again vagabond shoes
