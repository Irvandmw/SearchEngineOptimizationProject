Lyrics:


At first I didn't like this beat, I just liked the build-up (Uh-huh)
She tryna fall in love with me, I'm just tryna hit her (Yeah, yeah)
She stalkin' me on Instagram 'cause I don't fuck with Twitter (Hmm)
Say she think her boyfriend scared of me, he say that I'm a killer
(Mari beats, turn me up)

Why he say that? (Huh)
He better deal wit' it (Huh)
Yeah, she gone now (She gone)
Got caught by a real nigga (Hmm)
Wanna be on her own now (Her own)
She wanna roam out (Roam)
Tired of you treatin' her like a lil' girl
She wanna be grown now (Grown)
She wanna get dressed and go flex when they play her song now
You tryna take the bitch up the street, she tryna get flown out
She tryna date, go out to eat, but bitch, we ain't goin' out (Oh, no)
I'm fuckin' her great, I got the keys, I can get in your home now (Ha)
I'm all in your shit, nigga (Yeah)
Thuggin' it out, feet on the couch like I pay the rent, nigga (Yeah)
She runnin' her mouth, I'm beatin' her down, I'm talkin' my shit, nigga (Yeah)
You ever find out, come see what I'm 'bout, you know how I get, nigga (Ha)
You know how I'm built, nigga

At-at-at first I didn't like this beat, I just liked the build-up (Uh-huh)
She tryna fall in love with me, I'm just tryna hit her (Yeah, yeah)
She stalkin' me on Instagram 'cause I don't fuck with Twitter (Hmm)
Say she think her boyfriend scared of me, he say that I'm a killer (Ha)
Why he say that?
