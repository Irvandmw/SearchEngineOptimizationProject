[A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie:]
Yeah, shawty got ass, she just got a tummy tuck, yeah
Startenders, run it up
Ah
Let's get into it
Watch your bitch
Yeah
Ah

Hmm, ain't fucking with no off brand bitch
Ooh, don't think these niggas understand me
Ooh, she let me touch it in Miami
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I'm Biggaveli, ah ooh yeah

Ooh, I see it in you
You just left your man, that's too bad, ooh
Pull up in a foreign like skrt skrt
All up in your feelings, yeah you seem so hurt
Elliot the chains, now it's time to run it up
In the game, got a two, so you know they wanna pop, yeah
Yeah, shawty got ass
She just got a tummy tuck, yeah
Startenders, run it up

Hmm, ain't fucking with no off brand bitch
Ooh, don't think these niggas understand me
Ooh, she let me touch it in Miami
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I'm Biggaveli
Hmm, ain't fucking with no off brand bitch
Ooh, don't think these niggas understand me
Ooh, she let me touch it in Miami
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I'm Biggaveli

[Offset:]
Offset!
Hunnid in my fanny, yeah (Hunnid)
Runnin' up the engine for my family, huh (Fam)
Wanna hop on jet, take off your panties, huh (Woo)
Baguettes in my wrist and they can't stand me, huh (Baguettes)
Coco on my Maybach like it's "Free Meech" (Smash, smash)
Shoot the hundred round and get your street sweeped (Brrt, brrt)
Patek on my wrist, this shit ain't cheap, cheap (Woo)
Perky or the Addy, which one you gon' eat?
If we got static, send the baddie, meet the Grim Reaper (Statis, static)
Green lime Lambo' with your bitch creepin' (Skrrt)
He got to poppin' 'bout it, so I let the TEC eat him (Brrt, huh)
I put the Nawf up on my back, I get the M's and feed 'em (Hey!)

[A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie:]
Hmm, ain't fucking with no off brand bitch
Ooh, don't think these niggas understand me
Ooh, she let me touch it in Miami
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I'm Biggaveli
Hmm, ain't fucking with no off brand bitch
Ooh, don't think these niggas understand me
Ooh, she let me touch it in Miami
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I'm Biggaveli, ah ooh yeah

[Tyga:]
Bitch, I'm number one like I'm Nelly (Nelly)
And my crib all white like Belly (Belly)
And my bitch ride for me like Remy (Remy)
Poppin' shots, thug life, Makaveli
Send the cash to my celly, have my nigga go get it
Then we split it like a splinter, if I'm in it, it ain't rented
Got the rims so biggie and my cars look skinny
Good pussy and you pretty, but you better off the Henny (Yeah)
I ain't Ray J, told a bitch, "Wait a minute" (Yeah)
Diamonds on my dick, told the bitch, "Come and get it" (Hol' up)
Shawty, you a star, got all these niggas wishin'
She gotta make it count, hit me up, when you finished

[A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie:]
Hmm, ain't fucking with no off brand bitch
Ooh, don't think these niggas understand me
Ooh, she let me touch it in Miami
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I'm Biggaveli
Hmm, ain't fucking with no off brand bitch
Ooh, don't think these niggas understand me
Ooh, she let me touch it in Miami
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I'm Biggaveli, ah ooh yeah

Head, shoulders, knees, focus
Head, shoulders, knees, focus, yeah
Head, yeah, shoulders, yeah, knees, yeah, going, yeah
Head and shoulders, yeah, knees, yeah, focus, yeah
Head, shoulders, knees, focus
Head, shoulders, knees, focus, yeah
Head and shoulders, yeah, knees, yeah, going, yeah
Head and shoulders, yeah, knees, yeah, going, yeah
Hmm, ain't fucking with no off brand bitch (Bang)
