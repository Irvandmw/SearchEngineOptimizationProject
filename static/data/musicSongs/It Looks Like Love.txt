Lyrics:


It looks like love
It feels like love
And I confess it's got me rocking on my heels like love
How else can I account for that unexpected glow
That turns the night to day each time we say hello

It looks like love
Ah it could be love
But if it's not it's so darn wonderful it should be love
There's a lot more I can tell you but you take my breath away
Yes it looks like love is here to stay

It looks like love
It could be love
But if it's not it's so darn wonderful it should be love
There's a lot more I can tell you but you take my breath away
Yes it looks like love
Is here to stay
