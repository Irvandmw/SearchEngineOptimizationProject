Lyrics:


Pretender
Ooh, pretender...

I wake myself up every time
I daydream of love for you and me
'Cause I'm just fooling myself
I should remember 
You're just a pretender of love

(Nothing but a pretender)
Can't love no one
(Pretending to be in love)
Ooh, pretender
(No one but a pretender)
Can't love no one
(Pretends to be in love)

You can't trust the imagination
It never tells you who's for real
You don't give love 
You're just a lender
I should remember 
That you're just a pretender

(Nothing but a pretender)
Can't love no one
(Pretending to be in love)

Oh but I wanted (to be your)
I wanted to be (to be your lover)
To be what you wanted
Everything you could need
Oh yeah (every)
You were everything (I could dream of)
I ever could dream of
But I really (should be your)
Really should be (should be your lover)
Keeping your, feeling your, having your love
Oh, pretender (pretender)
Pretender
Give me your love

Pretender
Why can't you be for real?
Aw, baby
Pretender
Why won't you believe in what you feel?

Well, I thought you were mine, baby, all the time
And I know that you dig what I'm sayin'
It's a player's dream just to have a fool
But sweet baby, I ain't playin'
It's funky nothin's, baby

(Nothing but a pretender)
Can't love no one
(Pretending to be in love)
Ooh pretender
(No one but a pretender)
Can't love no one
(Pretending to in love)
Ooh pretender
(Nothing but a pretender)
Can't love no one
(Pretending to be in love)
Ooh pretender
(No one but a pretender)
Pretender
(Pretending to in love)
Oh pretender
(Nothing but a pretender)
Can't love no one
(Pretending to be in love)
Ooh pretender
(No one but a pretender)
Can't love no one
(Pretending to be in love)
