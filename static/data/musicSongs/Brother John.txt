Lyrics:


I saw this child who never smiled
I told him that's no way to live your life I saw him kneel down on his knees
As he said please, please, please
It's as if I could see inside his mind
And it reminded me of mine
And it became clear that he belonged here
And he promised me he'd try

If only you could have been there,
With me and my brother John
We tried so hard not to carry on
But if we're so optimistic well that one he was around
Let me know if you see him around
Let me know if you see him downtown

I know there is something better than this
I know there is
There's gotta be
I know there is something better than this
I know there is
There's gotta be

I know there
Is a place where I can just hang out
With the friends who I brang out
We can have some laughs smile and drink and have a good time
With all the people we get
Who I could never forget
La la, la la la la la la
Lotsa things that I would like to say
To you in your troubled state
But it's so hard when you're so good at keeping it to yourself
And wait till the sun comes up in the morning
If you come back we'll find a place for you
