Lyrics:


You said you were leavin'
You ain't comin' back and that's that
If there was love between us
It was all wrong, so I'm gone

Ever since the day you left
Your words keep ringing in my head

Goodbye is goodbye
Letting go for the very last time
No reason left to fight
Is by turning out the lights
Your goodbye is goodbye is goodbye, yeah

Now you're standing in front of me
Tears in your eyes, makes me wanna cry
You said you made a big mistake
Yeah, I understand but I'm a different man

You stayed away a little too long, girl
And I found the strength to move on

Goodbye is goodbye
Letting go for the very last time
No reason left to fight
Is by turning out the lights
Your goodbye is goodbye is good, goodbye, yeah, ooh

Let me walk you to your car
You'll always have a piece of my heart

Goodbye is goodbye
Letting go for the very last time
No reason left to fight
Is by turning out the lights

Goodbye is goodbye
Letting go for the very last time
No reason left to fight
Is by turning out the lights
Your goodbye is goodbye, goodbye is goodbye, yeah

Goodbye
