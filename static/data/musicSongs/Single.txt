Lyrics:


Everybody get up and get up yeah
Everybody let go 'cause we don't care
We single
We goin' solo solo
[x2]

I need everyone's attention
I got things to say
I got words to mention
So come my way
I don't need to be braggin' 
Not always open to how I feel

But tonight I'm gon' be

Single
(Put 'em up for yourself yeah
If you're wrapped here and you're)
Single
(Let me know that you're with me
You're free tonight and)
Single
[x2]

For everyone who's single
Just know that I'm with you
Independent yes
And we do what we gotta do

Oh I won't be you're one and only love
I got time to mingle
So let's do it up

I don't need to be braggin'
Not always open to how I feel

But tonight I'm gon' be

Single
(Put 'em up for yourself yeah
If you're wrapped here and you're)
Single 
(You're free tonight and)
Single
[x2]

Everybody get up and get up yeah
Everybody let go 'cause we don't care
We single
We goin' solo solo
[x2]

Put 'em up for yourself yeah
If you're wrapped and you're
Single
Let me know that you're with me
You're free tonight and
Single 
[x5]
