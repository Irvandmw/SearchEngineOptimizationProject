Lyrics:


(Yeah)
Know you tryna be
Know you tryna be, a gentleman
A gentleman
Trying to impress
Tryna be the best, specimen
Perfect specimen (yeah)

And don't get me wrong, I appreciate ya
And don't get me wrong, I really do
And don't get me wrong, but I'm tired of waiting
Say you don't wanna cross the line
But I'ma make you change your mind

No seas cortÃ©s
I'ma make you change your mind
No seas cortÃ©s
You don't wanna cross the line
But I'ma make you change your mind

See it in my lips
You feel it in my kiss
I'm desperate, so desperate
I know you wanna too
Cause the way you touch me, you
Keep proving it, you're proving it (yeah)

And don't get me wrong, I appreciate ya
And don't get me wrong, I really do
And don't get me wrong, but I'm done with patience
Say you don't wanna cross the line
But I'ma make you change your mind

No seas cortÃ©s
I'ma make you change your mind
No seas cortÃ©s
You don't wanna cross the line
I'ma make you change your mind

I can see it in your eyes
That you wanna be polite
That you wanna treat me right
Oh my (No seas cortÃ©s)

I can see it in your eyes
That you wanna be polite
That you wanna treat me right
Oh my (No seas cortÃ©s)

Yo sÃ© que estÃ¡s intentando ser educado
Yo sÃ© que me quieres tratar bien
Pero no seas cortÃ©s (no seas cortÃ©s)
Yo sÃ© que estÃ¡s intentando ser educado
Yo sÃ© que me quieres tratar bien
Pero no seas cortÃ©s
Say you don't wanna cross the line
But I'ma make you change your mind

No seas cortÃ©s
I'ma make you change your mind
No seas cortÃ©s
You don't wanna cross the line
But I'ma make you change your mind
No seas cortÃ©s
I'ma make you change your mind (change your mind)
No seas cortÃ©s
You don't wanna cross the line
But I'ma make you change your mind
