Ha
Baby Jesus, I'm on they ass
Can I talk my shit?
I'ma talk my shit
Firzt on the track
Fuck, hey, turn up

I'm on they ass, look at me now, I'm on they ass
You niggas buyin' my swag, look at me now, you keep on buyin' my swag
Watch how I do my lil' dance, look at me now
I had to run up them bands, look at me now
Ooh, look at me now, just look at me now
I had to turn up my swag, look at me now, I had to turn up my swag
I had to go get them bands, look at me now, go get them bands
I got these fuck niggas mad, look at me now, ha

Fuck is that lil' nigga talkin' 'bout? Let's be for real
All of that shit that you rap about, that's what I live
Somebody call the police, they keep stealing my swag
Way too much bread in my jeans, I'ma need me a bag
I wasn't even gon' speak, but he's getting me mad
I'm actually starting to think that these niggas some fags
You do a whole lot of lookin', but you lookin' bad
These niggas don't even got cars and they talkin' 'bout gas

I'm on they ass, look at me now, I'm on they ass
You niggas buyin' my swag, look at me now, you keep on buyin' my swag
Watch how I do my lil' dance, look at me now
I had to run up them bands, look at me now
Ooh, look at me now, just look at me now
I had to turn up my swag, look at me now, I had to turn up my swag
I had to go get them bands, look at me now, go get them bands
I got these fuck niggas mad, look at me now

I can't show no niggas no mercy, my foot up they ass
Goofy ass nigga, you thirsty, you stealing my swag
When you see me bounce through the club, get the fuck out the way
Somebody get this lil' nigga the fuck out my face
Please do not stand in my section like you with the squad
All of us known for finessin', and you can get robbed
I won't take a picture with you, but I will with my bitch
Tonight I am not in the mood, its just me and my niggas

I'm on they ass, look at me now, I'm on they ass
You niggas buyin' my swag, look at me now, you keep on buyin' my swag
Watch how I do my lil' dance, look at me now
I had to run up them bands, look at me now
Ooh, look at me now, just look at me now
I had to turn up my swag, look at me now, I had to turn up my swag
I had to go get them bands, look at me now, go get them bands
I got these fuck niggas mad, look at me now

Ha
I see how you lookin'
I'm on they ass
