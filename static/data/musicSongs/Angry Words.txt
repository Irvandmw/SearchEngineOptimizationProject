Lyrics:


I don't know why I did it, I guess I lost my head
I should have said 'I love you' but used angry words instead

Angry words that were so unfair
Angry words, I should have said 'I care'

It's easy to apologize, it's harder to forget
You made the loving easy but I made you so upset

With angry words that were so unfair
Angry words, I should have said 'I care'

I've stood right beside you, I've changed in many ways
I stand here ever faithful but I still have my bad days

And angry words can sometimes fly
Angry words where once I use to cry

It's easy to apologize, it's harder to forget
You made the loving easy but I made you so upset

With angry words, that were so unfair
Angry words, I should have said 'I care'

Angry words, that were so unfair
I should have said 'I care'
