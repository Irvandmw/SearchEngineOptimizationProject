Lyrics:


Outside my window I can hear the radio
And I know that motor-wagon's gettin' ready to fly
'Cause it's almost Saturday Night

Bye, bye tomorrow, gonna go to the rodeo
And I know some good ol' boy's gettin' ready to ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday Night

Gonna push the clouds away
Let the music have it's way
Gonna steal her heart away
And you know I'm goin'

Outside their singing, the night train is bringing me home
When you hear that locomotion getting ready ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night

Gonna push the clouds away
Let the music have it's way
Gonna steal her heart away
And you know I'm goin'

Outside their singing, the night train is bringing me home
When you hear that locomotion getting ready ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night
