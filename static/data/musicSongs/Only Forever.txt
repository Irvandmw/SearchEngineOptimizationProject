Lyrics:


Do I want to be with you
As the years come and go
Only forever, if you care to know
Would I grant all your wishes
And be proud of the task
Only forever if someone should ask

How long would it take me to be near if you beckoned
Off hand I would figure less than a second
Do you think I'd remember
How you look when you smile
Only forever oh, that's putting it mild

How long would it take me to be near if you beckoned
Off hand I would figure less than a second
Do you think I'd remember
How you look when you smile
Only forever and it's putting it mild
