Lyrics:


I'm tired of my thoughts
They weigh me down
Feels like I'm drowning
I'm tired of my flaws
They fill me with anxiety and doubt
Honestly, I'm done with hating pictures of myself
And tryna be like everybody else

I wanna be like, look like
The girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like
No one's watching her
I could try to
Be just like you
But I wanna be like me
The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror

I'm sick of the likes and followers everyone's counting
I'm sick of the lies
Smiling but I'm crying inside
Honestly, I'm done with hating pictures of myself
And tryna be like everybody else

I wanna be like, look like
The girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like
No one's watching her
I could try to
Be just like you
But I wanna be like me
The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror

Wanna wake up, no make-up
And still think I'm beautiful
Wanna smile like I mean it
And finally be comfortable with me
Finally be comfortable with me
Oh

I wanna be like, look like
The girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like
No one's watching her
I could try to
Be just like you
But I wanna be like me
The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
(The girl in the mirror)
The girl in the mirror
