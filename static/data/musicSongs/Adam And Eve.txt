Lyrics:


In the garden of Eden, a long time ago
yeah, there was a story I'm sure you will know
I'm sure you remember, I know you believe
the story of Adam and Eve

In the garden of Eden where live began
yes the very beginning of woman and man
I'm sure you remember and I know you believe
the story of Adam and Eve

They were in the garden while they both fell in love
sheltered by the guiding hand of the one above
Life was filled with happiness until one day around
a very great temptation, you know how it goes

In the garden of Eden, a long time ago
there was a story I'm sure you will know
I'm sure you remember, I'm sure you believe
the story of Adam and Eve

In the garden of Eden, a long time ago, such a story ...
