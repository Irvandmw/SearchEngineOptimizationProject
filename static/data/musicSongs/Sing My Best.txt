Lyrics:


Wake up in the morning
Long way from home
Alarm clock is a warning
Im still alone
Set up for a letdown
Opened my eyes
New name for the same town
It's no suprise

Its another rough day alright
But I cant wait til tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I cant wait til tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Wake up in the morning
Another day
Grey skies bring the storm in 
Things never change
Stare out of the window
Through tired eyes
So hard just to let go
It's no suprise

That its another rough day alright
But I cant wait til tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I cant wait til tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight I'll get up on that stage
And all my problems seem to go away
Tonight I'll get up in those lights
And I will sing my best for you tonight

No I cant wait til tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I cant wait til tonght, tonight, tonight, tonight
I cant wait til tonight...
