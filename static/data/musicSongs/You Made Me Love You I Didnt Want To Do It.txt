Lyrics:


You made me love you I didn't wanna do it didn't wanna do it
You made me want you all the time you knew it I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes you made me glad
But there were times my darling you made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for I'm gonna tell ye didn't wanna tell ye
I want some love that's true yes I do indeed I do you know I do
Give me give me give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you

(You made me sigh for I didn't wanna tell ye didn't wanna tell ye
I want some love that's true yes I do indeed I do you know I do)
Oh give me give me give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you
