Lyrics:


Take a look at this little girl.
Prettiest in this little world.
Got a little twist and curl.
And she calls me Daddy-O.
And she calls me Daddy-O.

Take a look at this little smile.
Cutest one I've seen in a while.
Got a lot of class and style.
And she calls me Daddy-O.
And she calls me Daddy-O.

Oh, oh, oh, got a funny feelin'.
Oh, oh, oh, it's my heart she's stealin'.
Oh, oh, oh, she is so appealin'.
When she calls me Daddy-O.
When she calls me Daddy-O.

She can make the Earth stand still.
She can reach the window sill.
She can give my heart a thrill.
When she calls me Daddy-O.
When she calls me Daddy-O.

Oh, oh, oh, got a funny feelin'.
Oh, oh, oh, it's my heart she's stealin'.
Oh, oh, oh, she is so appealin'.
When she calls me Daddy-O.
When she calls me Daddy-O.

Take a look at silk and lace.
Take a look at this little face.
When she's in her dad's embrace.
And she calls me Daddy-O.
And she calls me Daddy-O.

Oh, oh, oh, got a funny feelin'.
Oh, oh, oh, it's my heart she's stealin'.
Oh, oh, oh, she is so appealin'.
When she calls me Daddy-O.
When she calls me Daddy-O.

Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
