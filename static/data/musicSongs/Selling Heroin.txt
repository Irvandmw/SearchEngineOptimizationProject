[Gucci Mane:]
I look like I'm selling heroin, I look like I'm selling heroin
Man, I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin
I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin
I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm so illegal
Man I just did a song with Sevyn, she say I'm streeter
Man, I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin
I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin

This ain't a gimmick, it's an epidemic
I got that shit that'll bust your heart, make you get to itching
I got that shit that make a junkie walk from Mississippi
I got these bitches selling blood to get a fix in
Man she can't even find a vein to catch a drain
My niggas might hijack a plane to get the cain
I'm Gucci Mane, I feel like Sosa, Moet mamosa
I got 'em smoking like a motor to meet the quota
This parking spot reserved for kingpins, it's reserved
I look like I just robbed a kingpin for 100 birds
Man come and holler at your boy, I got that boy
They know Guwop about his bills, LeSean McCoy

I look like I'm selling heroin, I look like I'm selling heroin
Man, I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin
I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin
I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm so illegal
Man I just did a song with Sevyn, she say I'm streeter
Man, I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin
I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin

[Future:]
Junkies at the front door, I got junkies at the back door
Got them niggas wrapping dummies
I got niggas pulling kick doors
I got hoes in Frisco, I got hoes live in the NO
You want you a ho and you know we call that a demo
Came from out the section, stash a million in the Pinto
'69 Camaro, boy you remixing send a kilo
Look inside this barrel if you look into the peep hole
I just popped a tab and I keep that Dan Marino
I got European niggas pulling heists, [?]
I go Donald Trump when I'm looking for the c-note
You get hit with pump if you fighting over the kilo
Looking at my wrist, man this shit should be illegal
Like heroin, like heroin, like heroin

[Gucci Mane:]
I look like I'm selling heroin, I look like I'm selling heroin
Man, I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin
I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin
I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm so illegal
Man I just did a song with Sevyn, she say I'm streeter
Man, I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin
I look like I'm selling heroin, I'm selling heroin

[Future:]
My watch and my chains is litted
My rings and ears sidity
Yeah, my watch and bag on Nicki
20 chains on me now
90 bricks on me now
We might pass you in a drought
He bout to bring they ass out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
