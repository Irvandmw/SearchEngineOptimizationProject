Lyrics:


You are brawling hard
Santa Monica Boulevard
Black tint glass on your cherry red car
You know very well no oneâs bad as you are

Youâre hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
Youâre hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

Oh, you look so hot
Your face is like a map of the stars
Your switch blade smile and your battle scars
Iâm so hot for you baby, baby, this love is ours

Youâre still in the game
I want you to change
Stop making it right
I wanna be your girl, wanna be your girl

Youâre hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
Youâre hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

Oh, you look like art
Shining like a star in the dark
Lightning strikes, youâre my infinite spark
Set the world on fire and itâs lovely to watch 

Dead scared of your name, they know youâre insane
I like it that way, I have to be your girl
I gotta be your girl

Youâre hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
An arrow through my heart, now I want you a lot

Life is wild, like a little game
That we like to play just for fun, just for fun
âCause we take nothing seriously
Nothingâs wrong, nothingâs wrong

Life is like, like a piece of cake
âCause we love to play just for fun in the sun
Yeah, we know nothing means a thing
âCause we have won, boy, we won

Oh, be still my heart
Youâre shining like a light in the dark

Youâre hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
Youâre hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

Youâre hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
Youâre hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
