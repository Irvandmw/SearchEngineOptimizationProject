Song Name: Like Heaven

Lyrics:


The silence has been screaming
As I search through all the reasons
Why, why you're gone
The sunset never ceases
As my world just falls to pieces
And I try to go on

Our friends they call to see if I'm okay
The answer is in every word I don't say

Your memory tears me into
I miss everything when it comes to you
And this pain just won't give up on me that easily
It still hurts like hell cause you were like heaven to me

I have been in bed
For about a week now and I guess
That it's time to wake
Cleaning out the closet
Taking down all of the pictures
Of yesterday

I could burn this whole place down and build it again
But I'd still feel you under my skin

Your memory tears me into
I miss everything when it comes to you
And this pain just won't give up on me that easily
It still hurts like hell cause you were like heaven to me
