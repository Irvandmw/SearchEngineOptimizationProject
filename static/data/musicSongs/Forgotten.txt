Lyrics:


I'm giving up on everything
Because you messed me up.
Don't know how much you screwed it up.
You never listened.
That's just too bad.

Because I'm moving on.
I won't forget.
You were the one that was wrong.
I know I need to step up and be strong.
Don't patronize me.

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it.
Do you get it now?

Gotta get away.
There's no point in thinking about yesterday.
It's too late now.
It won't ever be the same.
We're so different now.

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it.
Do you get it now?

I know I wanna run away.
I know I wanna run away.
Run away.
If only I could run away.
If only I could run away.
Run away.

I told you what I wanted.
I told you what I wanted.
What I wanted.
But I was forgotten.
I won't be forgotten
Never again.

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it.
Do you get it now?
Do you get it now?

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it.
Do you get it now?

Have you forgotten?
Do you get it now?
Forgotten.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Forgotten.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Forgotten.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Forgotten.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
