Lyrics:


Singing a lullaby while the baby cries
Loving parents sigh, finally baby close its eye
Every moment means so much
When your baby's skin is there to touch
Every moment bringing more
That's what mother and father are for

Finally baby close its eyes

Every moment means so much
When your baby's skin is there to touch
Every moment bringing more
That's what mother and father are for
