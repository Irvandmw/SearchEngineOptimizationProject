Lyrics:


Ooh, aah-ooh
Brr, aah, ooh-ooh
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo!
Eeeeeee!
Oh

In the beginning, there was God
He made the earth, and the heavens
He gave us light to rule the day
And another light to rule the night

The Lord, thy God
Made, He made the seas
He made the fruit upon the trees
When He saw, when He saw that it was good

He made a man, (made a man)
Only He could, only He could
God made you
God made me too
He made us all
Made us all equally

Now you say
God made you
God made me
He made us all equally

Aah!
Aah!
Yeah!-yeah!-yeah!

Wake up children
Dance the Dance Electric
There isn't much time
Who screamed?
Was it you?
