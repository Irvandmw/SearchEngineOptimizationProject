Lyrics:


We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day

Keep smilin' through
Just like you
Always do
'Til the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away

And will you please say "Hello"
to the folks that I know
Tell 'em that I won't be long
And they'll be happy to know
That as you saw me go
I was singing this song

We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day

Yeah we'll meet again
I don't know where
I don't know when
But I do know
That we'll meet again
Some sunny day

So, honey
Keep on smilin' through
Just like you always do
'Til the blue skies
Drive the dark clouds
Far away

And would you please say "Hello"
To all the folks that I know
And tell 'em I won't be long
They'll be happy to know
That as you saw me go
I was singing this song

We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day
