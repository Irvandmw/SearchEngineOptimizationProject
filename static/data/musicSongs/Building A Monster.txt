Lyrics:


Save your breath
No need to tell me you're my friend
I'm not gonna fall for that again

This human heart
How many times can it be torn,
Before a superhero is born?

This angel has lost her wings
I'm building a monster
Beneath all the scars you see
I'm building a monster

You showed your cards
No ones who they say they are
And I'm not who you thought I was
Before, uhmm...

Human heart
How many times can it be torn,
Before a superhero is born?

This angel has lost her wings
I'm building a monster
Beneath all the scars you see
I'm building a monster
