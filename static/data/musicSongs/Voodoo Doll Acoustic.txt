Lyrics:


I donât even like you,
Whyâd you want to go and make me feel this way?
I donât understand whatâs happened,
I keep saying things I never say.

'Cause I can feel you watching even when youâre nowhere to be seen,
And I can feel you touching even when youâre far away from me.

[Chorus:]
Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll cause I canât control myself,
I donât wanna stay, wanna run away, but Iâm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head, and my heart, and my chest,
And Iâm having trouble catching my breath.

Ooh [2x]

Wonât you please stop loving me to death?

Well, I donât even see my friends no more
'Cause I keep hanging out with you
I donât know how you kept me up all night
Or how I got this tattoo

'Cause I can feel you watching even when youâre nowhere to be seen
And I can feel you touching even when youâre far away from me

[Chorus:]
Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I canât control myself,
I donât wanna stay, wanna run away, but Iâm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head, and my heart, and my chest,
And Iâm having trouble catching my breath

Ooh [2x]

Wonât you please stop loving me to death?
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no.

I can feel you watching even when youâre far away from me,
And I can feel you touching even when youâre nowhere to be seen.

Every time I see you,
Suddenly my heart begins to race,
Every time I leave,
I donât know why my heart begins to break

[Chorus:]
Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I canât control myself,
I donât wanna stay, wanna run away, but Iâm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head, and my heart, and my chest,
And Iâm having trouble catching my breath

Ooh [2x]

Wonât you please stop loving me to death?
