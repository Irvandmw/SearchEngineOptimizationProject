Lyrics:


Pass me a drink
You say itâs gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile

Youâre wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, donât reach
Your smile

Youâre holding your tears
Your inside is dead
Youâre eating your fears
In a cigarette

Youâve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

Iâve taken the blow
Itâs all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no âsee you laterâ

Youâre wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, donât reach
Your smile

Youâre holding your tears
Your inside is dead
Youâre eating your fears
In a cigarette

Youâve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea
