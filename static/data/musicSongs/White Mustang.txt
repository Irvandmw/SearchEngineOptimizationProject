Lyrics:


Packing all my things for the summer
Lying on my bed it's a bummer
Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slipping on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer, but I
Couldn't stop the way I was feeling that day
Your record dropped

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

Caught up in my dreams and forgetting
I've been acting like Armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for loving and I'm leaving
I was such a fool for believing that you
Could change all the ways you've been living
But you just couldn't stop

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

You're revving and revving and revving it up
And the sound, it was frightening
And you were getting a part of that
You're gonna hit me like a lightning

White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said you're a wild Mustang

You're gonna hit me like lightning
You're gonna hit me like lightning
