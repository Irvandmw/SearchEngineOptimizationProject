Lyrics:


Throw back the love, throw back the love
Throw back the love, throw back the love

I don't need your money, no, that ain't enough
All I need is some throwback love
Won't you call me your darling and be my man
Take me dancing, come hold my hand

Come give me that throwback love
Give me that throwback love
I need that throwback love
Give me that throwback love
Baby, if you wanna keep me
Keep on giving that throwback love

So let's do it like they used to do
And kick it with me old school
If you wanna keep me
Keep on giving that throwback love

Don't be calling when you're turnt
No, this loving has got to be earned
What I need is your respect
So don't be texting when you're in my bed

Now, now, now give me that throwback love
Come on, me that throwback love
I need that throwback love
Give me that throwback love
Baby, if you wanna keep me
Keep on giving that throwback love
(Come on, Juke)

So let's do it like they used to do
And kick it with me old school
If you wanna keep me
Keep on giving that throwback love
Oh, you can pick me up 'bout 8
Just ask my daddy, it's okay
If you wanna keep me
Keep on giving that throwback love
Alright, hey

Dating nowadays is ways harder for us
We got them Instagram girls just shaking their butts
Taking too much time on a selfie or two
Tricking on them guys with that Facetune
So call me old fashioned, I'm a real girl
And twirl me around, let me rock your world with some
(Throw back the love, throw back the love
Throw back the love, throw back the love)
You ready? Let's go

Come on, babe, come on
(Throw back the love, throw back the love)
Give me that, give me that, that throwback love
(Throw back the love, throw back the love)
Hey, hey, throw back the love
