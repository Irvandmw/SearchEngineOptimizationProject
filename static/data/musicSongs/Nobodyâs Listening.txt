Lyrics:


Coming at you

[Mike Shinoda:]
Yo, peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like rewind that

We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven

But in the meantime there are those
Who wanna talk this and that
So I suppose
That it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt

It goes

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
(Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)
(Call to you so clearly)
(But you don't want to hear me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)

[Mike Shinoda:]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more

I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on

You never forget the blood sweat and tears
The up-hill struggle over years the fear and
Trash talking and the people it was to
And the people that started it just like you

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
(Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)
(Call to you so clearly)
(But you don't want to hear me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)

[Mike Shinoda:]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Up-hill struggle
Blood sweat and tears
Nothing to gain
Everything to fear
[2x]

Heart full of pain [3x]

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
(Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)
(Call to you so clearly)
(But you don't want to hear me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
(Nobody's listening)
Handful of anger held in my chest
(Nobody's listening)
Up-hill struggle
Blood sweat and tears
(Nobody's listening)
Nothing to gain
Everything to fear
(Nobody's listening)

Coming at you from every side
