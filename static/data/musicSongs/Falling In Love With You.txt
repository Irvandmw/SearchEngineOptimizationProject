Lyrics:


I was so lonely
You was so charming, tell me dear
Oh was I to blame
For falling in love with you

Now when I'm lonely
I want you only, ever near
Oh was I to blame
For falling in love with you

I looked at you, I never knew
I had met my fate
I tried to go
But love said wait

Oh baby, you make me happy
Please keep me happy
Love me too, babe, was I to blame
For falling in love with you
