Lyrics:


I got so high that I saw Jesus
He said, it's all gonna be okay
You just need me in your heart
Tennessee whiskey and love
I got so high that I saw Jesus

Yeah, they talk about the rivers running dry
How pretty soon there won't be any water left
To turn to wine
Like a drunkard at the wedding
Blindly raising Armageddon, so
I'm a-gettin' high

I got so high that I saw Jesus
He said, it's all gonna be okay
You just need me in your heart
Tennessee whiskey and love
I got so high that I saw Jesus (Jesus)

Yeah, Joseph lost his job to a machine
And Mary lost her mind to lines of code
You can't see
And if the angels or the AI
Are gonna burn this whole thing down, well
I'm gonna burn one down right now

I got so high that I saw Jesus
He said it's all gonna be okay
You just need me in your heart
Tennessee whiskey and love
I got so high that I saw Jesus (Jesus)

And sometimes it hurts too much to look
Like Moses and the burning bush
I tried to turn away but I could see
And he said 'Fathers, don't forsake your sons'
There's so much kingdom left to come
Just let it fill your lungs before you leave

And I got so high that I saw Jesus
He said it's all gonna be okay
You just need me in your heart
Tennessee whiskey and love
I got so high that I saw Jesus

Yeah, I got so high that I saw Jesus (oh yeah)
He said it's all gonna be okay
You just need me in your heart
Tennessee whiskey and love
I got so high that I saw Jesus
I got so high that I saw Jesus
I got so high that I saw Jesus
