Lyrics:


Ripped denim, baby, how'd you fit 'em?
Baby, dipped in venom, baby, killin' 'em, killin' 'em, baby
Always try long, but you better than them, baby
Rightin' all my wrongs for you with precision, baby

I gotta draw the line
I cannot waste this time
Now that I made your mind
I gotta make sure you're always mine, mm

Where you goin'? Don't go far, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are, love
Ride through life for me, hop in the car, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are
Where you goin'? Don't go far, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are, love
Ride through life for me, hop in the car, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are

You know you're my baby, baby
MamÃ­, milk with the honey
Mean it when I say it, don't be lookin' at me funny
Scared 'cause you love me, care 'cause you trust me
Never ever break that baby, trust me: you can trust me

I know how to draw the line
I cannot waste no time
Now that I made your mind (Oh, yeah)
I gotta make sure you're always mine (Oh, yeah)

Where you goin'? Don't go far, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are, love
Ride through life for me, hop in the car, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are
Where you goin'? Don't go far, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are, love
Ride through life for me, hop in the car, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are

I know how to draw the line
I cannot waste no time
Now that I made your mind (Oh)
I gotta make sure you're always mine, mm

Where you goin'? Don't go far, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are, love
Ride through life for me, hop in the car, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are (Ooh)
Where you goin'? Don't go far, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are, love
Ride through life for me, hop in the car, love
Blessings sent to me, that's what you are

Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
