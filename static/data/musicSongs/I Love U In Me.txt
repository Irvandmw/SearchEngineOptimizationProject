Lyrics:


She took off her dress, and I took a peek
While thunder storm played hide and seek
I begged for a kiss, she gave me 7
Our lips touched and it feel like heaven

Everything I want is what she does to me
She don't blush cause she's so damned free
When she makin' love it's like surgery
And she say, ooh
I love u in me

I promised myself not to come until she does
And she took both hands and a liar I was
No man in this world could ever hope 2 last
When my baby down shifts
And starts pumpin' fast

Everything I want is what she does to me
She don't blush cause she's so damned free
When she makin' love it's like surgery
And she say, ooh
I love u in me

I love u, I love u, in me

Our bodies sink in a pool of sweat
It's the kind of love that u never forget (Never forget)
With u honey, I'm the richest in the world (So rich)
I don't need money cause u're my girl
(Need money cause u're my girl)

Everything I want is what she does to me
She don't blush cause she's so damned free
When she makin' love it's like surgery (Surgery)
And she say, ooh
I love u in me

I love u in me

Everything I want is what she does to me
U don't blush cause she's so damned free (So free)
When we makin' love it's like surgery (Yeah)
And she say, ooh
I love u in me
