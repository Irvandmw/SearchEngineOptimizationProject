Lyrics:


Marry me, marry me
Marry me, marry me

I don't need a cake
A fancy wedding's not for me
Won't you marry me, marry me today?

'Cause I love you
Wanna give you my whole life
And you love me
You say you want me as your wife

And they say, "Keep your heart safe"
But I can't, I can't wait, no
Yeah, they say, "Keep your heart safe"
But I can't wait

Won't you marry me, marry me?
Let's not waste more time
And just marry me, marry me
I want the world to know you're mine

And I don't need a cake
A fancy wedding's not for me
Won't you marry me, marry me today?

And there's no one
I'd rather kiss than you
And that's one thing
You'd swear you'll never do

And they say, "Keep your heart safe"
But I can't, I can't wait, no
Yeah, they say, "Keep your heart safe"
But I can't wait

Won't you marry me, marry me?
Let's not waste more time
So just marry me, marry me
I want the world to know you're mine

And I don't, don't need a cake
A fancy wedding's not for me
Won't you marry me, marry me today?

I don't know what I'll do if I lost your love
I can't be without you

So, please marry me, marry me
Marry me, marry me
I want the world to know you're mine

And I don't, don't need a cake
A fancy wedding's not for me
So won't you marry me
Come and marry me today?

And they say, "Keep your heart safe"
But I can't, I can't wait, no
Yeah, they say, "Keep your heart safe"
But I can't, I can't wait no
Yeah, they say, "Keep your heart safe"
But I can't, I can't wait no
Yeah, they say, "Keep your heart safe"
But I can't, I can't wait no
