Lyrics:


This place is many things, but i'd never call it home.
It's just a building in a city,
everywhere I go.
This place is many things but i can't call it home,
Home is the place you are.
And i've done a few things i wasn't proud of, 
Might have said a few things that hurt you,
But you're still the only one who fills me up, 
And every night spent alone, was worth it.

[Chorus]
You are my home, 
You are my everything, when i feel so alone, 
You are my home, you are my shelter,
when all my hope is gone

And i've seen many things
But they don't look like home, 
They're just the bright lights from a city glowing all night long, 
and ive seen many faces, but they all look the same, 
Home is the place you are and i just wanna let you know,
that i've done a few things i wasn't proud of,
might have said a few things that hurt you, 
but you're still the only one who fills me up, 
and all the tears that we've shared were worth it.

You are my home, 
you are my everything, when i feel so alone.
You are my home, you are my shelter
when all my hope is gone, 
You are my home, 
you are my everything, when i feel so alone.
You are my heart, you are the one.
when it all comes undone, 
when it all comes undone,
when it all comes undone.

[Repeat Chorus]
