Lyrics:


I hold the door, hail a cab
Make sure you get home alright
When you hold my hand, you let it go
As soon as people pass us by

I just need some confirmation, confirmation, confirmation
Just a little talk, no heavy conversation
Confirmation, confirmation, confirmation, come on

Don't put me on pause
Don't put me on stand by
Whatever you want, I'll comply
You're missing my calls
You're letting us land slide
I just need some confirmation, confirmation, confirmation
You say it how you wanna say it

Tell me play by play what to say
Feed me all my lines
Give me attitude and all the tools
So I can make you mine

I just need some confirmation, confirmation, confirmation
Just a little talk, no heavy conversation
Confirmation, confirmation, confirmation, come on

Don't put me on pause
Don't put me on stand by
Whatever you want, I'll comply
You're missing my calls
You're letting us land slide
And I just need some confirmation, confirmation, confirmation
You say it the way you wanna... one more night

Maybe I will make you mine
One more night
Maybe I will see this night
One more time
Oh, yes, I know I don't want to go

I just need some confirmation, confirmation, confirmation
Confirmation, oh

Don't put me on pause
Don't put me on stand by
Whatever you want, I'll comply
You're missing my calls
You're letting us land slide
I just need some confirmation, confirmation, confirmation
You say it how you wanna say it
