Song Name: I HATE EVERYBODY
Lyrics:
Lyrics:


I'm my own biggest enemy
Yeah, all my empathy's a disaster
Feeling something like a scaly thing
Wrapped too tightly 'round my own master

My friends are getting bored of me
Saying I fell in love with a stranger
I don't know what they all think of me
But in reality I don't even

Remember anything but thinking you're the one
And I can force a future like it's nothing, so I

Just hate everybody
Well then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really I could fall in love with anybody
Who don't want me, so I just keep saying
I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't

I know I've got a tendency
To exaggerate what I'm seeing
And I know that it's unfair on me
To make a memory
Out of a feeling

It's 'cause I notice every single thing
That's ever happening in the moment
And I don't know why it's consuming me
Because honestly all I know is

Infatuations, observation with a cause
But none of it is love so while I'm waiting for it

I'll hate everybody
Well then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really I could fall in love with anybody
Who don't want me, so I just keep saying
I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't

If I could make you love me
Maybe you could make me love me
And if I can't make you love me
Then I'll just hate everybody

Everybody
Well then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really I could fall in love with anybody
Who don't want me, so I just keep saying
I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't
