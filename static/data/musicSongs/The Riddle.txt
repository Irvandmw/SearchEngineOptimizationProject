Lyrics:


Sunday morning rain, together we're alone again
And I can feel your breath
Beneath the sheets and on my skin
Come closer to me now, forget about the world outside
'Cause I could die right here
So kiss me like we're out of time

We are caught up
Stuck in the middle of our love
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
It's your touch, gives me a shiver and a wild rush
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
We are all

Come on, do it again
Hold me like you did before
You got me hypnotised
We're all that we've been searching for
I see it in your eyes
And the way your curl your lip and smile
And I could die right here
So kiss me like we're out of time

We are caught up
Stuck in the middle of our love
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
It's your touch, gives me a shiver and a wild rush
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
We are all

Your heart is my heart
And my heart is yours
Your heart is my heart
And my heart is yours
I'll say it again
Your heart is my heart
And my heart is yours
I'll say it again
Your heart is my heart
And my heart is yours

We are caught up
Stuck in the middle of our love
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
It's your touch, gives me a shiver and a wild rush
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
We are all
