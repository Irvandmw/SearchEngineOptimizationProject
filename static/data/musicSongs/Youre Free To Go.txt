Lyrics:


You're free to go darlin'
I'll break the ties that bind
Somehow the dreams we planned have gone astray

You're free to go darlin'
So ease your worried mind
I'll never stand in your way

There's no ring of shining gold
So strong that it can hold
A heart when it longs to be free

The lips are cold darlin'
That once said yes to me
The tender glow, is gone I know
You're free to go

There's no ring of shining gold
So strong that it can hold
A heart when it longs to be free

The lips are cold darlin'
That once said yes to me
The tender glow, is gone I know
You're free to go
