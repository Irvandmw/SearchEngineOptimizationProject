Lyrics:


I was lost on my own
had become a rolling stone
You talked to me
You talked to me 

Holding back
a lonely scream
I was giving up my dreams
You danced with me
You danced with me 

There's nobody here but you and me in the dark
Why do I stay when I should run away 

[Chorus:]
It's a fools direction
but I'm holding on
cos' I need your love my girl
in a mad and crazy world 

Someone broke my heart before
and I promised that no one more
should let me down
should let me down 

There's nobody here... 

[Chorus:]
It's a fools direction
but I'm holding on
cos' you keep me warm my girl
in a cold cold world
And I need protection
and I need to be held
I just need your love my girl
in a mad and crazy world
