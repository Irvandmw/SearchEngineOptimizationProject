Lyrics:


Broken hearts rain on our heads 'til it floods
But I won't run, I'm with you, that's enough
Kiss me now so you won't run

Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Love is an ocean
Swim in it, try not to drown
Riding the waves
Praying we don't go down
And the undertow won't pull you out

Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
I know the waves get stronger
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Hold on
Hold on
