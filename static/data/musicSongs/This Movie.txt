Lyrics:


What, soothing, bizzare world
It was over when you woke up
The bleach stains on the fingers
Move over and let me through

All your useless words don't scare me
I won't play your pictionary
Take me, break me to inflare me
Watch me take these trips that scare me

If I surrender here and defy time, so sorry, come on
Would you leave me, leave me to die?
Would you leave me, chase me in the sky around?
There comes a time where you're so sorry
Here...

Filming, the long moan
Stretch your legs over me
This horror movie
Was over when you woke up

All your useless words don't scare me
I won't play your pictionary
Take me, break me to inflare me
Watch me take these trips that scare me

If I surrender here and defy time, so sorry, come on
Would you leave me, leave me to die?
Would you leave me, chase me in the sky around?
There comes a time where you're so sorry
Here...

All your useless words don't scare me
I won't play your pictionary
Take me, break me to inflare me
Watch me take these trips that scare me!

All your useless words don't scare me
I won't play your pictionary
Take me, break me to inflare me
Watch me take these trips that scare me!
