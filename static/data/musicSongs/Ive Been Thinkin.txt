Lyrics:


Well I've been thinkin'
Watcha gonna do little girl on our first date
Well I've been thinkin'
When I hold your hand little girl, watcha gonna say

Well watcha gonna do when I hold you tight
Watcha gonna do when I say goodnight
Watcha gonna do little girl when I kiss your lips
If all of my dreams come true
Just like I want them to
I know little girl exactly what you're gonna do

Well I've been thinkin'
Oh please little girl won't ya be my steady date
Well I've been thinkin'
Watcha gonna do when I ask you to wear my ring

Well watcha gonna do when I hold you tight
Watcha gonna do when I say goodnight
Watcha gonna do little girl when I kiss your lips
If all of my dreams come true
Just like I want them to
I know little girl exactly what you're gonna do

Well I've been thinkin'
Oh please little girl won't ya be my steady date
Well I've been thinkin'
Watcha gonna do when I ask you to wear my ring
Yes, watcha gonna do when I ask you to wear my ring
