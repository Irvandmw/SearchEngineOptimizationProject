Lyrics:


Eh, oh, Vado
Come to my outing
Pull oh...
(It's Young John the wicked producer)

[Kizz Daniel:]
Stop taking girls on a cruise
In my mind, I'm smiling at you
You know oo
Cos Jah know say
No one can take your place (your place)

Leggo, stop taking girls on a cruise
In my mind, I'm smiling at you
You know oo
Cos Jah know say
No one can take your place (place)

[Akon:]
Every morning I wake to you
Morning, I'm all up on you
And I just know for sure
You're the one I never wanna let go of
Jah knows, Jah knows
No one can take your place
Everyday that comes and goes by
And I look into eye
See, I never know the evil that lies
And the things that make you cry
Jah knows Jah knows
No one can take your place
No one can take your place

[Kizz Daniel:]
Stop taking girls on a cruise
In my mind, I'm smiling at you
You know oo
Cos Jah know say
No one can take your place (place)

[Akon:]
Cos you've been there for me
Night 'till morning
I was calling
Life was dullin'
You have to know that no one can take your place (oh woah...)

[Kizz Daniel:]
Baby are you done?
Now let me talk
Seems to me that you don't know how much you mean to me
That sucks, sucks, sucks
Because no one can take your place (no one)

I don't want to be her former (eh)
I don't want another man to come and take her
Come to my hotel room make I give you loving, oh baby
Suga suga, oh

Stop taking girls on a cruise
In my mind, I'm smiling at you
You know oo
Cos Jah know say
No one can take your place (place)

Stop taking girls on a cruise
In my mind, I'm smiling at you
You know oo
Cos Jah know say
No one can take your place (place)

[Akon & Kizz Daniel:]
Cos you've been there for me
Night 'till morning
I was calling
Life was dullin'
Cos Jah know say
No one can take your place (place)
Cos you've been there for me
Night 'till morning
I was calling
Life was dullin'
You had to know that
No one can take your place (oh woah...)
