Lyrics:


I say "Yes", boy, say yes
Ooh yeah, oh yes
I say "Yes", boy, say yes
Ooh yeah, uh uh uh uh

Turn me on
Ooh yeah, yes, oh yes, yes

The day you held me in your arms
I still smell the scent of you
On my dress, unbelievable
And you were so masculine

The way I felt your chest
Up next to mine
Felt you in my heart
Now I breathe love

You are so amazing, unbelievable
Baby, it's you that makes me smile when everything gets crazy
You're the one I love, no other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart every minute daily

You are so amazing, unbelievable
Baby, it's you that makes me smile when everything gets crazy
You're the one I love, no other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart every minute daily

Yes, say "Yes", yes, I say "Yes", yes, I say "Yes"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, yes, yes

The time you looked into my eyes
I felt like falling in love, baby
And I was mesmerized
'Cause it's something that you do, baby

That makes me feel this way
And I can't explain
You're my joy, my peace, my happiness
And you, you, you, you, baby

You are so amazing, unbelievable
Baby, it's you that makes me smile when everything gets crazy
You're the one I love, no other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart every minute daily

You are so amazing, unbelievable
Baby, it's you that makes me smile when everything gets crazy
You're the one I love, no other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart every minute daily

Yes, I say "Yes", boy. Yes, yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, yes, yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yes, yes, gotta say "Yes", boy. Yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna say "Yes", yes, yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're the best lover I ever knew,
Can't nobody do me like you do
Put that on my last dime,
No one else worth none of my time

Everything about you I love,
You were sent from the skies above
You came here to rescue me
And now I'm free

You're the best lover I ever knew,
Can't nobody do me like you do
Put that on my last dime,
No one else worth none of my time

Everything about you I love,
You were sent from the skies above
You came here to rescue me,
I am free

You are so amazing, unbelievable
Baby, it's you that makes me smile when everything gets crazy
You're the one I love, no other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart every minute daily
