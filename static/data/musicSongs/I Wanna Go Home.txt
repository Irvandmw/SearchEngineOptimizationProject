Lyrics:


Perry, it's such a beautiful night,  
let's take a ride? ~ Nah! 
Well how about a walk thru the park? ~ No! 
Would you like soda? ~ Nah! 
Well, what would you like to do? 

I wanna go home, with you! ~ Oh! 
I wanna go home with you!  
I wanna meet the family,  
I'm sure that they'll approve of me 
I wanna go home, with you! ~ you do? 
an' nobody else will do! 
Kissing goodnight at your front door  
makes me love you more an' more  
I wanna go home with you!  

Oh! Oh! Perry, here come my two sisters 
(Hi Perry!, Hi Perry!) 
Hi Jay, Hi Marge! 
Ah! What are you doing here? (We're just walking!) 
Well, why don't you just walk along?  
Go get yourself a soda! (Nah!) 
Why don't you go to a movie? (Nah!) 
Well, what do you wanna do? (Nah!) 

We wanna go home, with you! (Ah da dee!) 
We wanna go home with you! (What, the three of ya?) 
We wanna meet your family, we know your pa an' ma will agree 
We wanna go home, with you! 
an' nobody else will do! 
An' when we get your front door  
we're gonna love you more an' more  
We wanna go home... 

We wanna go home! Why he's my date! I saw him first! (wild chatter!) 
Now wait a minute girls, don't fight, girls, just a moment, listen to me 
girls, just a moment, JUST A MOMENT! (Perry! You stay out of this!) 
Oh! Oh! I lost my head!  
I guess I'll go home alone,  
I'm gonna go home alone!
