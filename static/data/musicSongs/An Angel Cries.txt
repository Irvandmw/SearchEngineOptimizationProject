Lyrics:


Ooh yeah, she cries, ooh

When a heart needs healing, oh, who do you call?
The good Lord, you know, Heâs heard them all
I didnât want to get Him involved
With this little problem of mine

Since you left Iâve had no one else
Iâve been sitting by the window just waiting for help
I believe He shares the pain I felt
Cause Heâs shown me a sign, yeah

An angel cries in the sky tonight
With a twinkle and a tear in her eyes
An angel cries in the sky tonight
Though youâre gone and said goodbye, oh yeah, she cries

Oh, Mister Moon, Iâve seen itâs just half full
Itâs part of it missing cause he misses you too
He said I look up just the way mine do
Guess Iâm not alone in missing your love, ooh

An angel cries in the sky tonight
With a twinkle and a tear in her eyes
An angel cries in the sky tonight
Though youâre gone and said goodbye, oh, oh yeah, she cries

I think heâs trying to tell me
That he understands what Iâm going through
When a heart gets broken down here below
Heaven feels a little sorrow too, oh oh

Ooh, an angels cries in the sky tonight
With a twinkle a tear in her eyes
An angel cries in the sky tonight
Though youâre gone and said goodbye
An angel cries in the sky tonight
With a twinkle and a tear in her eyes, oh oh
An angel cries in the sky tonight
Though youâre gone and said goodbye, yeah

An angel cries in the sky tonight
An angel cries with a tear in her eyes
An angel cries in the sky tonight
An angel cries, ooh, in the sky tonight, oh yeah

(Come back baby, come back) Yeah, yeah, come back
(Come back baby, come back) Pretty doggone made
(Come back baby, come back) Ooh baby, come back
(Come back baby, come back) Baby baby, sweet thing
(Come back baby, come back) Oh baby
