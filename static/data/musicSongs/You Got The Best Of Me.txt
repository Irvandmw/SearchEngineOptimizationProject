Lyrics:


These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me
These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me

So, here's what I've been wanting to say
Oh, you got me, got me going insane
Oh, I can't accept the things you do
One is shame on me then two is shame on you

Ooh it's like fire, ooh how you burn me up
Ooh now it turns on you, ooh I've had enough

These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me
These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me

So, I'm here just asking for help
Oh, you won't no you won't give nothing else
Oh, you attacked right from the start
So you can't, you can't, you can't, have my heart

Ooh it's like fire, ooh how you burn me up
Ooh now it turns on you, ooh I've had enough

These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me
These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me

Oh and I know that you don't know just how I feel inside
And it hurts to see me cry
Just switch out to me and maybe you'll see, oh you'll see that

These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me
These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me

These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me
These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but you got the best of me
