Lyrics:


In Recognition of your 100 million album sales
In Recognition of your popularity
You take your gaudy prize from people you said you despised
You wear your self-respect upon your bended knees.

In spite of all your claims
It looks like you're just the same
As every other clown, who likes put the crown
Before or after their name.

In Recognition of your service to the working class
In Recognition of your party loyalty
You get an ermine robe and you declare when you are probed
You only took it so the missus would be pleased

In spite of all your claims
It looks like you're just the same
As every other clown, who likes put the crown
Before or after their names.

Ohhhhhh Vanity
It gets them one by one
Patronage and Monarchy
And all they entail, rarely fail

In Recognition of your bravery up on the stage
In Recognition of your bank ability
You get to wait in lines with soldiers crippled by land mines
And you think it's the yanks that don't get irony

In spite of all your claims
It looks like you're just the same
As every other clown, who likes put the crown
Before or after their names.

In spite of all your claims
It looks like you're just the same
As every other clown, who likes put the crown
Before or after their names.

Their name
Their name
Their name
