Lyrics:


Oh my lord, I'm way gone busting knucklebone day in day out, breaking my back for a way out, but it never pays
And we're down and dirty we're the underdogs, hurting for the numbers in the captain's logs and his evil ways
And if the man he don't tell, I see no way out of hell

Light years away from home
Just my demons and I alone
This hammer my key
This mine my wishing well
I gotta find my way out of hell

Oh my lord, I'm tired with the way I'm wired up to grind and hammer and the bitch called gravity
With my baby back in Memphis, how do you propose we keep doin' this
Sucking up to the mastermind till I'll lose my sanity
With no more soul to sell, I see no way out of hell

Light years away from home
Just my demons and I alone
This hammer my key
This mine my wishing well
I gotta find my way out of hell

Light years away from home
Just my demons and I alone
This hammer my key
This mine my wishing well
I gotta find my way out of hell
Light years away from home
Just my demons and I alone
This hammer my key
This mine my wishing well
I gotta find my way out of hell
