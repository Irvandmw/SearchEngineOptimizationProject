Lyrics:


I wonder why it took so long for us to meet
And if I ever passed you on some street
And I die just a little every time
I count the days you should have already been mine

I have waited all my life for you
Knowin' no one else would ever do
Baby, we were meant to be together
Yeah, you and me
We're gonna be
The love affair that lasts forever

You bring to life every single fantasy
You and I, love how you make a mess of me
What I feel has never been felt before
We have it all, and all I want is more

I have waited all my life for you
Knowin' no one else could ever do
Baby, we were meant to be together
Yeah, you and me
We're gonna be
The love affair that lasts forever

We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be together
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be forever
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be together
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be forever

I have waited all my life for you
(You know we're gonna be alright)
Knowin' no one else could ever do
(No one else could ever do)
Baby, we were meant to be together
(We were meant, we were meant)
Yeah, you and me
We're gonna be
The love affair that lasts forever
