Lyrics:


Yo, brother A to Z
Yo, whassup B?
Yo, what time is it?
Haha

It's laundry day

Well, let the geek in the pink take a stab at it
If you like the way I'm thinkin', baby, wink at it
I may be skinny at times but I'm fat fulla rhymes
Pass me the mic and I'm a grab at it

Well, isn't it delicious, crazy way that I'm kissin'
'Cause baby listen to this, don't wanna miss it while it's hittin'
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in
But don't ever quit 'cause soon I'm gonna let you in, but see

I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want

Well I could be the one to take you home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down
It wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget what you already know

That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color,
Confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Like the geek in the pink
Like the geek in the pink
The geek in the pink

Well my relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody
But Cupid's automatic must've fired multiple shots at her
Because she fall in love too often that's what the matter
At least I'm talking about it keep my pattern of flattery and

She was starin' through the doorframe
And eying me down like already a bad boyfriend
Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then
'Cause I ain't comin' home I don't need that attention, see

I don't care what she might think about me
She'll get by without me if she wants

Well I could be the one to take her home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down
It wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget what you already know

That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color
Confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Hey baby look at me go
From zero to hero
You better take it from a geek like me
Well, I can save you from unoriginal dum-dums
Who wouldn't care if you complete them or not

So what I've got a short attention span
A coke in my hand
Because I'd rather have the afternoon, relax and understand
My hip hop and flip-flops, well it don't stop with the light rock
My shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot

The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha so
I'm developing a language and I'm callin' it my own
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener

I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want

I could be the one to take you home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down
It wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget what you already know

I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color
Confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Like the geek in the pink
Well, I'm the geek in the pink, yo
Geek is the color for fall,
I'm the geek in the pink
So I'm the geek yo, in the pink yo.
Geek is the color for fall
I'm the geek in the pink
