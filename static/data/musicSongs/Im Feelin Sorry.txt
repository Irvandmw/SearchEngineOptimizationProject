Lyrics:


I told a little lie, baby I made you cry
That's why I'm feelin' blue
I'm feelin' sorry, I lied to you

I took your little heart, I tore it all apart
Now I'm missin' you
I'm feelin' sorry, I couldn't be true

I should have known better, I should have been truer
Well I know that you're blue, but baby I'm bluer

Ooh, I want to find a way, baby to make you stay
But I know I'll never win
I'm feelin' sorry, that I'm just a friend

Oh babe

You offered me true love, but I didn't take it
Gonna wait 'til you forgive me, but I'll never make it

Oooh-well

I hope to find a way, baby to make you stay
But I know I'll never win
I'm feelin' sorry, that I'm just a friend
I'm feelin' sorry, well I'm just a friend
