[Chris Brown:]
Take it off 
I wanna love you 
And everybody wanna touch you
You're moving right 
Wanna see what's up under 
Then back it up
Beep-beep like a trucker

Nice thighs, nice waist
And you know I can't forget about your face
But don't none of that matter 
I'm about to make your pockets fatter

Girl, I just wanna see you strip right now 
'Cause it's late, babe
Girl, I just wanna see you strip
Girl, take your time with it
Girl, I just wanna see you strip 
God damn, you're sexy 
For me
God damn, you're sexy! 
Baby
God damn, you're sexy!
Girl, I just wanna see you

Got my shades on 
And my Js on 
In the club with a pocket full of ones
This girl booty out of control 
There she go up and down that pole

Which one I'm take home?
Get my freak on 
If you ain't freaking
We ain't speaking

You think I'm playing
No, I'm not 
Let me see you back it up and drop

Yeah
I wanna see your legs in the air 
Baby, don't worry about your hair 
Or those tracks
I don't give a damn about that 

In the club they're playing my song
Turn it up, play it all night long 
If you think you can
And you know you can
I'm 'a give you all this money money money

Girl, I just wanna see you strip right now 
'Cause it's late, babe
Girl, I just wanna see you strip
Girl, take your time with it
Girl, I just wanna see you strip 
God damn, you're sexy 
For me
God damn, you're sexy! 
Baby
God damn, you're sexy!
Girl, I just wanna see you

[K-Mac:]
Pants, shirt, you can take it off
Panties, bra, you can take it off
Red-bottom heels, you can take 'emâ wait, wait
Leave 'em on 'cause I like my woman tall!

Got a hot momma
You're hotter than a sauna 
I wanna peel them clothes off your body like a banana
The only reason I dress you in that designer 
How you go that?
Is to get you out that Dolce and Gabbana!

I throw this money up
She watch it all fall
Toot that thing up for a boss

Anything you're wanting, baby, you can have it all
Starting with my last name
Now they call you Mrs. McCall

Girl, I just wanna see you strip right now 
'Cause it's late, babe
Girl, I just wanna see you strip
Girl, take your time with it
Girl, I just wanna see you strip 
God damn, you're sexy 
For me
God damn, you're sexy! 
Baby
God damn, you're sexy!
Girl, I just wanna see you
