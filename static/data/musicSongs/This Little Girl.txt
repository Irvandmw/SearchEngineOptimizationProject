Lyrics:


Ow, this little girl got my head in a whirl
Got me so excited inside every time she struts by
She makes me feel like I'm almost grown
And this feeling I feel unknown
Every time she holds my hand
I get the feeling I don't understand
I get this feeling when she talks
I get the same old feeling when she walks

I'm in love, and it's feeling alright now
Now clap your hands
My heart says lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy
(Lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy)
A-lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lordy
(A-lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lord)

You may be young, you may be old
But when old love gets down in your soul
It makes you wanna shout, OW!
It makes you wanna clap your hands, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

My heart says lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy
(Lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy, lordy)
A-lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lordy
(A-lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lord)

This little girl put a beating down on my heart
That spot is tearing me apart
Yeah, it's alright, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, ohâ¦
This little girl, yes, she got me where she want me
She got me where she want me
And I like it like that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, tell 'em all why I like this little girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Now this little girlâ¦
