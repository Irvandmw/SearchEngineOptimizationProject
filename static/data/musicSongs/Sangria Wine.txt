[Pharrell Williams:]
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper (mhm)
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her (woo)
Never left the city (come on, man) but she swear she's a yardie (hey girl)
Because it's so awesome how she move her body (ow)
She do the sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)

[Camila Cabello:]
Move it, I move it
Move my body like it is a pipe (ow)
Tutti Frutti, is all that I got (ayy)
Counter-clockwise, I'm mixin' it up (mixin' it up)
Sip it, sip it, I'll bet that you blush

Yo sÃ©, yo sÃ©, yo sÃ©, yo sÃ© que tÃº quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueÃ±o de ella
Pero nadie puede, Â¡ay!

[Pharrell Williams:]
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her (woo)
Never left the city (come on, man) but she swear she's a yardie (yeah!)
Because it's so awesome how she move her body

[Pharrell Williams & Camila Cabello:]
She do the sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine, yeah (uh-huh)

(Uno) Wait a minute
(Dos) Wait a second
(Tres) Â¿QuÃ©, quÃ©?
Turbo sauce! (woo!)

[Camila Cabello:]
Let's float around like the fruit at the top (huh)
In Miami, where winters are hot (wo)

Yo sÃ©, yo sÃ©, yo sÃ©, yo sÃ© que tÃº quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueÃ±o de ella
Pero nadie puede, (noo) Â¡ay!

[Camila Cabello (Pharrell):]
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her
Never loved the city (come on, man) but she swear she's a yardie (hey darling)
'Cause it's so awesome how I move my body

[Camila Cabello & Pharrell (Pharrell):]
She do the sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)

Â¿QuÃ©, quÃ©?
