Lyrics:


She has to pinch my arm
to make sure that Iâm awake
The engineâs on and it feels like a distant earthquake
I donât believe my eyes
The planets are passing by
I hear she is talking to me
Thunder and lights in her eyes

[Chorus:]
Sheâs the space commander
Steering our ship
Right across the universe
Itâs hard to get a grip
Sheâs the space commander
And I canât get my feet on the ground

We descend in a magic world
under the purple skies
The engineâs off I am falling free as a bird

Walking on a diamond beach
Light as a butterfly
Somehow she is waving at me
I guess that I need what she does

[Chorus:]
Sheâs the space commander
Steering our ship
Right across the universe
Itâs hard to get a grip
Sheâs the space commander
And I canât get my feet on the ground

[Release:]
Every time we fight I disappear into the comfort of a dream
Gotta find a way to make it easy everyday
Just wanna keep this love affair alive
