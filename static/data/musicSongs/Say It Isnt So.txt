Lyrics:


Say it isn't so, say it isn't so
Everyone is saying that you don't love me
Say it isn't so

Everywhere I go, everyone I know
Whispers you're growing tired of me
Say it isn't so

People say that you, you found somebody new
And it won't be long before you leave me
Say it, say it, say it, say it isn't true

Tell me everything is still okay
That's all I need to know and what they're saying
Say it isn't so

Say that everything is still okay, yeah, yeah
That's all I need to know, if you just say it to me
Please say it isn't so
