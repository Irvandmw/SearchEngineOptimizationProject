Rah
Rah
Rah
Sing it y'all

Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly

Sing it y'all

(My baby is a ten)
We dressing to the (Nine)
(He pick me up, we eight)
(Make me feel so lucky, seven)
(He kiss me in his six)
(We be making love in five) I see you
(Still the one I do this four)
(I'm trying to make us three)
(From that two)
(He still the one)

There's ups and down in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in the back with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it girl, girl, girl

Me and my boo, and my boo, lip locking
All up in the back 'cause the chicks keep flocking
All that gossip in ten years, stop it
London speed it up, Houston rock it
