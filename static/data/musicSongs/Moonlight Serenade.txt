Lyrics:


Stars Are Aglow And Tonight How Their Light Sets Me Dreaming,
My Love, Do You Know That Your Eyes Are Like Stars Brightly Beaming?
I Bring You And Sing You
A Moonlight Serenade.

Let Us Stray Till Break Of Day
In Love's Valley Of Dreams,
You And I, A Summer Sky,
A Heavenly Breeze Kisses The Trees.

So Don't Let Me Wait, Come To Me Tenderly In The June Light.
I Stand At Your Gate And I Sing You A Song In The Moonlight,
A Love Song, My Darling,
A Moonlight Serenade.

We Can Stay Till Break Of Day
In Love's Valley Of Dreams,
You And I, A Summer Sky,
A Heavenly Breeze Kisses The Trees.

So Don't Let Me Wait, Come To Me Tenderly In The June Light.
I Stand At Your Gate And I Sing You A Song In The Moonlight,
A Love Song, My Darling,
A Moonlight Serenade.
