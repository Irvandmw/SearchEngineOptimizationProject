Lyrics:


I like dogs and I like people
Especially the Scottish kind
But Scottish dogs have an in-built advantage
Over Scottish humankind

A wagging tail
And a little wet nose
Can find new love
Or avoid potential foes

But in this small ancient nation
We gather information
In slower ways
And worser ways
Some do appraise by using this phrase

"What school did you go to?"
Sounds like
"Where did you spend your teenage days?"
But "what school did you go to?"
Doesn't mean what it says

Plant and Page wrote "A Stairway To Heaven"
I don't like rock but that's genius
And in that song Percy sings "Sometimes words have two meanings"
My God, he didn't know how right he was

Now I know he's a big Wolves fan
But does he favour rebel songs
Or marching flute bands?
On the west side of this country
To stop it getting funky
As they extend the hand
They'll say like Kissinger or Talleyrand

"What school did you go to?"
Sounds like
"Where did you spend your teenage days?"
But "what school did you go to?"
Doesn't mean what it says

Let's hear it for the dogs
Sniffin lickin
Let's hear it for the dogs
Sniffin lickin
Sniffin lickin
Sniffin lickin
Sniffin lickin
Sniffin lickin
Sniffin lickin

"What school did you go to?"
Sounds like
"Where did you spend your teenage days?"
But "what school did you go to?"
Doesn't mean what it says
