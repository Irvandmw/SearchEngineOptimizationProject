Lyrics:


How does one decide
If the tactics he's using can satisfy
Truly believin'
Tryin' over and over and over again
Livin' in hopes that someday he'll be in with a winner

When should one change his mind
And jump the fence, for the dollar sign
It's a sad thing, it's a bad thing
It's so necessary
This cold world wants your values to become monetary

Why, why, why, what is success
Is it doin' your own thing
Or should you join the rest
Or if you truly believe
Should you try over and over and over again
Livin' in hopes that someday you'll be in with a winner

How does one decide
The tactics he's using can satisfy
It's a sad thing, it's a bad thing
It's so necessary
This cold world forces values to become monetary
