Lyrics:


I donât need no diamonds (she donât need)
And I donât need no money (she donât need, she donât)
Some people live in castles with sixty or seventy rooms (she donât)
Some people dream about a penthouse doll or a mansion on the moon
But I got me a little one room paradise and the man I love (and the man I love)
And thatâs all I need now
And the man I love (and the man I love)

Some girls are crazy about diamonds (diamonds)
Some go wild about perls (go wild)
Some girls go for a lot of loot from a check book that ainât hers (shoâ ainât hers)
But I got me a little one room to paradise and the man I love (and the man I love)
And thatâs all I need now
And the man I love (and the man I love)

Now, if one day he lucks up on a magic pot of gold (pot of gold)
I wouldnât mind a little diamond ring or a fur coat for the cold  (ooh)
But if it meant I had to lose just what Iâve got right now (right now)
Then I donât need no gold anyhow (no, no, oh)

I canât make love with no diamonds (diamonds)
Give them all to somebody else (anybody)
And what good is one hundred rooms if youâre debtor by yourself (yes, you)
So Iâll take me my little one room paradise and the man I love (and the man I love)
Well, thatâs all I need now
And the man I love (and the man I love)

I donât need no diamonds (she donât need no diamonds)
Said I donât need no money (she donât need no money, she donât)
