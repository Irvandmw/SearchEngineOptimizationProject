Lyrics:


Iâve got Jesus in my soul
Itâs the only way I know
Watching every move I make
Guiding every step I take
Iâve got Jesus in my soul

I was lifted one night by Godâs blinding light
And it shook me right out of my sleep
As His love entered in it washed away my sin
And I praise Him down on my knees

Iâve got Jesus in my soul
Itâs the only way I know
Watching every move I make
Guiding every step I take
Iâve got Jesus in my soul

Even though as a sinner I was no beginner
And Iâm glad that I never made the grave
Yes Iâm thankful everyday for the prayers that were made
They were answered and my soul was saved

Iâve got Jesus in my soul
Itâs the only way I know
Watching every move I make
Guiding every step I take
Iâve got Jesus in my soul

I was lifted one night by Godâs blinding light
And it shook me right out of my sleep
As His love entered in it washed away my sin
And I praise Him down on my knees
