Lyrics:


Take your shit and go
I'll blame it on the radio
You can't ever know
I'll blame it on the radio
When the groove is slow
I'll blame it on the radio
You forget me at home
I'll blame it on the radio

Please take your radio
Take your boombox and go
You dirty lyin' cheat
You can't be trusted with the beat

Keep your hands off me
I'll blame it on the radio
Your dick's so dirty
I'll blame it on the radio
You cannot fool me
I'll blame it on the radio
You can't keep shit clean
I'll blame it on the radio

Please take your radio
Take your boombox and go
You dirty lyin' cheat
You can't be trusted with the beat

Enough of your lies
I'll blame it on the radio
All those messy nights
I'll blame it on the radio
Babe this shit ain't right
I'll blame it on the radio
But this bass is tight
I'll blame it on the radio

Please take your radio
Take your boombox and go
You dirty lyin' cheat
You can't be trusted with the beat

I'll blame it on the radio
I'll blame it on the radio
I'll blame it on the radio
I'll blame it on the radio
