Lyrics:


Love my enemies
Love my enemy
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Makin' love to the enemy
Makin' love to the enemy
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Roses, roses I sent they forever die, ooh
Chosen, frozen, livin' in paradise, woah

I've been possessed
They wanna take my soul
Save my flesh I'm in need of your hand
Tracin' back to orbit is where we met, yeah
You wasn't considerate to how I was feelin' then, yeah
How am I explain this to my children, yeah?
I need to find the words without sounding foolish
Callin' temporary illusions, yeah

Treat me like property, whatchu pursuin'?
I need angel, I need angels, yeah
I need answers, who I can trust?
Fightin' through breakups, revelation
Complicated, obligations

Roses, roses I sent they forever die, ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Chosen, frozen, livin' in paradise, woah
Love thy enemy
Walk through the valley, shadow of death, woah
