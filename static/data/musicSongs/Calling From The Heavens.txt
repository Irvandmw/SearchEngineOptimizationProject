Lyrics:


Never knew a smile was such a fragile thing
Only takes a moment for it all to change
She was calling on the phone just yesterday
But she's calling from the heavens now, calling from the heavens now

Sending down a kiss in every drive of rain
I see her in the mirror there inside my face
I swear I hear her singing when the music plays
She's calling from the heavens now, calling from the heavens now and

She's falling like the rain
She's falling like the rain
Falling like the rain
She's calling from the heavens now, calling from the heavens now

She has always been my angel's face
I hope I meet her in the sky one day
Until then all I can do is pray
And call up to the heavens, call up to the heavens and

She's falling like the rain
Falling like the rain
Falling like the rain
She's calling from the heavens now, calling from the heavens now

Never knew a smile was such a fragile thing
Only takes a moment for a heart to break
She was calling on the phone just yesterday
But she's calling from the heavens now, calling from the heavens now
Calling from the heavens now
Calling from the heavens now
Calling from the heavens now
Calling form the heavens now
Calling from the heavens now
Calling from the heavens now
Calling from the heavens now
Calling from the heavens now and

She's falling like the rain
She's falling like the rain
Falling like the rain

Falling like the rain
She's falling like the rain
She was calling on the phone just yesterday
But she's calling from the heavens now, calling from the heavens now
