Lyrics:


In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
Itâs the way I feel inside

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

Iâll never let you down
And Iâll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Iâm just a step away

Iâll never let you down
And Iâll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Iâm just a step, just a step, just a step away

Itâs the beating of your heart
Itâs the tear I have to hide
Itâs the sound of your guitar
Itâs the way I feel inside

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

Iâll never let you down
And Iâll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Iâm just a step away

Iâll never let you down
And Iâll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Iâm just a step, just a step, just a step away

If you need a shoulder
Or someone to hold you
Iâll keep my arms open wide
Iâll be the one who loves you
Iâll be right there by your side

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

Iâll never let you down (Iâll never let you down)
And Iâll never go away (And Iâll never go away)
And if your ever feeling down (And if your ever feeling down)
Iâm just a step away

Iâll never let you down
And Iâll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Iâm just a step away

Iâll never let you down
And Iâll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Iâm just a step, just a step, just a step away

In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
Itâs the way I feel inside
