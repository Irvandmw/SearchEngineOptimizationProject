Lyrics:


A thousand times I've said I'm sorry
But you seem numb to my apologies
It was never intended to hurt you like this
But I felt in the clutches of her kiss
And I wish you haven't been there
To witness my mistakes
Tell me that was strong enough to break baby

Don't kill this love
Don't shoot me down
When I need you the most
Don't kill this love
Your words hit like bullets
Don't kill this love
Don't leave me for dead
Like a living ghost
When I need you the most
When I need you the most

Don't let anger cloud your judgement
Fight it in your heart to see beyond my faults
What you told me 
Only true love can forgive
Just stay with me tonight and let it clear baby

Don't kill this love
Don't shoot me down
When I need you the most
Don't kill this love
Your words hit like bullets
Don't kill this love
Don't leave me for dead
Like a living ghost
When I need you the most
When I need you the most

I need you like I never needed anyone before
So much more I could ever explain

Don't kill this love
Don't shoot me down
When I need you the most
Don't kill this love
Your words hit like bullets
Don't kill this love
Don't leave me for dead
Like a living ghost
When I need you the most
When I need you the most
