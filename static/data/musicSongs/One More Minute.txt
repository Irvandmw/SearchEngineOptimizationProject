Lyrics:


Wake up a minute, I'm a faceless I can be
Broke every heart in town, blew every brain around
Now I'm back home baby, got no backbone maybe
I'll making all up to you

Believe me it's over
Your sleepless nights have passed away
My mind is filled with thunder, hearts a lonely hunter
No romancing will be,
No dancing will be,
No fooling anymore

Just give me one more minutes
Just give me one more day
Cause now the party is over
I'm here to stay

Wake up a minute, I'm a faceless I can be (I'm a faceless as can be)
Broke every heart in town, blew every brain around
Now I'm back home baby, I've got no backbone maybe
I'll leave it all up to you 

Just give me one more minutes (one more minute)
Just give me one more day (One more day)
Cause now the party is over
I'm here to stay (to stay)

Just give me one more minutes (One more minute)
Just give me one more day (One more day)
Cause now the party is over
Yes baby I'm here to stay

Just give me one more minutes (One more minute)
Just give me one more day (One more day)
Cause now the party is over
Baby I'm here to stay
