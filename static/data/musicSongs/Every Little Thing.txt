Lyrics:


Well it's a cloud in morning
But I got the sun in my life
I wanna feel what forever feels like
With you by my side.

People trying to sell your freedom
But they never been held by your love

[Chorus:]
Every little thing, every little thing
Your love is all I see.
Every little thing, every little thing
You make me feel complete.
All the little things, all the little things
Can wait until tomorrow,
Every little thing, every little thing
Your love is all I need.

And I get lost in my instant time.
And I go somewhere else instead
When all you wanna do is love me
You can wait so patiently.
Pull me closer just by looking
And I'll fall in love all over again.

[Chorus:]
Every little thing, every little thing
Love is all I see
Every little thing, every little thing
You make me feel complete
All the little things, all the little things
They can wait until tomorrow,
Every little thing, every little thing
Your love is all I need.

Give me a piece of your heart
Give me a piece of your heart
Give me a piece of your heart
I'll give you a piece of my heart.

[Chorus:]
Every little thing, every little thing
Your love is all I see
Every little thing, every little thing
You can make me feel complete
All the little things, all the little things
They can wait until tomorrow,
Every little thing, every little thing
I wanna hear my children sing.

Every little thing you do is beautiful
Open your heart and let the love come in
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Beautiful, so beautiful
Open your heart and let the love come in
It sound no..

Every little thing you do is beautiful
Open your heart and let the love come in
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Open your heart and let your love come in
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Beautiful so beautiful
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Open your heart and let your love come in.
