Lyrics:


Hey! Hey!
(Hey)

Golden parachute

Do U wanna - golden parachute [x4]

Here's 50 million dollars - go'n leave us alone
(Do U wanna, do U wanna - golden parachute)
In appreciation 4 all the creations we now own - do U wanna?
(Do U wanna, do U wanna - golden parachute)
U brought us jazz, rhythm & blues, hip-hop
Even soul, ohh, golden parachute (Do U wanna - golden parachute)
2 own every piece of intellectual property - this is our goal
(Do U wanna, do U wanna)
Oh, yes it is (Golden, golden)
Golden, golden, golden gold
(Do U wanna - golden parachute)

Here's 50 million dollars, 2 go along with this boot!
(Do U wanna, do U wanna - golden parachute)
Just keep your mouth shut, and never tell of the plan
2 conquer and control the very soul of man
(Do U wanna, do U wanna)

Do U wanna - golden parachute
Oh oh oh oh oh! (Do U wanna, do U wanna - golden parachute)

This is a tribute 4 all your accomplishments (Golden parachute)
The design of a system that allows 4 tax breaks and benefits
(Golden parachute)
Sugar, do U wanna? (Do U wanna - golden parachute - do U wanna)

17 years old, misled by so-called parachute
Down this cold road (Do U wanna)
Into this web of deception (Spiders and snakes and bears)
Money made but never spent, never mentioned (Golden parachute)
Ah let's make a toast, 2 the host, 2 the man with the most (Do U wanna)
They worship U, all up under U, applauding (Golden parachute)
One who in truth created nothing, nothing
In essence, a fraud

Golden parachute
