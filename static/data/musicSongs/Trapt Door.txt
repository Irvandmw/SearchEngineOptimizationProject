Lyrics:


You say youâre a minute from the deep end 
You cut cold the courtesy its sink or swim now
Your bodyâs aching for a breath Iâll give it to you 
With a trapt door to take in of all of this 

Come away come away now
You wonât stand from a fall
Hear me say it 
Come away come away now 
Cause your too close to me to come

Iâve seen the foolish shame the ways 
You just kept crying with his own surprises
And Your Trojan horses is big enough to save them all 
And youâre not a foolish one at all 

Come away come away now
You wonât stand from a fall 
Can you hear me say it 

Come away come away now 
Cause your too close to me to come

Yes youâre too close 

Lost the feeling you know 
Youâre the victim of 
Kick start the clothes let it go 
You donât need them
Only flesh blood and ghouls Iâm the same old guy 

If I were to know today 

Come away come away now
You wonât stand from the fall
Hear me say it 
Come away come away now 
Cause your too close to me to come

Come away
