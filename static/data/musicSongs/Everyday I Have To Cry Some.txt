Lyrics:


Everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

I had a little girl, I guess I really loved her
Everynight I was thinkin' of her
You can't mix your love with money
'Cause if you do, you're gonna hurt somebody

So everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

Well I know that I am just a poor man
But is it wrong to love 'cause I'm not a rich man
Everytime you mix your love with money
Everytime you're gonna love somebody

So everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry
