Two, one two three four
Ev'rybody's talking about
Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism
This-ism, that-ism, is-m, is-m, is-m. 

All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance 

C'mon
Ev'rybody's talking about Ministers,
Sinisters, Banisters and canisters
Bishops and Fishops and Rabbis and Pop eyes,
And bye bye, bye byes. 

All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance 

Let me tell you now

Flagellation, regulation, integrations,
Meditations, United Nations,
Congratulations.
