Lyrics:


I know you wanted me to keep my mouth shut
Because you hate it when I speak my mind
I suffer through but it feels so messed up
Like my opinion is a waste of time
We never wanted it to be this way
They never listen to a word we say

So scream your heart out
You are the chosen
You got to show them
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
We are the broken
We gotta show them
Silence is the enemy

You take your needles and sew my mouth shut
But you will never hear the last of me
This is the reason that we're all so fucked up
You are the reason that we don't believe
We never wanted it to be this way
They never listen to a word we say

So scream your heart out
You are the chosen
You gotta show them
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
We are the broken
We gotta show them
Silence is the enemy

Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy

You gotta show them
Silence is the enemy

Scream your heart out
You are the chosen
You gotta show them
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
We are the broken
We gotta show them
Silence is the enemy

Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy
