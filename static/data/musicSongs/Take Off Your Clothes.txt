Lyrics:


Now the silence falls on us
And the stars are shining down on enemies and friends
And when the moonlight shines on your cheek
When the wind takes your hair
I've got a feeling for a short time
There's nothing I need to fear

Some day the time will drive us home
To a place where you need no telephone
Some day 

[Chorus:]
Take off your clothes 
Take off your clothes
Take off your clothes 

Now the silence falls on us
And the stars are shining down on enemies and friends
A silent whisper echoes in my ear
Like thousand voices crying in the air
Come on baby let's do it before
"love" becomes an ancient word

Some day the time will drive us home
To a place where you need no telephone
Some day 

[Chorus:]
Take off your clothes
Take off your clothes 
Take off your clothes
Take off your clothes (come on come on before it's too late)
Take off your clothes (we've got to show Nature we know)
Take off your clothes
