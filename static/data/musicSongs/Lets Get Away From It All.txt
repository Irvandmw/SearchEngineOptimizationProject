Lyrics:


Let's take a boat to bermuda
Let's take a plane to saint paul.
Let's take a kayak to quincy or nyack,
Let's get away from it all.

Let's take a trip in a trailer
No need to come back at all.
Let's take a powder to boston for chowder,
Let's get away from it all.

We'll travel 'round from town to town,
We'll visit ev'ry state.
I'll repeat, "I love you sweet!"
In all the forty-eight.

Let's go again to niag'ra
This time we'll look at the fall.
Let's leave our hut, dear,
Get out of our rut, dear,
Let's get away from it all.
