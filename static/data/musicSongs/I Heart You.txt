Lyrics:


Sitting here, thinking of you
With a candle lit, fantasizing
I feel your lips, your tender kiss
Just move
What am I gonna do?

I love you, ooh, I love you
Drive me crazy, thinking about my baby
I love you, but you love her
Drive me crazy, what am I gonna do?

How I need you, need you so much
Want your touch, it's so electric
It's like men in black
A full attack
When you move
Darling if you look at me
You would see, how good it could be
I can't deny it
Damn I know it's strong
I thought you turn me on
It's just through
What am I gonna do?

I love you, ooh, I love you
Drive me crazy, thinking about my baby
I love you, but you love her
Drive me crazy, what am I gonna do?

I love it, I love you

I think I'm gonna dance
Dance my troubles all away
I think I'm gonna dance
I think I'm gonna dance
I think I'm gonna dance

I love you, ooh, I love you
Drive me crazy, thinking about my baby
I love you, but you love her
Drive me crazy, what am I gonna do?

I love you, ooh, I love you
Drive me crazy, thinking about my baby
I love you, but you love her
Drive me crazy, what am I gonna do?
