Lyrics:


I will always remember
The first time that we met
And the first time that I kissed your lips
Is a thing I won't forget
The special way you held me
Is the way you hold me still
And I knew right then that you loved me 
And I know you always will 

Ain't that love
Ain't that how it's supposed to be
When two hearts come together as one
Just like you and me
Ain't that love
Shining in your eyes
Heaven sent from up above
Ain't that love 

My grandma and grandpa
My momma and my dad
Didn't have a lot of things
But love is what they had
Their love kept them together
Through the many years
Though life was hard
They shared it all
Through the laughter and the tears 

Ain't that love
Ain't that how it's supposed to be
When two hearts come together as one
Just like you and me
Ain't that love
Shining in your eyes
Heaven sent from up above
Ain't that love 

Baby you're the sunshine
That brightens up my day
And I will always stand by you
Darlin' come what may
And I will always love you
To have and to hold
And I'll keep my every promise to you
With this band of gold 

Ain't that love
Ain't that how it's supposed to be
When two hearts come together as one
Just like you and me
Ain't that love
Shining in your eyes
Heaven sent from up above
Ain't that love 

Heaven sent from up above
Ain't that love
