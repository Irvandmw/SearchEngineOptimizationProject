Lyrics:


There's a river way out yonder
Beyond the valley, across the plain
There's a river where I'm goin'
When my Savior calls my name

No more cryin', no more weepin'
No more sad or lonely days
'Cause on that river, I'll be smilin'
When my Savior calls my name

And we will sing sweet hallelujahs
Praises to our glorious King
Won't you come with us
To the river
The river of happiness
The river of happiness
