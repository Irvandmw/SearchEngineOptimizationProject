Lyrics:


All the trees alight
All the holly's streaming
The town has come to life
Waiting for Christmas

I still feel alone
Searching for some meaning
Until you come home
I'm waiting for Christmas with you

Christmas without you
A long dark shade of blue
I feel like I've been waiting here forever

All the gifts arrived
All the children singing
Gathered 'round the fire
Waiting for Christmas

I could sing along
But I can't find the meaning
The melody feels wrong
I'm waiting for Christmas with you

When I see your face
On this Christmas day
I'll know the light of love brought us together

But until that hour
My eyes will be wide open
I'm like a little child
Waiting for Christmas

When that morning comes
We can count our blessings
It was worth it all along
Waiting for Christmas with you
