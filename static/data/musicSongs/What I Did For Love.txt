Lyrics:


Kiss today goodbye
The sweetness and the sorrow
We did what we had to do
And I can't regret what I did for love
What I did for love

Hey, look, my eyes are dry
The gift was ours to borrow
It's as if we always knew
But I won't forget what I did for love
What I did for love

Gone, love is never, never, never gone
As we travel on, sweet love's what we'll remember

Now, honey, kiss today good, ah, kiss and goodbye
And then point me, point me toward tomorrow
Wish me luck, would you do that baby?
I do it for you
Can't forget (can't forget)
And I won't regret (won't regret)
What I did, what I did for love

Gone, love is never, ever, ever gone
As we travel on, sweet love's what we'll remember

Kiss today, kiss and goodbye
Point me toward tomorrow
And wish me luck, would you do that baby?
I do the same, ooh, I do it for you, eh
Can't forget (can't forget)
Won't regret (won't regret)
What I did, what I did for love (uuh...)
What I did for love (uuh...)
What I did for love (uuh...)
