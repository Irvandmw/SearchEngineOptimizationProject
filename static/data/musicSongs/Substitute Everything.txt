Lyrics:


[Hook]
Iâm takin pain pills, Iâm takin pain pills (why?) 
Wishing it can take away the pain 
Smoke a lot of kush, I smoke a lot of kush (for what?)
Thinking I can blow away some things 
Iâm sippin codeine, Iâm sippin codeine (why you sippin?)
Wishing I could slow down fame
(How you manage this lifestyle?)
Iâm tryin' to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything 
Iâm tryin' to substitute everything
Iâm tryin' to substitute everything
Iâm tryin' to substitute everything

[Verse 1]
Today I took a Xanax, I started miss some family
I don't see them as much, I know they feel abandoned
I'm workin til I pass out and I don't understand it 
From where I come from every moment we tryna take advantage
I got my prescription prescribed and I ain't hit the pharmacy
I got some homies that done died been on my mind mentally
Roll up the kush and letâs get high and take off to a galaxy
I just wanna be in my zone where nothing bothers me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I believe hard times made me like this
I donât leave the studio, I like making hits 
Thereâs broken relationships that I canât fix
I got bad habits I picked up I canât kick 
I need my herb, I need my syrup
Now Iâm free like a bird 
I make a lot of millz, I had to pop a pill 
Just to get a thrill You don't know how I feel

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This bitch filed for child-support like I donât take care of my child 
She want them stacks I got on me, she wanna see me down
I had to take a molly, it lift me off the ground
I watch my dreams come true, I wish my granddad see me now (rest in peace)
Iâm tryin to keep everybody happy, bringing me stress
Everything come and collect, when I'm smoking on sex (Kush)
Maybe this is the sound of faith, maybe this a test
I spend a lot of money so I donât get depressed

[Hook]
