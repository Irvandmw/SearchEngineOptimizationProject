Lyrics:


Take a look around this lonely place
Where a mask is worn on every face
And painted lips gently kiss 
The end of their cigarettes

This world is dressed in such finess
To cover all the emptiness 
We're standing here in between 
The pages of a magazine 

[Chorus:]
You'll never know what I feel inside me
I'll never know what you think about
Untill we share what we keep in private
Untill we find what we're living without

Our shadows move across the wall
No promises no talk at all
Inside the crowd we dance alone
With faces made of stone

[Chorus:]
You'll never know what I feel inside me
I'll never know what you think about
Untill we share what we keep in private
Untill we find what we're living without
