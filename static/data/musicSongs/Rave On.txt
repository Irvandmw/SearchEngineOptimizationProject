Lyrics:


Little things you say and do, make me wanna be with you
Rave on it's a crazy feelin'
I know it's got me reelin'
When you say, you say you love me, rave on

The way you dance and hold me tight, the way your kisses say goodnight
Rave on it's a crazy feelin'
And I know it's got me reelin'
When you say, you say you love me, rave on
Rave on it's a crazy feelin'
I know it's got me reelin'
When I'm so glad that you're leavin' your love for me
Rave on, come on and tell me, tell me, not to be lonely
Tell me, you love me only, rave on
Rave on it's a crazy feelin'
I know it's got me reelin'
I'm so glad that you're leavin' your love for me
Rave on, come on and tell me, tell me, not to be lonely
Tell me, you love me only, rave on
