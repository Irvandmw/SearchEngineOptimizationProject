Lyrics:


[50 Cent - Verse 1]
Try to remain calm, youâre fucking with a don
Pocket full of green, green in the bong
That bitch with the bow leg stance turning me on
Two little timepiece?
Niggas still want me dead like Osamâ
But they ain't gonâ make, they come at me wrong
Them niggas all workers I smack the shit out theyâre bosses
Ferrari, Iâm stronger than 5 hundred horses
Money is power, you niggas better wake up
My earrings blinking, thatâs old shit from Jacob
Add it up, 4 plus 4 thatâs 8 carats
You canât run and get ya [?], you ain't got it
Blackjack we do that, 10 grand a hand
You could get shot fucking with Floyd thatâs my man
Billionaire brotherhood, we call this the money team
Pinky ring flawless, my God Iâm gorgeous

[Hook]
Remain calm, youâre fucking with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, youâre fucking with a don
Remain calm, donât ring the alarm
Remain calm, youâre fucking with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, youâre fucking with a don
Remain calm, this a Al Qaeda bomb

[Snoop Dogg]
Iâm chillinâ like a villain while Iâm dealinâ I am
Rulinâ while Iâm coolinâ with my tool in my hand
Post up, coast up, this is my life bitch
Up close only, youâll get stuck with a knife bitch
Cuz burnt out, turnt out like a light switch
Got a lot of hoes but Charmaine, thatâs my white bitch
The rest of my bitches, nah, they ainât gonna like this
But I donât give a fuck cause they all love this night stick
But I still remain calm, bang and drop bombs
Collar popped up cool as the Fonz
Motherfucker, have a seat and loosen up
Get a glass of some gin now juice it up
Deuces up
See thereâs a line there for a reason
And if you cross it no more breathinâ
Youâre leavinâ, believe it
We understand each other
Cause I would hate to have to put a slug in you brother
Ya digg?

[Hook]

[Precious Paris]
With Fifâ on that shit, that glock cocked in ya face
My twat cocked in ya face, you know you wanâ taste
Alexander McQueen, strapless with my back out
6 inch Givenchyâs and bitch finna act out
Niggas on my heels tryna find out what the head like
I know what the bread like
My [?] headlight, shine like I shine
Night or day time
But nah, nana-nah-na
Make a nigga walk by, everything I say by
Nana-nah-na
Get wet I got that comeback
Dead crack, my assets is my ass jack
Stunt I tell my niggas right where your stash at
Youâre fucking with a southside bitch
I go where the money go
Iâm at âem, I put her on the strobe
Get my money hoe
Catch me in Ferragamo
Or Dolce & Gabbana or [?]
Iâm b-squared up, what?

[Hook]
