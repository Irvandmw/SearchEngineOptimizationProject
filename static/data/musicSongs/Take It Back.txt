Lyrics:


If we do not like our story
We can write it just the way we want
Take it back to the days of glory
And the moonlit nights of making love
I just need to know, you wanna go

[Chorus:]
Baby, let's take it back
Baby, let's take it back
I wanna get it back
Back to the way it was
Baby, let's take it back
I know we can get it back
Take it back and get back to
Back to the way it was

The odds are clearly stacked against us
We've been in this storm for way too long
There are many things that will test us
But we can win this fight if we just stay strong
And I just need to know, you wanna go

[Chorus x3:]
So baby, let's take it back
Baby, let's take it back
I wanna get it back
Back to the way it was
Baby, let's take it back
I know we can get it back
Take it back and get back to
Back to the way it was

[x2:]
Take it back to love
Let's get back to love
Take it back to love
