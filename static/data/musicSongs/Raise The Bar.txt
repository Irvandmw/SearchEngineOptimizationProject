Lyrics:


[Verse 1]
Your eyes change like the seasons
Your eyes they make me speechless
And you know I met you for a reason, woah
Maybe lessons they can teach us

Teach us how to run, teach us how to fly
Teach you and I to give each other everything

We should raise the bar
We set the standards
We should raise the bar
We got the answer

Let's take it to the next level babe
I wanna make you fall in love again
I know it's hard to trust a man
But I'mma do what I can
Get through the insecurities
Make sure that your heart is at ease
Gotta feel secure, if you wanna be sure

Teach us how to run, teach us how to fly
Teach you and I to give each other everything

We should raise the bar
We set the standards
We should raise the bar
We got the answer
