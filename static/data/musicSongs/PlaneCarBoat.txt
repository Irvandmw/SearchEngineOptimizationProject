Lyrics:


[Hook: Mac]
Itâs a plane, itâs a car, itâs a boat
A planecarboat
A planecarboat
Itâs a plane, itâs a car, itâs a boat
A planecarboat, a planecarboat
A planecarboat, a planecarboat

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Q, My pants gon sag forever, my top gon drop whenever
My gun gon shoot whatever, your ho gon love me bruh
Richard James rag, that pussy came fast
All of this Balmain, look like I fell out a plane
Walkinâ on water, impressinâ your daughter
Nothing [?] itâs a button for me
You got a key and them twentys is weak
Lookinâ like you done got that from the auction
When did you floss and (lose that shit)?
Not a scent, late for rent (road kill)
[?] for the ass clap contest
All the home girls tryna fuck me after
Give me head and turn me to a conscience rapper
I could tell you how the world begun âem
Virgin Mary slutty sisterâs son
At birth I was meant to come
Take over the world and fornicate with girls and
Dogging these kittiesâ pearls, it was on point like Earlâs and
Shit is easy as 1 2 to the 3
Canât make out what could it be
Look up up up to the me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac]
You can taste the wind ridinâ in the foreign with the titties out

Shit a million out, you just chillinâ at your bitchâs house
She on prescriptions trippinâ itchinâ for a different dick to mount

Iâm givinâ out some dick to mouth resuscitation (breathe bitch)

The meanest genius, my style seamless Iâm dope as fuck
Release my thesis, a piece on demons who spoke of love
Openly cope with emotion, only the strong survive
Along with my personified dog and my bionic eyes
Life a cartoon, turn it up
You probly heard of us, we murderers and you curious what the verdict was
Release me please or believe the evil is coming for ya
Itâs me and a hundred warriors armed with swords and we sorcerers
Singinâ Gloria the morning that your abortion come
And so it goes, guess Iâm in love I suppose
We fuckinâ these hoes, bitch Iâmma jump on your bones
Reach in and pull out your soul like Jesus

[Hook x2]
