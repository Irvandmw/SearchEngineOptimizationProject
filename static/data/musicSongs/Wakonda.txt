Lyrics:


These girls want African Manna
Said I remind her of the Black Panther
My answer to Joanna
My answer to Joanna

She wanna sit, turn me
Ride me like bicycle
She wanna bring two friends
Back seat of my motor
She wanna fk an African
For the first time, first time

Said she wanna get the Wakonda, Wakonda
Said she want some Wakonda, Wakonda
She wanna feel some Wakonda ooh, Wakonda
Said she want some Wakonda, Wakonda, yeah

Wanna play me like Pele, Pele oh
Tryna get between my legs, my legs oh
This dick cost too much money, money oh
So you will not get it for free, for free, no

I just want to kick it with you, Taekwondo
Go ahead spread those wings, flamingo
Heard your ponani crazy, psyco
The baddest body I ever seen, no lipo

Wakonda, Wakonda
Said she want some Wakonda, Wakonda
Said she wanna feel some Wakonda ooh, Wakonda
Said she want some Wakonda, Wakonda

She wanna sit, turn me
Ride me like bicycle
She wanna bring two friends
Back seat of my motor
She wanna fuck an African
For the first time, first time

Said she wanna get the Wakonda, Wakonda
Said she want some Wakonda, Wakonda
She wanna feel some Wakonda ooh, Wakonda
Said she want some Wakonda, Wakonda
Yeah
