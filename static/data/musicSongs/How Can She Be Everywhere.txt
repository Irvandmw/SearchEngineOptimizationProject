Lyrics:


We had the rings we had the churchâ¨
The mints the nuts the punch the works
Coming down the isle her feet started freezing
The next thing I know my bride is leavingâ¨
I decided I could use a little spaceâ¨
But everywhere I go I still see her face

[Chorus:]
2 am Vegas strip, Big and Rich there she is
Disneyworld, Taj Mahal Itâs a small world after all
I see her in the strangest placesâ¨
Fenway Park to Talladegaâ¨
Non stop flight to Tokyoâ¨
Guess whoâs on the exit rowâ¨
Rockin New Years Eve in Time Squareâ¨
How can she be everywhere

I close my eyes and try to sleep
Sheâs in my head my bed my dreams
Could be a figment of my imaginationâ¨
I mean how can she be at every single destination
Iâve been everywhere on Gods green earthâ¨
There ainât no way to get a way from her

[Chorus:]
2 am Vegas strip, Big and Rich there she is
Disneyworld Taj Mahal, Itâs a small world after all
I see her in the strangest placesâ¨
Fenway Park to Talladegaâ¨
Non stop flight to Tokyoâ¨
Guess whoâs on the exit rowâ¨
Rockin New Years Eve in Time Squareâ¨
How can she be everywhere

She just appears right out of thin air
Like Houdini she can be anywhere

2 am Sunset strip Ashton Kutcher there she is
Disneyland, Niagara Falls, Itâs a small world after all
