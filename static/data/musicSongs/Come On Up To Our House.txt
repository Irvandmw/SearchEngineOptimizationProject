Lyrics:


Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light...

I wish tonight would last forever
And it would never end
We were introduced as strangers
Now we're leaving here as friends

Every word that you speak is a melody
As we're writing the songs of our lives
Everyone knows we don't want to go home
But we can't stay here tonight

Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
All are welcome at our table
You could never stay too long
Come on up to out house
I will leave the porch light on

You could tell me your life story
I could finish every line
The one about hurt and the heartache
It still gets me every time

Every word that you speak is the harmony
To the song that I'm singing inside
Everyone knows we don't want to go home
But we can't stay here tonight

Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
All are welcome at our table
You could never stay too long
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on

I wish tonight could last forever
Cause I ain't good at saying goodbye
Everyone knows we don't want to go home
But we can't stay here tonight

Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
For the restless and the weary
You will never be alone
All are welcome at our table
You could never stay too long
So come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on

Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
(Come on up to our house)
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
(Come on up to our house)
Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
(Come on up to our house)
Come on up to our house
